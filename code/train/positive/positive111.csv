 In October of 2000 I bought a 1993 Ford Probe GT and it is the best car of its kind  I love the front room and the hatch room but no one can fit in back unless they are under 4  I dislike the performance probably cuz I m used to my old Mustang 5 0  Off the start  it aint to bad  but after 3rd you just get blown away if you don t have mods which I am in the process of putting on  Overall  the looks kick ass  and I would recommend the car for anyone who doesn t have 60 000 for a corvette br br
