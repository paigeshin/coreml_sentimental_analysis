 OK  a little background on myself  I ve owned two Toyota 4wd pickups  one was an ExtraCab  one wasn t  I ve owned full size GMCs and Fords  and I ve driven just about all of the small pick up class brands  Second  let me give my disclaimer  Having owned a few pick ups in my life and knowing the loyalties that come with pick up ownership  I am not about to force my preference on anyone  However  I can honestly say that without any hesitation that I have never been happier with the truck I am driving today  I bought my 2000 Ford Ranger in March of 2000  The Ford dealership was the last place I went  only after combing the Toyota  Nissan  and Chevy lots  Nissan went out the window after about ten minutes  Despite the weird looks of their entry into the smaller truck market  the salesman had the ability to annoy me right off the lot  quot that excite  cha   quot hey  buddy that excite  cha quot whatever  Nissan  Anyway  Toyota almost had me  I ve been a fan of Toyotas for awhile and would still recommend them to anyone that had the money and didn t mind having to buy a new truck every few years  Thats my only gripe about Toyota  They just seem to give way and start to feel a little shaky after a few years of semi hard driving  I d hate to see how they fare in real difficult terrain  Another minus  The paper thin doors  As far as Chevy goes  close but not quite  Chevy seems to have a decent product  but I think that if you are going to go for a Chevy  make it a full size  One thing I ve never really liked about Chevy is that they have never impressed me as a  working  truck  They always seemed too  street  for me  On to Ford  Despite having had on of the closest to pleasant experiences I ve ever had at a dealership  the Ranger just worked for me  Solid doors and tailgate  the windows closed tightly  and the engine and transmission worked  and still work  like they should  I purchased the 3 0 V6  and so far have had no problems  Semi frequent obstacles have required me to utilize the shift on the fly 4WD  which has worked like a charm  Only once  on the beach  has it felt a little squirrely  But we survived intact  I still believe that a truck is a truck  and you are never going to get loyalists to change their views on which is best  I m glad I did  though  I guess my ultimate advice is this  If you want to buy a truck  go to every brand dealer and drive them all  full size and smaller versions  Thats what I did  and it put me in the seat of the Ranger  and firmly planted in my mind that my next truck will be a Ranger  too br br
