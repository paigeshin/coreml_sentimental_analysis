 I had a 89 Ranger up until 9 months ago  I finally decided to look for something newer  I also have a Bronco  so I was already set on a Ford product  After going from lot to lot  town to town  I finally found just what I was looking for The truck I bought is a 99 XLT Ranger 4X4 Supercab  quadcab  It has the 3 0 engine as I don t need the 4 0 which has a few more hp and less mpg I have no problem pulling a boat with this truck  I have the automatic  with overdrive transmission My hardest decision was whether to get the flarebed or straightbed  I went with the flarebed  It looks so much better This is a very sporty truck that lacks no power  It is a very comfortable ride with minimal windnoise I have had it in the mud and snow on several occasions  No problem  I have the  off road package  4wheel drive with the skid plates on the transmission  It came equipped with driver airbag and passenger airbag  The passenger airbag can be disengaged  Good feature  My truck is loaded with the exception of the power package  which consists of power doors locks and mirrors  I am very satisfied with this purchase  The sound system is awesome The Ranger was the best small truck I test drove  and had the best overall looks  I know  performance comes first  and it performs  trust me on this I love the way this truck handles  on and off road The ONLY setback is the bed  inside to inside  is not 48 quot  wide I understand that we are all different and have different needs  So  if you are looking for a truck  take a look at the Ranger  This is my first NEW auto purchase  as I have always preferred buying used br br
