 I bought this truck new in 1988 and it s still going strong today  I expect to get at least 15 years use out of this truck with relatively minor repairs and if I get that then I will be pushing it to get 20 years The truck has been used very heavily   pulling four horse trailer  loaded about 11 000  pounds  on a Class IV hitch weekly for about 5 years  Also about 200 bales of hay a month and 2 tons of grain  It has been run back and forth from Halifax to Toronto  sometimes with horses  sometimes without since 1989 and has never yet failed me on the road  The most common repair on it  outside of body repairs and regular wear out and maintenance  has been U joints   and since I have sold my trailer  I am now getting about five years on the U joints instead of 12 18 months  The trailer pulling seems to affect the wear on the u joints  Most parts that have been replaced on the truck have been due failure dut to rust  not wear out or failed parts Electrical can be a big problem on these trucks   the big gang connector on the wiring harness caused about three months worth of grief in 1995   the plug was cut out and all the wires were hard wired together  siliconed and there have been no problems since Body has been a problem with the truck   perforation and paint  Ford re painted the truck at their expense   a recall  The dealer was supposed to take the truck down to bare metal and re prime and paint it  As well all rust was to be repaired  The dealer did a really poor job   in fact I think Ford paid for a lot of work that the dealer billed them for but didn t do  which has been my experience with our local Ford dealers in the Halifax Dartmouth area of Nova Scotia  Only one repair held up more than twenty four months and that was a panel that they had to cut out and a new one welded in We ve worked this truck real hard  It has over 300 000 km on it  I continue to drive it almost daily about 75 100 km per day for work  Gas consumption is still about 18 mpg  CDN  on the highway  same as the day it was new  and less in the city  Fuel economy is a little less than the GM and Dodge trucks are getting but the repairs according to friends with these trucks are fewer  Fuel economy pulling a trailer is AWFUL with this 5 0 litre eight cylinder  you need the diesel for any kind of economy  but  it s totally reliable and never breaks down and hauls loads that are twice what the truck is rated for  A friend and I do the exactly same thing with our trucks   my Ford and her GM   and the Ford wins out hands down every time   and it takes about a fifty percent heavier payload than her GM will It s a typical truck   lousy in the snow and on icy roads   you need about 500 lbs of ballast over the back axle on bad roads  The four wheel drive version might keep on going through the snow and icy roads but wait until you try to stop the 4 wheel drive truck once you get them going It hauls a real heavy load   we installed a set of Timbren hollow rubber springs  tow truck kit  and are still running on the original springs if you can believe it   no re arching and no broken leaves  I have been hauling up to one tonne in the box  grain  with no problems by using these Timbren hollow rubber springs  Looks and handles like there is no load in the truck These trucks are not for city people   even though they are really comfortable for city and long distance driving  They re a  quot amp  to park in the city parking lots and on the streets  they re hard on gas in the city and if you have the full size box  and what s the point on getting anything but  and extended cab they just don t fit in the garage of most city homes   coming in at about twenty feet long But they re just great for us country folk and while I will never buy another Ford car  I definitely will buy another Ford truck  I m real happy with this one  It has cost us a lot less on repairs than anything we have owned in years  It s consistent  It s fixable  Ford s service manuals are very good which helps  If you buy a used one and it s rust proofed  you should get years more on it  Even if it s not rust proofed  at least it is entirely fixable   right down to the frame  I had frame repairs done last year  perforation right through the rail  Ford body parts are becoming a problem to obtain but after market parts are still readily available  I probably won t buy another new one  can t come up with this kind of cash again for a vehicle  but it will be somebody s well used truck br br
