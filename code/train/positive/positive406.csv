 In March of 2003 I drove from Ontario Canada down the I 75 to Fort Lauderdale Florida to purchase my 2000 V 6 laser red Mustang Convertible  I am in no way a Mustang fanatic  in fact I know very little about Mustangs  I do know enough about mustangs that I love all of the retro touches on the new body style  When you put my 2000 beside an old 1965 you can easily see the inspiration for the design  I made the long drive to find a perfect and rust free used Mustang convertible and the car is worth every mile of my trip  My laser red Mustang is an auto with beige leather and power everything with a beige top  Every time I drive this car I find myself appreciating it a little more  The V 6 has plenty of power for any kind of legal driving and will still pull hard out of the corners  The 4 wheel disc brakes are smooth and powerful  The power top works great and is quick enough to put up at a red light  although it does leak a bit in a heavy rain  I guess that s just part of owning a convertible  I put this car away for the winter  so I can t comment on winter traction but in the summer the stock Goodyears do an excellent job The V 6 does lack the deep growl of the V 8 and the rear end looks much better with the dual exhaust  A new exhaust may be comming next season  The little 15  rims and tires bother me a bit on my V 6  There is too much room between the wheels and the fenders  it looks like a 4x4  Next up after the dual exhaust will be to find a good set of used 17  GT rims and have the suspension lowered  which is an inexpensive job  My wife and I have a 3 year old and the car seat fits nicely in the back  My daughter loves the convertible and begs to have the top down  I put her in after I put the top down  and I find it easier to lift her in than putting her into out 4 door truck  The back seat is really only suited for kids or a duffle bag Having said all that  there really is no other feeling like driving the classic American muscle car with the sun and the wind  I would never have considered this car as a hard top  If you re going to put up with all the inconveniences of a tiny sports car  it had better reward you with the top down experience
