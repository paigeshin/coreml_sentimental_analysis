 I am loving my 2002 premium coup mustang  I have the silver body with the dark charcoal interior  I must admit however  after owning a white 1998 pony  I was disappointed to see the interior had not changed much at all  The same simple  plain interior options were a let down  in that they were boring  The interior seating has seemed to change  in that it is more plush and classier  I did not go for the leather  but I am thinking more  I should have  Ford should seriously rethink the interior options via the dash  My 1998 had an option where you could have the fan placed at your feet and upper body at once  that option is out in the 2002  I will state I am in love with my sound system  For a factory system  it is not sheepish at all  It thumps base like I have 15  subwoofers and the 6 CD dash changer is also lovely  The options to customize your tunes and their sounds is also nice  The only drawback  assuming cassette tapes are not used as much  is the 2002 model I have  does not come with a cassette player in the dash  the 1998 model did  but it also had only 1 CD you could have in dash  I am the typical mustang enthusiast  I love the throaty deep growl the car possesses and you can even get this without upping the extra  3000 4000 for the GT model  I like the smoother than normal ride for a sports car I get from my Stang  but the rear wheel drive can be tricky  especially in rainy weather  The ABS and tracking system Ford has installed  kind of gives a little more peace of mind to the driver  I was also blown away at the horses on this engine  The V 6 is powerful  although not as powerful as a matched model of some other  pony  cars  but it is punchy  My 1998 was a five speed  but I could only get the paint and interior I wanted in automatic  which does not totally disappoint  but take off can be draggy  This car seems more  sedan like  than the older models  The long hood is still there and I happen to like the over sized scoops on the premium coup models  Bottom line  this is a sexy car that moves just as sexy  just be careful on the slightest curve  Wear your seat belt  so you won t feel you are being thrown out
