 My wife and I recently traded in my 96 Dodge Dakota P U with 96K miles on it for this wonderful Ford Escape  After making a list of about 13 cars we thought we d like  we went on line and researched them all  After weeding out those   can t afford  cars  I spoke to my brother  a car expert  on his opinion  Being that I own a motorcycle and haul it he suggested the Escape  We went to our local dealer and test drove one and fell in love immediately  It just so happens they had the exact color with everything we wanted in stock  We ended up with the XLT  3 0L V6 Automatic  with all the buzzers  bells  and extras that is possible  excluding leather power seats  We have had it for a month now and we are finding that it is receiving exactly what they said we would in gas mileage  20 23  everytime  The first tank only got 17  but everyone after that has been at least 20 MPG  and we live in the DC Metro area where we drive EVERYWHERE I would definetely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable SUV with style
