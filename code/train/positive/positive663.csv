 You heard it from Coach back in high school  Your golf or tennis pro says it today  You hear the same thing from your kid s martial arts instructor   You can t reach your full potential without being tested by competition  A case in point  for twenty five years  Ford s F 150 has been the undisputed king of the road  outselling every competing light truck on the road  For eighteen of those years  the F 150 outsold every single vehicle on the road  passenger cars and SUVs included  But perhaps Ford became a bit complacent  for   after its 1996 update  the F 150 slowly lost ground to GM s Silverado twins and the Dodge Ram  Updates to those two  1999 for the Silverado  2002 for the Ram  further encroached on the F 150 s lead  but the biggest scare for Dearborn came in 2000  when Toyota morphed its undersized T100 into a true full sized truck  the Tundra  Combining the nearly legendary reliability of Toyota s truck line with a full size truck was certain to take a bite out of Ford s sales   and slip they did  Adding more fear and loathing is the promise of another Japanese full size entry   the Nissan Titan  promised for this model year  Ford couldn t help but hear ever louder footsteps Fortunately for the folks at the blue oval  a rebuild from wheels to the tip of the antenna was in the cards for the 2004 model year  and   faced with slipping sales of 2003s   Ford rushed the redesigned F 150 into production  The first models rolled out in mid summer  and are sitting on showroom floors now  The big question is   Did the competition bring out the best in the F 150 b What Was  Wrong  with the F 150 b On the face of it  not a thing was really  wrong  with the  a href content 109971934852 2003 F 150 a  a vehicle that came in so many configurations and trims that the only thing they seemed to have in common was a grille shaped like a Cameron Diaz smile  It s that the competition  especially the Tundra  had started doing things better  Ford s 1996 redesign of the line stuck with a clunky dual leaf spring rear suspension that  while friendly to full loads of cargo  is less kind to passengers  kidneys  Then  too  Ford saddled the 4200 pound truck with a standard 4 2 liter V6 so under powered  202 hp  that a basic model couldn t outrun its own shadow  And when you come right down to it  eight years is a long time to go without a redesign  even for trucks  vehicles that generally have precious little wiggle room for design But change they did  the company boasts that they ve touched on every system in the vehicle in an effort to make the 2004 redesign total   and from where I sit  it looks like they have  But again we must ask   Did they do the job  Let s look and see b First  Let s Talk Choices  Truth be told  the F 150 comes in so darned many configurations that it s easier to describe with a set of matrices than it is to list  em all  But I can t draw a matrix here  so let me break it down this way i Drive Train i  2WD or 4WD i Trim Levels i  Five  from the base XL  STX  XLT  FX4  and Lariat i Cab Configurations i  Three  Regular  not available in Lariat trim  SuperCab  and SuperCrew  not available in XL and STX i Bed Length i  Three  5 5   not available on regular cab  6 5   not available on SuperCrew  and 8   not available on SuperCrew i Body Style i  Two  Flareside and Styleside  availability dependent on both cab configuration and bed length Whew  I think that makes forty seven different combinations  but I lost count somewhere in the bed lengths  Those are just the basics   of course Ford offers the truck in eleven different colors and with two different standard engines and two transmissions  You can also purchase special towing packages  including an obstacle sensing  radar  system for the rear  and a snow plow package for your 4x4  This vehicle is in no way a purchase for the decision challenged person  Me  I just took the first truck I happened upon in the dealer s lot  an STX 2WD SuperCab with the standard 4 6L engine and a couple of options  cruise control and the towing package  For those of you keeping track  it was black with a gray  technically   medium flint  interior b Looks Count For Something  Face it  A truck is a truck is a truck  From the outside  at least  a pickup is just a naked box on wheels with a bit of covered space where a driver can sit  Except for the badging and taillight shapes  pickups are fairly hard to tell apart in silhouette   though from the front  the grille shape quickly gives  em away  Still  Ford has managed to apply some cosmetic changes to the previous version  resulting in a model that s distinguishable even to one who s not a Ford enthusiast Compared to the previous model  a walkaround will show that Ford has dumped the raked  streamlined shape of the front end that was so reminiscent of early Taurus models  Instead  they ve essentially recreated the body style of the F 150 s beefier siblings  the F 250 and F 350  Up front the headlights are more squared  and that grinning grille takes a bite out of the leading edge of the hood  In fact  the hood now  includes  the grille  which may come as a painful surprise for tall owners the first few times they check their crankcase oil  Stroll down the length of the body  and you ll note that all F 150s now have a notched front window like the big guys  and the door handles aren t the old Ford ovals but beefy looking square pads with wraparound handles  Further back  flares on the rear fenders have a flat strip integrated at their outer edge instead of the smooth curve of last year s F 150  This latter is very noticeable on the flareside  which is pretty much the same idea as Chevy s stepside bed  Naturally  the tail end has undergone a little change  too   mostly in the shape of the taillights  They re slightly shorter and wider than in the previous design  and the hideous teardrop shaped lenses on the flareside have been dropped in favor of the same light housings used on the styleside  BTW  while I once called the flareside s taillights the ugliest ever mounted on a pickup truck  that was before I saw the lights on a Tundra  stepside  All tailgates are removable and locking  and I found them surprisingly light for a hunk of metal that large  this may be the  tailgate assist  feature  which no salesman could explain  By the way  the cargo boxes are now two inches deeper than before   the side rails are a whopping 54 inches off the ground Now  go back toward the front and open the doors  And keep opening doors  In a definite coup for Ford  every last F 150  regardless of cab configuration or trim level  has four doors  Even a Regular Cab boasts a pair of skinny rearward opening doors for improved access to the enlarged cubby behind the front seat s  Did Ford do the job  Yes to the four doors  no to the body  redesign   cheaters b Notes From the Interior  Ford lavished more attention to the interior of the F 150  With as much landscape as is available there   what  an acre or two  they had plenty of room to play  All basic amenities are present  standard AC  dash mounted cupholders  with more in the flip down console for bench seats  a pair of power points  one on the passenger side of the dash  and a surprisingly puny glove compartment  Map pockets are incised into all doors  with integrated cutouts in the front doors for bottle holders  Where Ford seems to have paid the most attention is not in design  although it s certainly changed  but in materials  While lower end models  like the 2003 STX Sport I drove last month  were once slathered with cheesy looking plastics  the materials in the 2004 have a more solid look  They feel solid  too  and the model I drove had even better build quality than that 2003   already good Power windows in both the front and rear  for SuperCrew and SuperCab  are standard in XLT  FX4  and Lariat trims but in the XL and STX trims the rear windows are fixed  they don t even tilt out  The cab s rear window can be ordered as a slider in any cab and trim  a powered slider is optional in the top three XLT  FX4  and Lariat trims offer a nifty optional  Overhead Rail  system that lets ceiling mounted storage and A V goodies move front to back  it s unavailable on the XL or my STX  The rails  which include transmission of power for a DVD screen or speaker and climate controls  are finished in brushed aluminum   they re incompatible  however  with the optional power moonroof Did Ford do the job  No question about it  yes b Driving Interface  Oh  yeah  the cab  is  about an acre in area   large enough that for average sized me  reaching some controls even in the center of the dashboard was a bit of a stretch  If a potential driver is on the short side  you may wish to spring for the optional power adjustable pedal cluster  standard on Lariat  All trims and cabs have tilt steering  an instrument panel with speedometer   odometer   fuel   voltmeter   temperature gauges  and manual lumbar support  The breakover point for cushiness appears to be between the STX and the XLT  the upper three trims have a standard tach  power front and rear windows  and cruise control  the two lower trims have optional cruise control Climbing into the cab is made a bit easier by a pair of grab handles  though I found them located awkwardly far to the front  Once seated high above the madding crowd in the cab  you ll find that for the most part the instrument panel is well laid out and intuitive  I found the standard bench seat a bit deep  and it could use a little more contouring to the average posterior shape  as it s rather flat  The large steering wheel makes reaching left hand controls and the ignition a little tough  occluding both wiper and light controls  The sound system controls are high on the dash  keep your eyes on the road  bud  and seem marginally larger than those of the previous year  Climate control knobs and buttons face directly rearward at the center of the dashboard  potentially a stretch for short armed drivers  Unless you spring for the pricey captain s chairs and floor mounted shifter  the column mounted shifter makes access to the ignition a bit awkward  Buttons for the optional cruise control are on the face of the steering wheel  always a plus in my book The white on black instrument panel is clear and easy to read  note that Lariat trims have a ritzier black on offwhite look  Besides the gauges  there s also a set of idiot lights for all the usual warnings  Lariat drivers will find one of those ultra cool  and occasionally distracting  information centers with readouts of time  distance  fuel economy  etc  tucked beneath the voltmeter and oil pressure gauge Did Ford do the job  Ummm  not really   it s pretty much the same layout and interface as the 2003  with a continuation of reach and access problems  especially for smaller drivers b Time for the Driving Experience  Ford must ve listened to me last time around   they ve dumped the underpowered V6 engine that was standard in the last model run  Rumors say it will return next year  but I ll bet it s no longer a wimpy 202 hp  Mind you  they haven t offered a  new  standard engine  just dropped the little one  Now standard is the 4 6L Triton SOHC V8 that was optional last year  which generates 231 hp and 293 lb ft of torque  Last year s 5 4L V8 has undergone a major workover  bulking up to 300 hp and 365 lb ft  Much of the work on this engine   introducing variable valve timing and three valves per cylinder   was intended to boost both power and torque low in the RPM range  Ford claims that the engine delivers over 290 lb ft of torque at 1000 RPM  just barely above an idle  Comparison of last year s model specs with this year s  though  shows that the 2004s are are about a five inches longer and 300 500 pounds heavier across the board  which tends to dampen my enthusiasm for any increases in power Manual transmissions went the way of the V6 engine  no word on whether they ll return  For 2004  Ford bought out a new 4 speed electronic overdrive automatic  the only tranny available  Errr  excuse me  Ford  but how come you haven t been able to come up with a 5 speed  I thought you were working on  innnovation But the proof is in the driving  and to tell the truth  it s bit tough to tell that anything s been updated in some arenas  Acceleration isn t particularly impressive  try comparing it to a similar sized SUV  like the  a href content 56201285252 Chevy Suburban a  although it s admittedly better than the sluggish V6  Handling is somewhat improved  though still decidedly truck like  Although Ford brags that they refined the rear suspension   mostly by mounting the rear shocks outboard of the leaf springs and stiffening the frame rails   the truck still has a jittery ride and lots of side to side motion when empty  Ride quality will most certainly increase when some payload is added  however  as is normal for pickups  Steering has been improved by introduction of a power rack and pinion system  In a departure from previous steering  the driver maintains a good  road feel  even through the power steering system  and that certainly helps  For a truck this size  minimum length 211  maximum 249  handling is relatively sprightly   but beware the huge turning radius when it s time for parking  Handling is better for this vehicle than others I ve driven in its class  although I m waiting to get my hands on a 2004 Tundra and have yet to drive the latest version of the Ram  I ll let you know  Still and all  the ride is certainly an improvement over the punishing  kidney bashing ride of even ten years ago  Looks like the influx of drugstore cowboys seeking that  cool  pickup truck look has had an upside after all  Sound wise  this F150 is about the same as last year s  minor engine noise and low to moderate wind and road noise Did Ford do the job  A qualified  maybe  they dumped the wimpy V6 and improved the suspension and steering   but I m unvconvinced that the improvement is enough to leapfrog the competition  I also miss manual trannies b Safety  All F 150s come with two dual stage front airbags  a passenger side deactivation switch is provided for Regular Cabs  Front seatbelts  which are integrated into the body of the seat  are equipped with pretensioners and an energy management system  all outboard seating positions have three point harnesses as does the rear center position in SuperCrews and SuperCabs LATCH points are standard All configurations have standard four wheel disc brakes with ABS  and side intrusion door beams Side airbags are not available even as an option  neither is a side curtain system  This is troubling  since Ford certainly knows how to install them in their other vehicles  including the Excursion and an optional canopy system offered in the a href content 77758566020 Expedition a  Go figure Did Ford do the job  No  Where are the side airbags  the traction control   Line at the Bottom  To sum up  Ford has indeed touched on every major system in the new F 150  frame  suspension  transmission  engine  they cheated a bit there  and interior and exterior design  Where they ve done best is in the cosmetics  especially the amount of attention lavished on the interior and in the across the board inclusion of four doors on the cab  They were smart to drop the V6  but  I think  dumb to drop the manual tranny  the updated automatic transmission may be an improvement but it s not particularly noticeable  A couple of points stand out in my overview of the model update  first  how come Ford can t seem to come up with a broader range of powertrain options  Only two engines and one transmission is about what they offer in their bottom of the line compacts  And second  why do they steadfastly refuse to even offer optional side airbags or a canopy system  we know thay have one from their SUVs  It s my feeling that Ford just didn t quite leap far enough forward with the update  Sure  they ve stayed ahead of or even with the GMC and Dodge offerings  but those footsteps with a Japanese accent are sounding just as loud as before  I m gonna say that the improvement wasn t enough to bring the F 150 up to five stars  I ll let you know for sure after I ve finished testing a new Tundra  but right now  I m not overly impressed by the model change  At the moment 2003s are selling at  5000 7000 discounts  and you ll get a darned good truck for that price  Hurry  though   cause the selections are dwindling
