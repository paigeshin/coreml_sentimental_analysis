 I bought this vehicle primarily for the prestige and looks rather than reliability or rating  Overall  I am happy with my mustang  though she is and can be tempermental  I was amazed at it s affordability and comfort  I must stress COMFORT  The seats are perfectly contoured to my body and the steering wheel isn t one of those hard skinny ones  which I hate  When I get in it and start driving I feel like I could go on forever  You really must at least test drive one of these cars  Your standards of comfort will be forever altered The overall vehicle is very easy to maintain with relatively few problems  My car has 74 000 miles on it now and I am just now having to replace a few parts here and there  Nothing major or highly expensive  Just a wheel bearing and the brakes from normal wear and tear The mustang would even make a good car for the family  if you don t mind the two door as opposed to four door for loading the kiddies  The airbags are of the design that would not blow up in your face  but rather split down the middle  Only the airbag itself makes contact with you  I know this from personal experience   The ride for the most part is generally smooth sailing  although being low to the ground  you really have to watch curbs and pot holes more so than in another vehicle  But  the looks alone would make up for that br br
