 On June 28  2000 I took possession of my 2000 Ford Explorer  That summer I was driving a friend s mother to the dentist on a regular basis along with the regular trafficing of children  mine and others  The standard joke was the  little men  dancing on my dash board  In particular we would check out who accompanied the  little man with the pillow on his lap  I am writing this in October of 2001  This beautifully designed car this wonderful car to drive is still a nightmare for the techs at the dealership  Lights on the dash board disappear after a visit and reappear flashing new codes I am quite upset with Ford that they cannot and have not sent someone out from Detroit to fix this car once and for all  Ford has not supported the local dealership  It does in fact drive perfectly  Although I come to ignore the  check engine   check fuel gauge and  fuel cap lights  THIS IS DANGEROUS  In fact there is going to be a problem and it will be ignored  We are used to these lights and their warnings are going to be ignored at the wrong time Of all the parts that have been replaced  for example  side air bags in the fronts seats and air bag in the steering wheel  wiring harnesses  etc  nothing has totally solved the problem  It has actually only changed the flashing codes and the number of lights that come on  We are told that this is the only car with this problem that the dealership has had to deal with  It seems that Ford must have encountered this problem with this model vehicle before or in other models  Nevertheless  this is a Ford problem and should be a priority  I am very unhappy with FORD  Maybe I should be directed to another dealership  But frankly  I think Foard should be sending an  expert  out once and for all I do not want a new car  It could have other problems  I do not like the 2002  I like my car  I want my car fixed  I do not want to do a trade in In all the visits and all the replacements of parts  It all ends up with ANOTHER visit in same symptoms I was told by a woman at the regional headquarters that I had a guardian angel on my dash board
