 As opposed to the the Volkswagon Jetta which I also looked at  this car has plenty of power and at about the same price as many of the foreign counter parts  At about  18 000 you get a well equipped vehicle with a V 6 engine and performance tires to match  Road noise is a little loud and the stereo system leaves a lot to be desired  Overall comfort however is very nice if you are under 6ft 2in  There s plenty of room for 4 large adults and if you not too picky about the stereo system this car makes an excellent all around car  Trunks space  What can I say there s plenty  I put a rack stereo component system  5 units  and a computer  Gas mileage is pretty good however they only put a 13 gallon tank in the car so it seems like you re filling up all the time  I average about 300 miles per tank  So if you re looking for a vehicle that has sports feel both on the road and on the pedal this car is for you  I mean you can feel the road and the steering is easily readable  If you looking for luxury this may not be the car unless you get the leather package with power seats  supreme sound and all the little perks  It s an ideal family car for the small family   wife and two kids  and an excellent singles car that can be used for business or pleasure br br
