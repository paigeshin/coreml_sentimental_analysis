 My wife and I currently own a 1993 Ford Escort LX E 4 door hatchback and never cease to be amazed by its economic upkeep  reliability  and capabilities We live in South Texas and use the car for local travel only   the best use of its service  We usually travel limited access highways and the Escort keeps up with the BMWs  Mercedes  and 18 wheelers reasonably well  although the power we have is  obviously lower  Our  quot little car quot  does 55 to 65 MPH without breathing too heavily  And  best yet  unlike these other vehicles  the Escort only requires an oil change  cost about  20  about every 3500 miles and a major service  costing about  600  every 25 000 miles  How do you like that BMW and Mercedes fans My wife is a real do it yourselfer who likes wood working  By using the hatch back feature  we have been able to haul  at different times  of course  a table saw  a treadmill walking machine  a router and router table  several sheets of plywood and over 10 2x4s The October 1999 NADA values on this car make it a great buy if you can find one in good condition  Trade in  3 175  Loan  2 875  Retail  4425  A really good price on this vehicle in good  not perfect  condition would be about  3 000 and a good price would be about  3 500  Anything above Retail is a rip off br br
