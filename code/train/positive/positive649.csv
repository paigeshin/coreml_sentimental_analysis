 Due to the many emails and enquiries I have had concerning my original Epinion on the 89 Ford Probe  I am writing an update to that Epinion  For some reason Epinions won t let me edit my old Epinion  and so I am writing a new one  The old Epinion can be found at  http crimson epinions com auto review 1F78 E3A62CD 382F40DA bd3 It s now been a year since I wrote the first epinion on my 89 Ford Probe  and I would like to say that the car is  still  running great  although I have had to do a few more repairs  The car is nearly 12 years old now and I have had it for 6  It s now got near enough to 180 000 miles  The Body is still solid and showing very few signs of rust  although the Ohio weather has not been great on some of the underside  The brakes have started making horrid noise in reverse and I haven t yet been able to figure out why even though I have changed all the brakes The other problem that has recently cropped up is with the factory CD player and stereo  The lights in the lcd radio display have burned out and the CD player is being less than cooperative these days  It seems that the CD player uses a plastic gear system to pull the CD in and out of the player and I believe that a few cogs have broken off of the gears  Sometimes the CD will not go all the way in and begins to make an awful clicking sound I think that the lazer is near to burning out as well  It tends to skip alot easier these days  However the stereo is a minor detail and really  I m quite surprised it has lasted this long The original factory paint has faded a good deal as well  The roof of the car has become somewhat dull over the past few years and the paint seems to be rather thin up there by now I don t know that this is due to poor craftmanship or whether it s due to Ohio s harsh weather I still highly recommend the 1989 Ford Probe however because of the general reliability of the car and the lack of major repair work that I have had to do on it  I recently drove the car all the way to Chicago from Ohio and this was a 7 hour drive and we spent a good hour and a half sitting in a traffic jam the car did not overheat at all and we made it nearly the entire way on one tank of gas I didn t have to fill up till we got within 20 minutes of Chicago  and if it weren t for the huge traffic jam  we probably would have made it all the way without needing to fill up again br br
