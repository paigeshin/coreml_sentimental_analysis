 We had a 1992 Ford Aerostar and really liked it  But when the transmission started to go we decided to shop for a  new to us  van We didn t know what we would end up with since we were shopping used  When we found the Windstar we ended up buying  we were pleased  We had to sacrifice on a couple of features we wanted but it had better safety ratings than the Dodge Caravan  which were everywhere on the used car lots We sacrificed on the dual sliding door when we were shopping we were close to having 4 children 6 and under and we wanted the ease of it  But reading safety reviews we realized that while giving up on convenience we were gaining in safety  As it turns out it wasn t a real sacrifice as the front drivers seat slides forward in such a way that a child can easily get into his seat and the driver slides the seat back into place easily  One thing we were not happy to give up was the heat air controls to the rear of the van  Thankfully we live in a very mild area with few temperature extremes so the boys don t get too hot or too cold Our gas mileage has been much better with this van than with the heavier Aerostar  I also like how it handles like a car We knew when purchasing this van that there is NO TRUNK space   it has a lot more than the Dodge Caravan however  It is difficult to fit a stroller in the back one of our double strollers is too big and won t fit  We had been spoiled by having the Aerostar extended so this has been an adjustment  I actually damaged the window tinting film by trying to cram a larger item into the too small trunk  If you have the choice by the extended version  The seats do pop out fairly easily  But while they can be done by only one person it is better suited to two people doing it We have had problems with the LOCKS  We have keyless remote entry  Sometimes either the sliding door or the trunk lock will not unlock that way  Thankfully we did discover that we can disarm the alarm and then use the key to unlock the stuck lock We also have a van that makes a very funny whiny noise  We ve grown used to it and it doesn t affect how it drives  but it is a bit annoying  We ve had our van described as a  rocket van  due to the noise I really like that carseat tether straps attach directly to a metal piece on the seat rather than the floor  It makes it much easier for the passengers in the rear bench seat to get into his seat  It is nice and roomy for our four boys and all the seats are quite comfortable  I would definitely buy a Windstar again and do recommend it highly after all  all vehicles have minor quirks
