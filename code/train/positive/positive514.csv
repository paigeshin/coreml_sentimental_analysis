 We bought our first Explorer  a 1991  we were admittedly naive in the SUV buying field  It was our first SUV purchase  and we were young enough to go for the best  deal   read  cheapest  SUV for sale  Unfortunately  the dealership we dealt with was not the most reputable and hid some of the problems temporarily until the warranty exchange period had expired  Subsequently  we drove an Explorer with bad lifters  anyone who s ever been in that situation can tell you how embarrassing it was to drive around in a car that clicked loudly  causing people to make comments to us about oil changes and vehicle maintenance  and eventually had the engine rebuilt  After this experience and the bellyaching our family and friends heard for over three years  everyone was surprised when we traded it in for a new 2000 model   Why i  they asked   would you put yourselves through this when you just fixed the last one i  There were simply too many good features on Explorers that we loved to NOT own one  plus we knew from talking to mechanic friends that the engineering and quality had improved in later models  Our family camps frequently  so the extra space offered by SUV s is a must have   Why not get a mini van i  you might ask  Living in Michigan with a difficult to plow driveway and the winter precipitation plus camping in rural areas only accessible via very rough two track areas  we ve learned that an SUV is an excellent choice for our situation  It s not just about the looks  although we do like the sleek design  but just as much about function  Also  I play keyboards and will frequently haul a large load of equipment  so secure  sheltered space is definitely a NEED for us  I ve owned a pickup in the past and prefer an SUV for this purpose  Plus we can have more passengers along with the equipment Knowing what we liked in an SUV  we shopped around the SUV market and eventually decided on another Explorer for many different reason  We ended up leasing a 2000 Explorer XLS with a V6  automatic transmission  and lots of nice features b Convenience Features  In addition to standard power locks  there is another lock unlock switch located just inside the opening rear window  NICE FEATURE  This allows you to lock the vehicle after retrieving  one last thing  from the cargo storage area without opening one of the front doors  It s very convenient and a great idea from the folks at Ford The power windows are  well  powerful  The rear doors of the vehicle now each contain a suction cup once attached to childrens  window shades  swallowed up after I had rolled down the window  forgetting the shades were installed  Driver s window automatically rolls down with extra pressure on the switch  but rolling it up requires holding down the switch through completion  Also  the driver has a Window Lock switch to prevent any of the other passengers from playing with the windows  nice for kid safety  bad for a spouse that has angered the driver  Privacy glass is a nice option  All windows with the exception of windshield and front seat windows are tinted nice and dark  not quite limo tint but enough to make anyone in the rear comfortable in a late afternoon driving session  The tint is good quality  has not scratched or faded at all Running boards came with our vehicle  although not necessary for us they are nice for older people who join us  the boards are usable by both front and rear seat passengers  They are very heavy duty  as our salesman can attest  he once had a 350 pound local athlete jump up and down on the bars without causing any sort of damage The air conditioning works wonderfully and is very cold when you want it to be  One complaint  however  is that the output for A C is NOT adjustable  it will only be forced out the vents blowing directly on your face  It would be nice to adjust where the A C blows  The heater works just as well  and in bone chilling Michigan winters it heats up quickly without having to start the engine five minutes before leaving the house Cruise control works remarkably well  maintaining your chosen speed regardless of weather or incline situations you might be experiencing  It is  of course  easy to operate  incorporating the standard buttons which are snuggled up to the airbag area on both sides of the wheel Standard delay feature on the windshield wipers applies  although I m somewhat disappointed to see that a mist feature has not been added  To sweep the windshield only once  the wipers must actually be turned on then quickly turned off  This  I imagine  adds extra wear and tear to the control  versus having a  mist  function that can be tapped to sweep the windshield once or twice The tilt steering wheel is also equipped  I have nothing remarkable to say about this  it tilts the steering wheel  Not too technical here As part of the vehicle that we purchased  we have the towing option  This means that there is a wiring kit provided to hook up to a trailer when you want to tow it  To be honest  we have not used this feature yet  although we are planning to use it this summer to tow a small pop up camper  we need to get a hitch installed first  The rear window is equipped with a wiper that has a two or three delay settings plus it squirts windshield washer fluid  Two complaints here  1  After a while  the wiper only now cleans a portion of the area it once used to  it leaves a large gap toward the top of the window  2  The control is located on the other side of the stereo   it needs to be located closer to the other controls  because it is quite a reach when you re trying to concentrate on driving in weather in which the rear wiper is needed The stereo is quite nice  a CD cassette combo unit with six nice LARGE preset buttons to eliminate a lot of groping and fumbling while watching the road  It is easy to operate and sounds nice  Also it has a mute button for when you are on the phone  although personally I don t use the phone while driving   I ignore it or pull off the road  I can t concentrate on too many things at once  A roof rack tops off our sleek black SUV  It s only been used once  carting a live Christmas tree from store to home  It s unremarkable  but nice when you need it  There are four adjustable little rope loop things in addition to the two cross bars  this was nice when tying the tree on the top We have the fog lamp option  which is really nice when driving at night because it illuminates the side of the road very well without disturbing other drivers  Especially nice in our area because deer making a go at crossing the road at midnight are much more easily seen than without these lights b Safety Features  In addition to dual front impact airbags  side curtain airbags are included for the front passengers  The airbags are actually stored in the outside of the front seats  on the sides  facing the doors  On side impact  these airbags will be there to shield you from the side window  or from the side windows shattering into your face  Fortunately we have never had any accidents in the vehicle so I can t tell you how well the airbags work  The four wheel Anti Lock Braking System  ABS  is installed also  This is a nice safety feature so you don t go skidding out of control by slamming the brakes b Repair Record  So Far  This vehicle has needed only a few very minor repairs since we took delivery nearly 18 000 miles ago  An oil pressure sensor was replaced  and a seat belt assembly  factory recall  There have been no major mechanical or drive train failures so far b Grievances  The one negative part of the vehicle on my list is the interior  The cover for the jack  located on the left wall of the storage cargo area  comes loose  does not open  when driving and sometimes makes noises with road vibration  Also  the interior door handles seem to be cheap  the frame around the handle on the driver s door has gone crooked  Also the rear passenger handle does not seem to be able to open the door  but it is stuck partially out  I checked the child safety latch and that did not seem to be the cause  Currently this is on the list to be checked out during our next visit to the dealership  for maintenance b Reliability  With the extreme variances of weather we experience  we have never encountered a problem with starting or operating the vehicle  It has been very reliable car b Summary  This is a great vehicle for all our needs and uses  It is very comfortable for long trips and fits us perfectly  Overall  we are very happy with the car  We are planning on purchasing it at the end of the lease period and look forward to many more years of enjoyment for leisure  business and hauling around the kids
