 I have owned a 1985 Ford T Bird  1992 Mercury Cougar and now a 1997 Ford T Bird  These are all essentially the same cars  given differences for model years  These cars are virtually indestructible for American manufactured autos  The  85 went 128K miles  the  92 was at 113K miles when they were sold and the  97 is at 45k miles  I had no major breakdowns on any of these and I was always impressed that when they were emissions tested  required in most states  even at high mileage  each tested well within the clean air standards  This indicates a well built  close tolerance engine  designed to last  Alas they are not made anymore  Ford realized they could make and sell a Ford Taurus Mercury Sable  a smaller car and less costly to produce and sell it for more profit than they ever saw on the T Birds or Cougars  Or you are forced to buy an even pricier Ford Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis if you like larger and safer auto  These were spiffy road cruisers with good looks  good gas mileage  and performed well for their size  If you can find a low mileage  97  they make a great second or even your main vehicle  These will no doubt be collector items for your children
