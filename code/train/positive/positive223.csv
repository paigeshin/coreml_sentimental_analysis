 I bought my 2002 Mineral Grey GT at June 1st  I had owned a 1998 GT and loved the performance for what is classified as a mid performance vehicle  When I bought my new car I expected nothing less  I have been doing a lot of city   highway driving and I must say that I m very impressed with the mileage for an eight cylinder  22mpg  On a highway trip this last week  I averaged 25mpg with the AC running very impressive  On the performance side it s a bit too soon to tell  I like to break my cars in a bit and don t like to push them much before to first oil change  I actually bought this car for less than I paid for my  98 and it comes with a few additional features that the  98 didn t have such as traction control  anti lock brakes and a 6 disc CD changer  Ford had don t a first class job holding the price on this car in the last four years  I honestly believe that this is probably the strongest contributing factor to the Mustang being the  ruler  of the performance car kingdom for the mid performance level cars  Fords continues to improve this car at every turn  The quadra shock rear end design along with the other structural traction improvements to the rear end makes this car a good handler on the highway and on twisty roads  This car is significantly quieter and quite a bit more  sticky  on the road than my  98 too  As far as overall power  so far I m quite happy with the pick up  I have also noticed that the  sweet range  for this car is in the sixty plus mile per hour range  This is where I can definitely notice the additional horsepower over my  98 All in all I would have to say that this is my favorite Mustang of the two I ve owned so far
