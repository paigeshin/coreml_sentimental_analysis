 My wife and I purchased a 1999 Ford E 350 15 seater for our growing family  with our sixth child on the way  Our van is not loaded with options   while we have tint windows  cruise control and running boards  we opted for no carpet or power features to assist us in keeping the van clean with active children  and to minimize worries about equipment breakages down the years  We purchased using the Internet  Autobytel com  to locate a dealer and set a price  We are pleased with our vehicle  after three months  and with the purchase process Our van has the 5 4 liter V 8 engine  and it delivers very good power and acceleration  The gas mileage comes in at 14 16 mpg on the highway  and a consistent 11 12 mpg around town  The visibility while driving is excellent  with the height of the driver from the ground  and the large sidemounted mirrors  Due to the vehicle length  lane changes require slightly more planning than a conventional minivan  however the large mirrors provide excellent situational awareness  Both the turning radius and turning response are very good  and were much better than anticipated  Parking requires patience  but is not a difficult task  including parallel parking The rear bench removes very easily with two people  One person who is capable of lifting 60 pounds can remove the bench  as well  With the rear bench removed  there are twelve seats and a tremendous amount of cargo room  although thought must be put into to securing cargo in the rear to prevent shifting Do it yourself oil changes and fluid refilling are a cinch with this van  The engine was designed with easy access to wide mouthed filling spouts in mind  The great height of the bottom of the vehicle from the ground make it completely unnecessary to jack the vehicle for oil plug or filter removal We found the height of the vehicle made running boards necessary in order to facilitate the handling of children and groceries around the vehicle We have found our E 350 to be a superior value to any minivan out there  Fuel mileage and luxury features are the only advantage we have seen of a minivan over our conversion van br br
