 We bought our 1991 Ford Festiva new  and the  quot Korean Komet quot  or  quot Red Rocket quot  is still serving us today  The car gets incredible mileage and almost never needs repairs  and it starts up in even the coldest of weather  It handles well in the snow  and has an AMAZING turning radius  You could park this thing anywhere  I guess the only downside is that if you should get hit in this thing  there s not much car to protect you  Other than that  I think the car has a lot of personality and is a great value  I m a high school student and I just put a new sound system in  and now I can cruise for chicks in my sweet ride while blasting out the beach boys tunes  Woooo br br
