 I was riding with my father in his Ford Taurus station wagon today to get some matierals for the construction workers that are remodeling our home  While in the car I thought it might be interesting to compare his car to my BMW 7 series  A review of my car can be read at  a href auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 http www epinions com auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 a  Some interesting facts I noticed was that the Taurus actually seems to accelerate smoother  and brake smoother than the BMW  although the BMW does accelerate faster  The seat comfort up front is comfortable in both cars  however I personally like the back seat more in the BMW  since it has head rests  and the seats are contoured for the body  For people with families that travel often and need room for luggage  such as my family  I would recommend the Taurus  For those who like to have luxuries  even to the point of having a weather station built into a car  I would recommend the BMW  The Taurus is also a smooth car  as is the BMW  The Ford is cheaper to get fixed  although it seems that it often does need fixing  usually nothing major  A recent fix was the air conditioning  which cost over  500 to fix  One feature that seems to be taken for granted in a lot of cars is the cup holder  The BMW does not even have one  although the Ford does  In the BMW I use the area on the door to place the cups  although it seems it was made for cassettes or CD s to be placed there  Another advantage of the Ford is that it is very good on gas  It gets probably about 8 mpg more than the BMW  when the BMW was purchased a gas guzzler tax needed to be paid  I like the Ford Taurus station wagon and would recommend it for families br br
