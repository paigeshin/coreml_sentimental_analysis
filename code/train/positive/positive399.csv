 Let me start with one comment  I have always wanted another Mustang  owned a  69 10 years ago  It came time for the family to purchase a second car  Since we were already in possesion of what I believe to be the best sedan in the world  a  94 Honda Accord EX  I decided that rather than go with the SUV  living in the Midwest  this makes more sense  I would get ME a car I ordered a 2001 GT Convertible 5 Speed manual  After an incredibly long delay waiting for Ford to build my car  it finally arrived early summer  This car is the ultimate summertime vehicle  Drop the top and go  With the optional Mach460 sound system you will have no problem hearing your favorite tunes as the wind whistles by I am by no means any kind of motorhead  so don t look for performance figures or anything else like that in this opinion  But I do enjoy being behind the wheel and after 16 years of driving I am still trying to figure out how I never truly experienced driving until getting behind the wheel of this car  There is tons of power in the V8 engine  the seating is comfortable  even for a tall man and there is surprising room in the back for 2 young children  I realize that I will have to give up the car by the time the kids hit 10 or so  but until then  the whole family enjoys it You re not going to be taking this car to the grocery store  or anywhere else that requires putting anything in the trunk  There s room for a set of golf clubs  barely  and that s about it  so forget hauling groceries For all of the power  the car handles remarkably well too  as long as you are on dry pavement  Any little bit of moisture on the ground and look for the rear tires to slip  even with traction control on  I fear that this car will spend a lot of time in the garage during the winter months as I imagine the snow traction to be non existent I could give you about 100 reasons to NOT buy this car  but instead I will give you the 1 reason to buy it  It is FUN br br
