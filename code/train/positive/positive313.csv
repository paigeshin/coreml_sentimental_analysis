 Ford is making it very easy to find a Windstar that fits you  First  its only real competition this model year is the new Honda Odyssey and good luck finding one of those  Second  Ford Credit is willing to throw free money at buyers who rate it  Third  the Windstar can be dressed up in about any configuration imaginable Unless you are buying for some institution you ll skip the base and deal with the LX  which comes with the second sliding door  Next  you ll scratch your head trying to figure out what the difference is between the LX and SE models  All the same equipment is available on each  so sooner or later your salesman will have to breakdown and confess the only difference is the chrome trim which mars  IMHO  the SE s grille and sides It looks like the chrome tape you can buy at Pep Boys  but evidently some segment of Ford s market research showed anything over 25Gs has to have chrome  Next you ll wonder why anybody in their right mind would pop for a top of the line SEL  with the garish two tone paint and three spoke wheels which actually look LESS luxurious than the down market Windstar alloys  The SEL also harbors Ford s hyped but likely high nuisance factor rear sensor array  which is supposed to tell you when you are about to back into something but I bet sounds every time a cat swooshes past If this sounds like a big gold star for the LX  you get a gold star  It can be loaded up with nearly every available option  including a rear passenger stereo set up which has to be the envy of Honda  traction control  quad seating  etc The drive train for all models is solid  if unspectacular  The 200hp V 6 moves the machine nicely at highway speeds  providing for effortless cruising and passing  But hey it is a mini van and not a dragster  even though the copious amounts of torque in the low end can come on quick  providing a less car like ride than the Odyssey or say  the Sienna  As dealers are getting rid of Windstars pretty fast  and pocketing the several hundred dollars in factory holdback in the process  it shouldn t be too hard to come in with a price at or slightly above invoice  Couple that with the aforementioned special financing and anyone in the market for a people mover needs to check it out br br
