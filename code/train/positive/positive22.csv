 The new Ford Excursion is a huge truck with lots of room for both family and cargo  This truck has excellent power and still handles similar to an Expedition or an Explorer  It comes stock with a Triton V 10 engine which will not let you down  If need room and always had a van  but want a 4x4 than this is definitely the perfect vehicle  Don t worry about the comfort because this is extremely roomy  I use this truck at my work  I drive a Ford Explorer which is also and Eddie Bauer package  The two trucks are quite similar  Since the Explorer is one of the biggest sellers on the market I have a feeling that this truck will succeed because all it is  is a much larger Explorer or Expedition  One might say that Ford lacks creativity but if you drive this truck you will see the differences as well as the similarities  Talk about power even in 4x4 on some of the toughest trails and inclines this vehicle is not to heavy to get up a large hill  If you have a big family and a sense of adventure than this is most definitely the truck for you br br
