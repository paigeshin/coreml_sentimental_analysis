 After 140 000 miles  we decided to replace my wife s 1990 Toyota Camry  We found the new Camrys to be overpriced  offering essentially 1990 technology with seats that weren t as adjustable or as comfortable as the old ones  So we started shopping around Much to our amazement  we ended up buying a Ford Focus station wagon with the ZTEC engine  This car is amazing It is the easiest car to get in and out of and has great seats  really important if you have a bad back  The doors open wide  the seats sit high  and the car has a high roof line   the seating couldn t be much better  I m 6 5 quot  and can sit with inches to spare between the top of my head and the roof  My wife is 5 7 quot  and can adjust the seat to fit her perfectly  The seats offer great support  too  They seem to have just the right amount of firmness and are designed to help you sit properly  without slouching  There is plenty of room in the back seat  too The  quot trunk quot  door height is just perfect for loading things  This is the first car we have owned that makes it easy to load groceries  The car is loaded with features   electric windows  locks  trunk door release  cruise control  mirrors  CD player  power brakes  tilt steering wheel  automatic transmission  center arm rest  cup holders  filtered air HVAC system  etc  The interior light stays on after you leave the car  and then gradually dims and shuts off The design and placement of the instruments and controls  and even the dashboard vents  couldn t be better  Ford really took consumers into account when this car was designed The car is inexpensive to operate  It gets about 28 MPG on regular gasoline  The car handles extremely well  The steering is precise with good road feedback  The brakes are ABS front disks and rear drums  and in our experience offer good stopping  And the 15 quot  tires aren t Firestone  The transmission is as smooth as you can find  The finish and fit are both excellent The car has a few disadvantages but I would not call them problems  Even with the ZTEC engine it s not as powerful as I would like  but it s more responsive than the four cyl  Camry that we replaced  The car tends to be a little noisy  The manual seat adjusters take a little getting used to  Ford does not have a sunroof option  The radio sound system is on the boomy side  There have been two recalls since we bought the car  an inconvenience to deal with In summary  the Focus station wagon is a real bargain for most anyone  We have owned Toyotas  Acuras  Hondas  VWs  Cadillacs  Buicks  and Oldsmobiles  This is our first Ford and it is without a doubt the best value for the money we have ever seen in an automobile
