 My 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 just passed the 1500 mile mark and I love driving it  I chose Twilight Blue w  Medium Graphite interior  It s a great combination  I like how there is a patterned appearance in the center of the seats I also have the Power and Premium option packages  as well as the manual moonroof  I m not a big fan of having to order a whole range of options in one big package  but I think every car company does that now  The Power package gives you Keyless entry   which is great when you ve got an armful of groceries or packages  you can just hit the blue trunk release and up goes the hatch  Well  it doesn t exactly go up  but it does open enough for you to nudge it up into full open position  Also included are power windows  mirrors  and locks The Premium package includes air conditioning  front center armrest  speed control  map lights  tilt telescoping steering wheel  P205 50R16 tires  16 inch 6 spoke aluminum wheels The armrest is nice  but I have to say that they don t exactly give you a plethora of storage space inside  A bit skimpy I think  I d like to have been able to put my CD s inside the armrest And as I said  I ordered the manual moonroof  At first I was leaning away from it  Part of me thought a manual moonroof would be cheap  but it really isn t  You can fully open it  or crank it the other way and just use it to get some fresh air in the car without completely messing up your hair  I don t like the cupholders and the changeholder  The cupholders are placed in an awkward position and make it a chore to remove your beverage  The changeholder is high up on the dash and is very small   it s cumbersome to remove coins The seats are extremely comfortable  They have side bolsters which give you the feeling of being held in place  but not in an overly restrictive way  I just feel secure and I like that  Also  with the manual seat height adjustment and the tilt telescopic steering wheel it s easy for even a shorty like me to have a great view of the road and not have my chin touching the steering wheel  My Dad sat in it  he s got a Lincoln Towncar and is a  big car  kind of guy  and he had plenty of room also My ZX3 is a 5 speed  which I would recommend because I think manual transmissions are just more fun to drive  A bit of a pain to learn  but once you don t you ll love it   unless you frequently get stuck in long traffic  then you may not love it quite as much as you continually shift from 1st to 2nd  The Zetec engine coupled with the stick shift gives tons of zip  I find myself speeding frequently and having to slow down   sometimes the car just gets away from me a little  Breaking has not been an issue  it stops just fine I m not a gearhead so I can t get into specifics about engine performance and specifications  All I know is that I adore this car inside and out and look forward to driving it every day
