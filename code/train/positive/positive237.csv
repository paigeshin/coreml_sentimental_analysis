 I have a 1995 Ford Windstar and I think it is the best around  I have three kids  ages 3  2 and newborn  It is so easy to get them in and out through the side door  I never have to worry about leaving my oldest on one side of the car unattended  Plus  the van is roomy enough that I can strap them all in easily  Then I just turn around and hop in the driver s seat  There is plenty of legroom  THe most I have seen in a minivan  Even being very pregnant  I can drive the Windstar comfortably  There is lots of cargo space  We have a large wagon and we just plop in in the back for day trips  Also we are campers and there is plenty of space for our tent  action packers and cots  Even all the extras we need for baby like a pack and play  I highly reccommend the Windstar  It is the best purchase we could have made     br br
