 Ever went to purchase a vehicle and you wanted a family car and your spouse wanted a truck  Well Ford has done it  It is the Explorer Sport Trac  It is a combination of both  There is enough room inside for a family but then has a bed like a truck  Once we test drove this we knew that we had to have it  So that s what happened  we got us one  This has been one of the best vehicles that we have ever purchased  Besides being a combination car and truck it has many more unique qualities  Have you ever had to move and were worried about scratching or denting the bed of your truck  Well your worries are over  This truck has a guaranteed bed  It will never ding  dent or rust  Trust me it sounds like a gimmick  but I have tested it and know that it is all the truth  We recently helped family move and my husband had a tow bar in the bed  This thing was sliding all around  Every time that we slammed on the brakes it would hit the back of the bed and I thought there is no way that this bed is going to make it through this  Well  it did it  There was not one scratch ding or dent in the entire bed  Also  there is an extra electrical outlet in the bed of the truck  This is great for trailers  power tools and camping  It came with a hard top cover  The Explorer Sport Trac came equipped with a V 6  But it feels like it is a V 8  It is fully loaded  Electrical mirrors  windows  locks and driver seats  There are leather seats There is an overhead counsel that indicates direction and the temperature  It will also let you know of sever conditions outside  Such as icy roads or extreme heat  There is also a rear control panel for the back seat passengers  It lets you control the heat  fan  and radio from the back seat  I think that this vehicle is perfect for everyone  Weather you are looking for a family car or a sporty little truck  you have found the perfect one
