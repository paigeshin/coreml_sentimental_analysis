 First I ll say this  The 1995  and  to some extent  the 96  Windstar SUCKED  reliability wise  The 95 model was the first model year  so it s sort of understandable  The 95 year had transmission problems and all sorts HOWEVER  The new vans are GREAT Several people I know have Windstars of various vintages  96  97  98  2000  Only the guy with the 96 has had problems My family has rented 3 Windstars  a 95  98  and 99  each for over a month  We used them for long drives  we went two days constantly on the highway and also around town  We ve been completely impressed with all of them  The interior is humungous  Every time we rented a Windstar  it was used to haul 6 people and luggage on long trips  No problem  Still comfy for everyone in the van  The only complaint was with the 1995 model   the air conditioning wasn t very good in the back bench  However  this was completely fixed in the 98 and 99 models we rented All the vans were very comfortable  and the sound systems were excellent  important if you are on long trips  They all had the 3 8L V6 and drove nicely  especially the 99  Absolutely nothing went wrong with any of them  including the 1995  and we were so impressed that we nearly bought one  we decided on a Focus  because we don t really  need  the extra space I highly reccommend the Ford Windstar  but only models from 1997 and on  This is the van for families Tips  Don t get a Windstar without the 3 8L V6 engine  The extra power is very nice  and the engine is smoother br br
