 I have been driving my 2000 Taurus for four months and have yet to have a single problem with the vehicle  I must admit that I did not buy or lease the car  My employer supplies me with a vehicle due to my line of work  Our company has been leasing the Taurus since 1997 and this is the best model year yet In the past we have had numerous problems with the front brakes and rotors  This problem area was most noticeable on the  98 and  99 models  My 2000 Taurus has 6000 miles on it and has shown no signs of any brake deficiencies  In the past we have had repeated problems with warped rotors and premature brake pad wear  When the local Ford Dealer told me that the problem had been corrected for 2000  I was skeptical  Now  I am a believer Additional improvements abound  My vehicle is the 4 Dr SES model with the OHV Vulcan V6  For 2000  the Vulcan s horsepower has been increased slightly and its NVH reduced  I have found these improvements to be noticeable  if not significant  The freshly restyled exterior and interior are also  subjectively  improvements over the old model  The visibility through the rear window is much better due to Ford  quot deep sixing quot  the oval rear window  The reduced blind spots are welcomed when trying to merge onto the freeways in Southern California  The quality of the interior materials is substantially better than in the past  There is no longer an abundance of cheap plastic on the door panels  center console and other areas  The interior is now much more mainstream  The oval dashboard has given way to a more traditional one which is slightly more ergonomic in design  Radio controls are grouped more logically and the auxilliary 12v power receptacle is now more accessible  My car is equipped with the full floor console with a floor mounted gear shift  In this configuration  Ford has designed a unique and very versatile cup holder  It can be adjusted to handle a beverage container of almost any size  This is particularly nice for those of us who spend hours stuck in traffic My model came equipped with a standard power driver s side seat  This is a nice feature on a car in this price range as it offers me an infinite number of seating positions  The seat also has an adjustable lumbar support which is handy on longer trips  The only aspect of the old Taurus seats that I liked better were their side bolsters  For 2000  the seats do not have nearly the lateral support that they did in  99  This is a small quibble considering the other improvements Interior details have also been attended to in the 2000 redesign  Effective map lights are well placed and easy to use  Split sun visors allow the driver and passenger to simultaneously cover the front and side windows  This is especially nice on those days when the sun cannot decide which window it wants to  quot attack quot  The visors also have nicely illuminated mirrors which were lacking from my last car I have been particularly impressed with the lower level of noise inside this year s model  While still not up to the Accord or Camry standard  it is still much improved from  98 and  99  The Vulcan V6 still roars when under heavy acceleration  However  now the roar is more muted The overall ride for 2000 is also enhanced from past years  A switch to 16 quot  tires and rims has certainly helped  Also  I have been told that Ford made a number of small suspension improvements to improve ride quality and responsiveness  I certainly have noticed the difference  The ride is still far from that of a touring car  but not at all unpleasant  When compared to my  98 Mazda Millenia  the Taurus falls short  However  I feel it is not that far off from  99 Honda Accords and Mazda 626 s I ve driven  It is certainly better than anything Ford has produced in the past in this class of vehicle I like the fact that Ford includes alloy wheels as standard equipment on the SES model  They add an upscale look to a  quot fleet quot  vehicle  Access to the trunk is also significantly better  as is the usable trunk space  The squaring off of the rear deck provided these improvements  Forward visibility is much better thanks to the redesigned headlights All in all  this is a very nice vehicle at a really great price point  In fact  I like it so much that I may end up buying a Taurus or Sable Wagon next year when I retire my old Volvo 740 Wagon br br
