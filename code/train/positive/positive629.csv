 This truck is an adventure every time that I step into it  First of all this is by far the larges vehicle that I ve been into  The triton V8 engine is so powerful I feel as if I could take on any other car or truck in a race  Outside if you like trucks  it s one of the most beautiful trucks I ve ever seen  The front foot room is large and would be big enough for a large sized man  In the back there is enough room for children or smaller adults  Overall this car is a great experience  the only disadvantage is parking this mammoth beast  Despite this fact I would recommend this car to anyone br br
