 Last spring we got a new car  a 1999 ford taurus  We are very happy with it  Why wouldn t we be We got a great deal from priceline com but the car is reliable  Before this taurus  we had a 1989 taurus for 10 years  older than our son  We NEVER had any major problems with it  Just a great  dependable car The taurus is roomy and a reliable car  And it is not very expensive  We usually never have to take it in for repairs  People compliment my husband on his lovely new car  why not  It is perfect I think anyone wanting to buy a new car should definetly go test drive a taurus  The people are friendly and helpful  but most importantly the car is great br br
