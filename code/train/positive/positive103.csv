 We recently bought a 2001 Ford Explorer  used with only 3500 miles on it  It has the leather package  AM FM CD and Cassette  upgraded speakers  and power everything  Yet after all this negative hype from the media  we still wanted to purchase it  We love it just as much we thought we would  Compared to the Chevy Blazer which we also test drove extensively  the Ford was the best bet for the money  Although we paid  3000 more than we would have paid for the Chevy  the Ford came with options that made it well worth it  The interior is very roomy  and since we re starting a family  we needed the back seat which ample adult seating and leg room  The leather makes it nice because it s easy to keep clean and since I m a little short  I can slide right in once I hop up high enough  It hardly feels  too big  to drive and it s very easy to park  I love it
