 I purchased this Ford Windstar in February 2001  I just put 34 500 miles on my 2001 Ford Windstar SEL after returning to Michigan from Florida  It s a very comfortable ride with an excellent suspension  high headroom  good legroom  well thought out ergonomic controls  front driver and passenger airbags and rear passenger side airbags  It has independent adjustable climate controls for the rear with a rear climate control shut off in the front control panel  It has power everything including two power sliding doors  8 way power driver s seat with power lumbar support  2 driver memory  power adjusting gas and brake pedals  and traction control  Other goodies include turn indicators on the outside rear view mirrors and warning lamps when one or both of the power sliding doors are activated  an electronic compass  external temperature read out  automatically dimming rear view mirror  trip timer  engine message center  and low tire inflation sensors  I did not opt for the entertainment package with the 5  LCD viewer and the VHS DVD player This van came with the keyless touchpad entry feature on the driver s side door  daytime running lamps  and quad seating with a third bench seat  The exterior color is a two toned with a deep  emerald green and lower gold accent trim  The interior is a dark parchment with cloth seats and wood accents trim  The only difference between this SEL and the Limited series were basically the solid paint schemes  leather  heated  seats and wood accented steering wheel Whereas Chrysler offers their minivans in two basic body styles a short and a long wheelbase  the Ford Windstar comes in the long wheelbase model only The Windstar has surprisingly quick acceleration  Maneuverability is so so with the long wheelbase  The ride is very comfortable and quiet  The van holds the road very well and handles wet  slippery roads easily with the long wheelbase and the traction control  entry and exit is very good  The engine is loud if you floor it  but under normal driving conditions  the van gives a fairly quiet ride The Windstar has many niceties including a small shelf to hold things like a cellular phone  a center console with cup holders and storage for CDs and cassettes  holders in the driver and passenger doors for maps and other stuff  and a pull out shelf with two more cup holders  The overhead console provides very good interior lighting  a mirror to watch the kids sitting behind you  a compartment for eyeglasses or keys  a coin holder  a holder for a remote  and  as a really nice touch  the top of the dash is textured to eliminate glare and reflections off the dash onto the windshield  An extra power outlet is in front by the passenger side and a rear power outlet is at the liftgate  the two middle seats have cup holders and the rear seats fold down for extra room for cargo  The two middle seats and the third bench seat are removable  The third seat has little hooks in the back to hook the handles of plastic grocery bags into to keep the bags from moving around and spilling their contents  I also received a cargo net for the rear to keep items from shifting  The built in Homelink remote on the driver s visor easily adapted to my garage door remotes  The visors have lighted mirrors  Interior cargo space is very good  allowing me to remove the back seat and put in several pieces of luggage  a bicycle  and scuba gear including two air tanks  I had to pack everything carefully  but it all fit nicely However  the third bench seat weighs approximately 70 pounds so it can be a two person job to take the third seat out and put it back in  Fuel economy is somewhat disappointing  My fuel economy with this Windstar averaged 24 6 MPG with 89 octane mid grade fuel  Economy is a little less at 23 8 MPG with premium 93 octane fuel  The Windstar s V 6 engine is more than adequate for mountainous driving  I was impressed with the van s performance on Interstate 40 driving through the Appalachians  Braking is adequate enough to quickly decelerate the 5 600 van  in my opinion  I m not a professional driver so I can t honestly evaluate  in technical terms  braking characteristics  The anti lock brakes do work and keeps the van under control and from skidding  When the anti lock brakes take over  you ll see the icon appear on the instrument cluster and the brake pedal will pulsate  You ll also hear an unsettling grinding or crunching noise  but this is normal  Also  when the front wheels start to spin and the traction control activates  the traction control icon appears on the instrument cluster and again  you ll hear that unsettling grinding or crunching noise  but again that is normal  the traction control can be manually disabled by the driver The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and unless you re looking for for it  you can hardly tell when the transmission shifts up or down  The transmission cannot be disengaged from Park until the brake pedal is depressed and held  The road noise is low inside the van The van seems to collect road grime  salt and slush on the rear window so I find myself using the rear wiper and washer frequently  This is my first van and I think this is inherent with all vans and SUVs A well equipped Windstar costs about as much as an upscale luxury sedan but is much more versatile while retaining many of the luxury features  I wish Ford would jazz up the pedestrian instrument layout and dash  I also noticed that water will fall on the door controls if the windows are cracked open while I am driving in rain  Overall  I m very satisfied with the Windstar  It has lived up to nearly all my expectations  except fuel economy  If Ford ever builds these Windstars with all wheel drive  then the Ford Explorer will be in very big trouble
