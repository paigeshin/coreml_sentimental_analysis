 I recently rented one of the new Ford replacement for the Escort  and lets just say that Ford is still making progress in their small car designs The Focus that I rented was a SE 4 door sedan that was heavily optioned  It did come equipped with the standard 2 0 liter engine that had been used in the Escort  Having owned a 94 Escort wagon with a manual transmission and over 175 000 trouble free mind  the Focus would be considered for a replacement Ford seems to have solved the noise and vibration problems that plagued the Escort  The Focus idles silently and smoothly without the rear view mirror shake that I have become accustomed to in my personal car  Although the engine now is rated at 110 horsepower  the low end torque of the engine is such that it seems more powerful than it really is  The seating position is higher than in the Escort and I found no real blind spots  Around town the power with the optional automatic transmission is ideal for city conditions  and is not bad on the highway either  as I had cruised at 85 mph and the vehicle tracked straight and true and was immune to cross winds  Compared to the 2001 Chevrolet that I had rented earlier in the year  the Focus was actually superior on the highway and the seating position lets one get a better focus on the road ahead of you  Handling and braking are very  very good  but gas mileage is lower than what the Escort could achieve  but is still over 30mpg on the highway But there is no such thing as a perfect car  despite what anyone thinks  The funky interior and exterior design takes some getting used to  and I guess that it would have to grow on you  The interior now places the stereo system above the heat and a c controls as opposed to the opposite in the old Escort  and that is a welcomed change as one generally will fiddle with the radio more than the climate control system  The optional CD player takes up a lot of real estate on the dash and the controls are somewhat confusing  The ash try is placed right behind the steering wheel and is difficult to find in the day and down right impossible to find at night  The cup holders are down really low and difficult to reach  I also don t like the self locking feature that causes the car to lock all the doors when one reaches about 10 mph  I am quite capable of locking the doors myself  thank you very much I would have to put this vehicle high on the list though of the best of the breed in the small car world  and considering that I have recently also driven a new Toyota Corrolla  to me the Toyota is hard to justify for  3000 more
