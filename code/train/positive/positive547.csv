 My F350 is a fine truck however having problems with Ford fixing two major problems  Problems are as follows 1  My truck is a early model  The air intake is in the fender well and I have a problem a loud sucking or as I call it a loud howling noise from that area  Ford s district mgr refuses to fix the problem  Dealers in other areas have solved this problem by rerouting the air intake to the front grille like the later Ford models and this does fix the problem  2  When I start the Powerstroke after setting for awhile I get a loud thump noise from under the hood  I continually complain about this but nothing seems to be done to fix it
