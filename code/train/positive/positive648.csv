 I ordered my ZX2 on Jan  22 before I read the opinions already written  I now have around 2 000 miles on it and I really like the car a lot I was ready to hate the car because it took 10 weeks from day of order to day of delivery  I was also prepared to be disappointed in the performance of the car because I read some of the negative comments on this page  Neither have been the case the car is a 4 speed with cruise control which works extremely well even on hills  I ve been driving small Fords since 1972 when I got a Pinto and have gone through the Pintos and the Escorts ever since  This car is as good or better than any of the others that we ve owned  It s fun to drive very comfortable for the two of us that own it and use it  It wouldn t be a good choice for a family only seats 4 but it does have a good sized trunk  My gas mileage is regularly in the 30 mph range  I do a lot of short trips and a few 100 mile trips and the mileage has been around 30 every time we ve filled it  I didn t get the cd in it  just the radio and cassette player so have no problem with a cd changer in the trunk  It does step right out when you want to go unlike some cars that take forever to reach the 65 speed limit on our expressways  The only problem I have at this time is that we can t find a good place to mount the  deer whistlers  that we put on all of our vehicles  I ended up paying a little under  14 000 for the car with cruise control  comfort group which included air conditioning  and the power package which gave me power windows  door locks and keyless entry  That was after a  1500  Ford rebate  I haven t even found any little things that require taking it back to the dealer like you usually do when you buy a new car  or used one for that matter
