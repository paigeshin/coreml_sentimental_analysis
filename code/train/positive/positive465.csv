 i first had a new ford expedition 3years ago 1997xtl silver i had never driven anything like it before  it handled and rode like large car and not a big truck  but the biggest surprise came on december day with the first light snow with five o clock traffic when a little white car slid in front of me from the second lane on an exit ramp leading to another superhighway  With no space to stop  and not wanting to squash the smaller car to pieces  I swerved with complete control to a small space between the end of the lane I was in and guard rail to keep vehicles from falling down an incline  In a split second I was around the white car  proceeding in front of it on a curve toward the superhighway  I never lost control and everything about the Expedition responded better than any vehicle I have ever been in  It truly saved my life and the life of the driver of the white car  I drove that same Expediton for two years and 30 000 miles  It went through snow  ice  off terrain encounters and was finally turned back in two years later  I immediately went out and purchased a new 1999 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition and found the same type of feeling of security and the fantastic ability to see around everything else  and have heard a number of stories of expeditions that have survived tremendous crashes with the occupants able to walk away  One other special is it comes equipped with a fantastic cd radio cassette system  it s truly a fantastic vehicle br br
