 Boy  how I hated Fords  At the time I was buying my Thunderbird  I thought it would be the perfect vehicle  I was dead wrong  There was more wrong with this car than right and Ford couldn t seem to find and fix all the problems that existed with this monster We decided to trade it in and buy something new  My  die hard Ford loving  husband wanted a Ford  I wanted something that didn t spend more time in the shop than on the road  Since he owned a Ford truck that required little maintenance  took him to and from work for the past 7 years and had well over 100 000 miles on it  I figured a truck might be the way to go  Ford seemed to make better trucks than cars We began looking at various  trucks  and SUVs  Actually  at that time  our SUV was considered to be a  truck  So much for a name  Anyway  at a local Ford dealer  we spotted a very handsome  SUV  called the  Explorer XLT with 4 wheel drive   Living on Long Island  NY  with a married daughter in the hills of Connecticut  we realized 4 wheel drive was necessary What first attracted me to the Ford Explorer was its looks  I wanted a mid sized  truck  that didn t have the spare tire hanging on the way of the back hatch  Neither did I want something that looked like an over sized station wagon  Seeing the Explorer  I took it for a test drive  I was immediately impressed on its easy handling  Although I had been driving a small Miata  and sometimes the Thunderbird when it wasn t in the shop  the larger vehicle was just as easy to maneuver through heavy traffic  There was no effort at all in fitting into tight parking spots and the mirrors located on each front side door  along with the rearview mirror  makes spotting any surrounding vehicles a piece of cake  My Explorer has  electronic seats  which makes it easier to position for either my husband or myself  Just one press of the button will easily bring you forward or back  Put the button up and the seat rises up  for those people like me who like to sit higher in the seat  Push that same button down  and the seat lowers  for those taller people who need the extra head room  The  lumbar pillow  is adjustable by pressing another button located directly above the seat positioning button  When the lumbar pillow is inflated  it definitely comes in handy to relieve the pressure off my back and make the ride so much more comfortable  Since the  back seat fold down individually   it s most convenient when company comes to visit and we load the back with supplies  This way  should you only have one back seat passenger but a whole lot of items to carry  you can lower only the one seat and your passenger can sit comfortably and enjoy the ride b And speaking of the back b  there is more room than we know what to do with   which  now that we live in Florida  comes in handy for our trips to the north at Christmas  and the addition of so many grandchildren who love toys  My Explorer came with a  4 0 EFI  Fuel Injected  Catalyst  V6 Engine   After all these years  the pick up this engine emits is awesome  Whether doing the  unbearable  30 mph here in my small town of PGI or the  more enjoyable  80 mph on I 75  on our trips north  the engine has never failed to give its best  never once hesitating or failing in any way Our model is equipped with a  5 speed O D Automatic transmission   In addition to the  driver and passenger airbags   the other safety feature I like best is the  4 wheel anti lock brake system  and side door guard beams  For those who have children  or visiting grandchildren  you ll enjoy the  standard child proof rear door locks   In other words  the doors will NOT open from the inside  However  these locks CAN be turned off for the comfort of adults sitting in the rear Another part of my Explorer s standard equipment is the very functional  4 wheel drive CONTROL TRAC drive  electric shift transfer case and rack   pinion steering b In addition to it s  independent front suspension  all four wheels have powered disc brakes  While there are just so many other little things that make this vehicle a dream to own and drive  the most important is that I ve found it to be almost maintenance free  With the exception of periodic oil changes  and finally tire changes  we have had to do nothing else   not even a brake change   yet This SUV  truck  has certainly changed my mind about Fords  Would I buy another FORD  As long as I can have another EXPLORER I think the Ford Explorer is a great car for active people who are looking for something large enough to store and haul equipment and yet  want the maneuverability of a small car  The Explorer offers both  I ve had my Explorer for over five years and have found nothing to dislike about it  In fact  we praised our Explorer so much  that when our friends needed a new car  they went directly to a Ford Dealership and bought the sports model of the Explorer  which is a bit smaller than ours  but suits them fine  But that s their story
