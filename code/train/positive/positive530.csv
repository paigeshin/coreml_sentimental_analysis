 This product has proven completely reliable  comfortable and utilitarian  and I highly recommend an Explorer for a family or adventurer  Either the V 8 power or the V 6 is great  I ve had both  and the V 8 has full time all wheel drive  which is helpful for those of us who commute in snowy climates  It s a strong engine which warms up quickly and started yesterday after sitting in a parking lot for 60 hours in five degree temperatures The creature comforts  like heated leather seats  are wonderful and make for comfortable driving trips  The rear seats fold easily and cargo is protected by an easily removable cargo cover  Driving position is comfortable for my 6 3 quot  frame and also for my smaller friends I haul all sorts of things  and pull a three place snowmobile trailer  with sleds  with no problem I highly recommend the Explorer for the demanding consumer who wants a long term reliable vehicle br br
