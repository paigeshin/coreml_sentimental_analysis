 This is a wonderful car  I bought mine as a used car and it was still in wonderful shape it has way over 100 thousand miles on it and it still runs like a dream  This car doesn t require much maintnence  Does good on gas  and oil  Has good  quot get up and go quot    runs smoothly when going down the road at any speed  This is a must buy car  If you are looking for a good car choose this one it also has plenty of space in front and back seats  Most have options such as power seats  power windows power steering and more I really can think of nothing negative about this car  I really enjoy it  Parts are easy to get at any car parts place  also parts are not very expensive to aquire br br
