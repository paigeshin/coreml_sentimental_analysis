 I am not first in line to bash American vehicles and I am also not a Ford disciple  which means I am able to remain objective about this car  My feeling is that this isn t that bad of a car  yet not great  I purchased my Taurus GL used in 2001 with 70K miles and it now is at 130K There are a few things that bother me about the car  but the transmission has always been my greatest concern  Not long after I purchased the car there was a strange hiccup while driving that seemed to happen after longer trips  I never determined what caused it although it hasn t happened for a long time  It could actually have been the brakes which I replaced  although it felt like it was in the transmission  More recently  I had a very strange problem with my transmission which started with alternator and power steering problems  Both would malfunction while driving  which later I found was caused by some kind of transmission sensor module  I later found out that if you don t fix it immediately  it really messes up your overdrive  which is what I am experiencing now I would say the other problems with the car are more annoying than major  The interior lights have a tendency to stay on after you shut the door  which I solved by pulling out the bulbs  The interior in my car is cheap and the rear window is hard to clean because of its oddball shape  Also on a more personal note  the person who owned the car prior to me burned holes in the interior and stunk up the car with their smoking habit  I still cannot get all of the smell out  which annoys me  On the good side  the V 6  3 0 liter Ford standby has been a good performer I used semi synthetic oil in it  which may or may not help  If not for the transmission I would be more than happy with the car  adding that Scosche sells kits for getting rid of the stupid stereo console  It is what many people call a  grandpa car  but if you are not vain about those things it is not a bad car  If you are mindful of the transmission problems and take steps to prevent the problems  it could be a good deal used
