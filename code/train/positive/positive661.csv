 In June of 2000  my 1989 Mercury Tracer finally kicked the bucket  That was a two door coupe which was basically a big  red  problem  So off I went  carshopping with my father  I trust his opinion  and knew he d help me choose a good car   Besides  I had learned the hard way that car salesmen ignore solitary women I shopped alone  read  Consumer Reports  faithfully and followed their Reliability Charts on used cars  I noted that the Escort s reliability had improved drastically over the past ten years  I began looking toward an Escort being an economical solution to my dilemma  And then  tired of being ignored and treated like a  stupid woman  by salesmen  I asked my dad to go with me We chose the 1999 Ford Escort SE  in silver  And I cannot say enough good things about it  I adore it  My son  who is 2  still refers to it as  Mommy s New Car  even though I ve had it for nearly seven months now  The four door Escort is a practical family car  for me with just one child  which gets excellent gas mileage  I have had no major problems with it  and no costs except gas and oil changes  Oh  wait  I did have  one  cost  I had one flat tire  due to the fact that there is always construction going on  and almost always near someplace I need to be  I have only had one minor problem with the tape player  Yes  I said tape player  The car was  and still is  under factory warranty  so off I went back to the dealers  to get it fixed  And I was an even happier camper The only drawback to the Escort lies not with the car  but with me  I am not used to owning a car as new as this one  so I am sure the salesman who helped me as well as the automotive department is probably tired of seeing me  Every little noise  and back I went  I was fearful of something major going wrong  as it had with my Tracer  Nothing is wrong with the car  I was  and still am  a paranoid new car owner
