 History  I purchased this automobile at 6K and have driven it on paved to gravel roads  Most of the miles on this car have been highway  I have replaced two unrelated engine sensors in the 60K I have driven it  These two sensors were backed up in the programming and did not disable the car before I took it to the shop  Look and Feel  This automobile is more stylish than the GM equivalents that I was comparing it to at the time  update your car interiors GM  and I have not been too impressed with my previous ownership encounters of Dodge and Chrysler products  Has a smooth ride and handles good for a larger car  It is very comfortable and it didn t feel like I was riding on the ground like some of the Honda  Subaru  or sporty autos  Economy  The car averages 23 25 MPG on the highway  but does prefer the higher octane 89 and can ping under load on hills when driving slow back roads using 87 octane  Body Integrity  Body is still in great shape and the paint still has a good finish  Wiper arms were frozen one winter and were a problem  The wiper bolt will not keep arm fixed on the shaft  This part has aluminum splines and sheered off never to work properly again without modification or replacement  Final Comments  It has made for some comfortable 10 hour trips for four people numerous times  However the weight of the full trunk of luggage and the two people  small people in the back seat is a bit too much for the rear suspension  On some sharp quick inclines the car bottoms out on the springs and is that is not very comforting Recommendation  I will buy this auto in the future when I need another 4 door sedan br br
