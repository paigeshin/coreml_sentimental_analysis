 I love Escorts  I think they re great I owned this European 1 6 S model for about 6 months and had a few problems The main problem in mine was the fuse box  Its a really common problem and was why the escort was considered unreliable I know enough about cars to change it myself  but it took a long time and a scrap box cost me  30  45  This may not be too much but if you got the Ford dealer to do it for you  it would cost  200   labour  You would be looking at over  400  600 Each escort model has a different fuse box  so finding the correct scrap one was hard The other problem with Escorts is the locks and alarm system  The barrels wear out very easily although if you know how to dismantle a door panel and remove the lock  the dealer only charges a small amount to change the barrels for you  The alarm is another problem  on other European Fords as well  If you lock the door from the passenger side and then unlock the door from the driver side  the alarm will go off  It is caused by a faulty electrical part on either the drivers or passenger side door locks  or both  It can be fixed but the parts will probably break again  Check this if you are buying one and use it to knock the price down Also check ALL electrics  Check the heater  inside fan  engine fan  and electric windows and anything else you can think of  I would not recommend buying a GHIA model or high spec model with a lot of electric parts  as there is to much room for error The main fuse blew on several occasions Other than this  i found the car nice to look at  nice do drive  and the handling was good as well  Seats were a little uncomfortable on long journeys though  Mechanically they are actually very good and the engine problems that occured were purely electricaly related Check the exhaust for rust on the back box though as they do not last very long The engine was the same model as the ones used previously in the 1984 91 model and so are not advanced and can be very noisy if worn  Listen to the tappets  If they are very noisy and the car claims to have done 30 000 miles  then it is more likely to be 130 000 The noises can start from 60 000 miles onwards depending on use  People try crafty methods such as using thick oil  or if the oil is not clean  then this will also dampen the noise  find out what oil was used Don t be put off by this  If the car is clean with a full history  and is quiet ish  then if the price is right  buy it  All electrical problems can be fixed very cheaply if you do it by yourself  You may never even experience any problems  but be aware of them and carry spare main and regular fuses at all time Conclusion Popular car and good value for money  Cheap spares availiable  never go to the dealers br br
