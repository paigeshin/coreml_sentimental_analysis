 I ve been a proud owner of a 1966 Mustang convertible for five years  It is one of the best cars I have ever driven  I recently watched a TV program where they investigated the exploding gas tanks in 1960 s mustangs  I think it is not as big of a deal as they make it out to be  In this TV report  they blamed Ford Motor Company for the deaths of several teen age mustang drivers  In these accidents  when the mustangs were rear ended  the gas tanks were punctured causing gas to get all over the driver and burn them  The gas entered the car because of the fold down back seat  I know that in my convertible  there is no possible way for anything to get from the trunk to the back seat  Only fastbacks have this fold down seat  Ford shouldn t be blamed for any of this  If you own a car from the 1960 s you should know that it isn t going to be that safe  When compared with other old car problems  this seems to be very small  I suggest that if you do own a 60 s mustang with this problem you buy a metal barrier so that gas cannot enter the car  You can get one in any mustang restoration catalog for about  200  It is a very good investment to make  If you own an old car  you should be responsible and make sure it is safe  Classic mustangs are the best cars ever and they don t need a minor flaw like this messing up their reputation
