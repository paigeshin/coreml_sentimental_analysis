 This car is FABULOUS  I can t stop raving about it  It is perfect for new parents  The four years that my husband and I have been married  we have driven a small compact car  When we found out we were expecting our first baby  we knew that we needed a new car with more room  I began having night mares of being a mini  van girl  and when I thought about getting a wagon  all I could think about was the Big green Brady Bunch Goose  I knew I had to make some changes in my life   now that I was going to be a mommy  but I wasn t prepared for the vehicle change  Praise the Lord  we came across the 1995 Ford Escort LX wagon  It is small and sleek enough to be simi  cool  and yet big enough to provide the much needed extra space  I love it  It gets great gas mileage and is so easy to handle  The heating and air systems are outstanding  It s great for the long trips back to my parents as well as the running around in town  This car is prefect for small families  especially new ones who are not ready for the mini van  but need more room than what a small car can offer br br
