 I have to say that the Ranger is possibly the best purchase I ever made  And I also have to say it was one of the safest I ever made  I had a 1995 Ranger XLT  And unfortunately I wrecked it  It was a nasty accident  but I came out with only a scratch  So it gets my vote for safety I loved the truck because  though it was small  it served it s purpose well  and was NEVER in the shop  It was incredibly reliable  The 2 3L  4 cylinder  was a little under powered  though it got good gas mileage  The best I ever got was 33 mpg  I had an aftermarket exhaust on it  and I removed the intake silencers  which helped both power  and mileage  The 33 mpg was steady driving at 55  I ve heard that s a little rare  but if you don t mind going a little slower  and are gentle with the throttle  it s not out of the question The only thing I didn t like about the truck was the small cab  An extended cab would have solved this easily  The long bed would have been a little better for hauling  too  But with the standard cab  and short bed  I kept the weight down  which helps mileage  and helps the 4 cylinder get going a little better I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a truck  They re stout  and are VERY reliable
