 We traded in our Saturn sedan for a Ford Taurus because we needed more space for our baby  The Taurus is an excellent family car with plenty of room inside and in the trunk  So far we have had no major engine or system trouble and we ve had the Taurus for 2 years  The air conditioning and heating provide excellent climate control and the stock stereo is good for everyday listening The brakes ignition switch has come unconnected twice since we ve had the car and has had to be pushed back in by hand  There isn t a lot of leg room in the back seat for passengers with long legs
