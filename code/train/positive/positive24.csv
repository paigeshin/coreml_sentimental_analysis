 We bought our used 1994 Econoline E150 Mark III Conversion van in 1998 from friends who didn t need the large van anymore  It had 49 000 miles on it and was in good shape inside  We have thoroughly enjoyed the van for the last two years  You can t beat it for long trips  You don t arrive at your destination feeling beat up  My kids enjoy watching movies or just being able to stretch out in all that space My concerns have only just now begun  Our ABS light on the dashboard started appearing randomly shortly after we purchased the van  When we checked with the Midas place locally about it  they said it was okay to drive  the regular brakes would always be available and they couldn t check it unless the light was actually on  Well it always goes off when the van is turned off and of course never comes on when we are close to a place that can check it  So that has been an ongoing concern  We still don t know what is wrong there Now recently on a trip  of course  the  quot OFF quot  button on the overdrive control started flashing indicating that something was going on with the transmission  Luckily we found an AAMCO place that was willing to take us and check it immediately  They explained that the transmission clutch was starting to slip and reset the button so that it wouldn t be flashing on our trip home  They told us that we could continue to drive it  don t push it by running on cruise control  and sometime the light would come on again  indicating problems again  but when that would be would be anybody s guess  Well of course  to fix it would entail big bucks The bottom line is that we are now babying the van  trying to decide if we want to fix all the problems or buy a new one  Yes we would buy a new one if we could afford it  They are wonderful vehicles and a joy to drive  Once you get used to driving the size  you ll never go back to small cars  The entertainment for the kids on long trips is priceless  No more  are we there yet  or how much longer  I d recommend them to anyone in a second  and I have Just as an update  It is now August 2000 and two things have changed  We did finally get to Midas and have them check out the brake light  They went over it thoroughly  and didn t charge us by the way  and couldn t find anything wrong with the brakes  The manager there told us that this is common in these vans and is probably an electrical short which they couldn t fix  Kudos to Midas Second  the transmission light came on again as we were going on vacation  Finally decided to suck it up and take it to a local nonchain transmission shop owned by an friend  He checked it over thoroughly  again for no charge  and said he wouldn t be driving the thing much longer if it was him  Right now  as we speak  it is in the garage having the transmission replaced  Looks like I ll be driving this one a few more years br br
