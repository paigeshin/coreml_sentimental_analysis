 While definitely not the most glamorous car to drive  the Taurus wagon is an efficient  quot soccer mom quot  car  After owning the old Taurus wagon model for a few years and having some problems I decided to trade it in for the  99 model and I m very glad I did  Driving this car is a very pleasant experience  I have had no trouble with brakes  acceleration  or  unlike with the old model  the air conditioner heat  The driver s seat adjusts in many ways so that I can be comfortable when I drive and stay alert  Even though there have been minor incidents in which this car has gotten roughed up  the only injury was done to the exterior appearance of the car  Even though I ve only owned this car for about a year  I am still happy with the fact that I have not had reason to bring it in for any repairs  After owning the previous Taurus wagon model and a Volvo wagon  I m glad to say that this is the best station wagon that I ve come across br br
