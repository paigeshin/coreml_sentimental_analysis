 95  of my Escort experience has been extremely positive  I own a red 1990 Ford Escort LX  four door hatchback  to be precise  We only paid  200 because my dad knew the guy he bought it from  my Escort is easily worth  700 800  I love my Escort  with these gas prices  a car that gets 30 to 33 miles per gallon is always good  and you can take them anywhere  interstate  city  dirt roads  etc  I take my escort up over the mountain and down a dirt road a couple times each week when I go to work the gelding I m showing in 4 H this year  and it does fine  It fights a little going up hill  but any four banger is going to do that  The biggest problem I have with my Escort is that it doesn t always start  this doesn t happen as often to me as it does to my cousin  who has 1989 Ford Escort LX  but my uncle and grandfather devised a way to start them with a screwdriver  I d have to get all technical about under the hood stuff that I don t know a whole lot about  and all s good there All in all  a great little car  It gets you where you need to go  And this car has so much character  You will not find a car with more character than an Escort  I promise you that
