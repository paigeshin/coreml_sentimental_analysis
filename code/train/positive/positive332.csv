 I discovered yesterday that it would be cheaper for me to rent a car than it would be to take a taxi or shuttle to get home So  I called Hertz and said  quot I want the cheapest car I can get quot They set me up in a Champagne colored Ford Escort  A rather nice looking vehicle  For day to day use  I like larger cars  like my Dodge Intrepid  But I simply needed to get from point A to point B  and then briefly to point C to drop the car off  so I wanted something with four wheels and an engine If Hertz s cheapest car is the Ford Escort  anyone who pays for an upgrade is just throwing away money In a hurry  we threw all the suitcases in the back seat of the car  It looked like it had decent legroom  I got into the car and immediately noticed how it different from other rentals I ve had  several  98 and  99 Chevrolet Cavaliers and a 1998 Ford Escort   Disclaimer  I ve also rented a 1999 Jeep Wrangler  but these are for two different types of uses The 2000 Ford Escort looks and feels nice inside  The steering wheel is pretty thick  My Dodge s is a little thicker  but it s still formidable  The window and lock controls are firm and sturdy  the gear shifter well made and sturdy in your hand   The other rentals felt plasticky with snap together pieces that didn t always fit well All of the climate and radio controls are easily reachable by both the driver and passenger  The radio sounds clear and the air conditioner blasts cold air pretty well  What s really cool is that the radio displays the time  and  the radio station at the same time  No having to push buttons back and forth  The seats are comfortable and you have a good view of the road  The rear columns are thin  meaning less blind spots  The windows go up and down quickly and quietly   But  you probably want to know  how does it drive b This is where the 2000 Ford Escort impressed me the most  The car handles very well  Its steering is crisp and its acceleration is amazing  I m used to a much heavier car and I was incredibly surprised at how quickly this car accelerated  It cruised well at 75 and is a very quiet car  inside  The engine noise is very muted  It also breaks quickly If I were still in college and had had a chance to drive this car  I would have wanted one br br
