 I have owned my Ford Econoline full size van  with Regency custom conversion for just over a year now  I love the van  It is such a comfortable ride compared to the other large vehicles on the market  like an Expedition or Suburban  because it isn t built on a truck frame  However  I have to say that dealing with the conversion people is like pulling teeth  Because all of the interior parts are considered part of the conversion  I have to wait for EVERY part to be ordered   even the seatbelts  which had dried glue on them  And any electrical problem is automatically blamed on the conversion people  The ground wire to the drivers side lighted vanity mirror was loose  so the light only worked intermittently  and it took several tries for them to finally get it right because they just kept trying to replace the part  not find the root of the problem  I realize that parts of this problem lies with the dealership  but they are the only Regency approved dealer in my area  so I am forced to use them instead of an alternate Ford Dealer br br
