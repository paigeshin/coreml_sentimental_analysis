 I purchased a 1989 Ford Taurus a few years back and was impressed with the ride and comfort coupled with it s gas mileage  I was a little disappointed with the power thus decided to make that a priority with my next automobile  When I decided to sell  I purchased a 1995 Taurus GL to take it s place  The GL is obviously of better quality than the plain one  Both automobiles were are top performers  The power and performances of this type of automobile  along with it s durability and low maintenance is tops  This automobile can certainly take what is dished out  Excellent quality and exquisite ride make this a most desireable car  I prefer the body style and unique design of the  95 model over today s version  I prefer the unique designs that set apart from the obvious  When design unites with quality performance then that is one unique drive  The sport design catches the attention of the youth in all of us  yet the roominess and comfort interests the adult in us  And the quality and durability satisfies all The Ford Taurus has been first on the race track until Nascar made them slow it down where the other cars could keep up  They ve slowed it down six miles an hour  This is one top performing automobile br br
