 We purchased a Ford Escort wagon brand new in 1998  It was very economical  and although I was not ready for the  quot Wagon quot  my two kids and a dog were  With soccer  baseball  volleyball and choir practice  I needed a car that I could fill with kids and or equipment and still save money on gas  This car gets great gas milage  I have safety locks on the back doors so the kids cant roll out into the street and a pull over shade  to hide anything in the hatch from the sun or would be theifs  I have yet to have a breakdown except when I ran out of gas LOL  and other than a problem with the ghost in the dome light  this has been a great family car  I did have the dome light replaced  only to continue having the problem of it coming on sporatically  Now I have it turned off entirely  With that one problem  I feel I am doing pretty well  this car has been a wonderful car for a family that couldnt afford a luxury car  The ride is smooth and seating is plenty  Good mid income family value br br
