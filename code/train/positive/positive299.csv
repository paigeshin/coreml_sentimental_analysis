 We ve had our 2000 Windstar SEL since July 2000  It s a much nicer  more refined vehicle than our previous Chevrolet Astro and Plymouth Voyager  Here are the things we like best about our Windstar  The ride is very comfortable  The interior is very comfortable  The controls are laid out logically  the rear ventilation system works great  the seats are relatively comfortable  and the power side doors work perfectly  The styling is gorgeous  Even though the Windstar design is getting a little old  it s still the most distinctive  beautiful minivan on the road  Safety  Five stars  Front and side airbags  Reverse sensing system  Anti lock brakes  Traction control  Conveniences  like cup holders  rear passenger ventilation system controls  power side doors  and the entertainment system  They all work great Concerns  Long term reliability  So far  we ve had the van into the dealer for 3 minor recall issues  replacement of the intake manifold  replacement of the front disc brake rotors  and replacement of a front seat belt buckle to repair the malfunctioning seat belt warning system  These are relatively minor issues  but I am concerned about long term reliability because we plan on keeping this van for many years  Leg room for rear seat passengers is extremely limited  Our sons are 15 and 12 and sometimes groan when they re relegated to the back seat As I said  this is our third minivan  Our kids are 8  12  and 15 and we ve worn out a Chevy Astro and Plymouth Grand Voyager through the years  By far  the Windstar is the most comfortable  user friendly minivan we ve owned  It s holding up well to kid abuse and the normal wear and tear of daily life  The reliability issues concern us a little  but it looks like we have the bugs worked out now  We re looking forward to many years with our Windstar  It s too bad  however  that this will likely be our last minivan  By the time we wear this one out  our 2 older kids will be off to college and all we ll need is a car  That ll be a switch I d recommend the Windstar to anyone  It s relatively spacious  comfortable  safe  fun to drive  and a good value
