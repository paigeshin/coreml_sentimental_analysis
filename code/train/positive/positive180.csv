 My ford thunderbird was first car  After a long and dissapointing venture for a used car i finally found my T Bird  At First I looked at a Dodge Neon  yuck  Then a 96  pontiac sunfire  but when i made the trip to Greenbrook to the dealer it suddenly sold and The salesman tryed to convince me I wanted a 98 Neon for  11 000 NOPE When i arrived home my mom was on the phone with my cousin how knew the owner of new dealer and they had a 1994 Ford Thunderbird  The next day I went to see after school  I LOVED IT  I bought it one the spot  PROS The car has great acceleration that never dissapoints me  It is a sports car with luxury  which is what i really love  When i want a sporty looking car its there and when i needed a car to look nice in for the Prom   my Thunderbird Was Perfect  The Front seats are roomy especially the passanger seat  my cousin with a broken leg had plenty of room with her leg straight out  The back is very large and comfortable  i have contemplated sleeping in the car already Though the leg room could be better for such a long car I love the fact that I can set the temp I want in the car  CONS The only thing I wasn t crazy about was the fact that you don t have a vent button its either windows   air  or heat This car keeps me in high Status with friends
