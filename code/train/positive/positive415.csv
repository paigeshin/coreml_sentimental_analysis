  The Paparazzi  They re ALWAYS causin  problems b Much press has been given to the newly styled  1999 Mustang GT  and  Mustang SVT Cobra   both good and bad  We were originally attracted to the Mustang GT for its power and speed  but had never considered purchasing one until the 99 model year   the new styling  with it s crisper lines and more powerful engine were all we needed to fall in love with not just ONE but TWO Ponycars  As the proud owners of both a 99 GT and 99 Cobra we tend to disagree with much of the negative attention surrounding the Cobra and the rumored   performance inadequacies i b Let s clear up a few misconceptions b For starters  these problems did NOT plague all 1999 SVT s  Ford elected to perform these  Horsepower Upgrades  on a voluntary basis  as a response to SOME dissatisfied SVT owners  Fortunately  some Cobras managed to come off the lot in prime condition   and with the upgrades to the fuel chip  intake and exhaust system  WOW  While my GT boasts a respectable 260hp  and even though it s equipped with an automatic transmission  can easily hit the 60 mark in the advertised time  it pales in comparison to the gut wrenching power and sheer G force put out by the Cobra  Even prior to the upgrade  the Cobra was on par with both the Corvette and Camaro SS  although the advertised 0 60 times on these are slightly lower than that of the Cobra  Our Cobra was even fortunate enough to leave in it s wake a highly supercharged Supra equipped with Nitrous b Clutch in  let up on the Or was it b Driving the Cobra requires a complete re education in shifting and cornering  Most day to day driving will find you in 3rd or 4th gear  reserving 5th for only the highest of freeway speeds  You will immediately feel its power as you squeal off the line in first gear  But even more impressive is the monstrous pull of  SECOND  gear  and this is where you will gain your greatest acceleration  Third is nearly as powerful  and quite often you may find that you  bark  the tires when speedshifting from 2nd to 3rd  Drivers may at first be startled by the subtle lift of the front end of the car when accelerating suddenly b How ya like my  curves i b The handling and suspension are sheer perfection  The independent rear suspension allows you to take ramps  hills and curves at full speed with no lean or instability   no turn is too sharp for this snake  Shifting is crisp and quick  and with each successive gear  you ll feel all 320 of those horses just bucking to be set free  We had been advised that it would be possible to lower the suspension up to 3 inches  but have found this will not be necessary   the slightly higher stance gives the driver an excellent command of the road without sacrificing handling capabilities in the least b Fits you like a glove b The front seats are form fitting and highly supportive  even on long roadtrips  and front seat passengers can enjoy oodles of legroom  Backseats are comfortable  however rear legroom is limited  But let s face it   this is a sports car  not a minivan  The Mach 460 Soundsystem produces excellent  clear sound  though you may want to crank it in order to hear it over the roar of the V 8  The Cobra and the GT are pure driving enjoyment  both in daily traffic and on weekend excursions  The slightly crowded backseat and limited trunkspace are hardly worth mentioning when compared to the overall perfection of these performance machines b Author s note  Beware of Lot Lizards b One thing to keep in mind when purchasing a Cobra is that due to the limited release  only 3 500 per model year will be produced  some dealerships will try to impose a surcharge of over  6 000  DON T PAY IT  When the first dealership tried to sell us this car at close to  35 000  we walked  They attempted to convince us that it was FORD  not the dealership  that was imposing this fee   they called it a  Limited Release Surcharge  Upon investigation  we found that another local dealer also had one Cobra on it s lot  and they were in fact NOT overcharging  So stand your ground and don t let them fool you  A fully equipped Cobra hardtop should run you in the neighborhood of  28 29 000 b The final word b Last but not least  there is one positive result of all of the negative press surrounding the performance   you will find that other drivers  particularly those in other sports cars  may underestimate the power of your car  Just be sure to wave and smile as you leave them behind b Author s Addendum  September 28  2000  Our Cobra is a 1999  and despite what some people think  there  were  no 2000 Cobras  This has made the 1999 s even more sought after  at least down here in Florida  where it seems there are more Mustangs per capita than anywhere else in the U S  Some dealers still have a few left on the lot  and I ve seen price gouging even worse than 16 months ago when we purchased ours  But if you can get your hands on one  I d highly recommend it br br
