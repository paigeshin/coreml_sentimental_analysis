 When I buy a vehicle  I start with the purpose I want it to fulfill  then I look for vehicles that can handle the intended uses at a reasonable price and in a reliable manner  I wanted a vehicle that could carry a fair amount of cargo in an enclosed space  could handle deep snow and slippery roads  and could tow a trailer or boat  I looked at the Grand Cherokee  4runner  Montero Sport  and Explorer as well as reading about others  The Explorer had the most space  a convenient 4wd system  good towing capacity  a proven reputation  and the best pricing  When a dealership offered me  1000 below invoice in an honest upfront manner  with 0 9  financing  that closed the deal One year and 17 000 miles later  I am still pleased  And my wife enjoys driving it also  It is a truck  but a very refined and well equipped truck  We have an XLT with 4 0 SOHC engine and moonroof  I live close to the Canadian border  It starts fine in  20 degrees  it drives well on unplowed snowy roads  and the anti lock braking system works as designed  Driver visibility and maneuverability are excellent  better than I expected in an SUV  We can easily carry groceries  pets  lumber  up to 11  sports equipment or whatever inside with plenty of space  We have towed heavy trailers for about 1500 miles during the past year at highway speeds with absolutely no problems  Thus  it has fulfilled our purposes We have had no mechanical problems  only normal maintenance  Gas mileage has been 15 19 mpg  which is not good but about what most equivalent SUVs also register  My only complaint has been that it is difficult to keep the underside of the vehicle clean during winter when snow  mud and salt splatter up underneath it  There are many irregular spaces between parts and panels where crud can get lodged  rust and corrosion would be expected to result  Thus  I spray it clean often during such weather  The spare tire is also exposed underneath SUVs do not get as good gas mileage and cannot handle emergency maneuvers  i e  rollover avoidance  like a sedan  Thus  they would not be my choice for a crowded commuter expressway  The Explorer is not highly rated as an offroad vehicle  other SUVs with a shorter wheelbase and more ground clearance may be better  But  if your purposes are similar to mine  the Explorer would be a good choice to look at
