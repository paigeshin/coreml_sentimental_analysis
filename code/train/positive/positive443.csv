 Let me say first  that our family already owns a 1996 Ford Taurus Wagon  We liked the wagon  and decided to look into another Ford this year  This year we decided again to go with a Ford  We purchased an SEL which is Ford s top of the line Taurus  We got the following options  Side air bags Dual electric seat adjustment  adjusts height and distance from dash Six CD device in trunk Traction control Leather seats  a Ford promo that was free We liked the SEL model because it has a stronger engine  Our 1996 wagon didn t have the best pick up  I love the way the car controls the interior temperature  You dial up the temperature via a thermostatic mechanism like your house  In the winter  when you want to heat the car  the car knows to blow the cold air though the vents by the windshield until the air heats up  Then it automatically shoots the air through whichever vents you ve chosen  I also like that that the outside temperature is displayed I like the center compartment between the driver and passenger  The cup holders have been improved and work better than on the 1996 wagon we have  It is nice also that in the back seat there is an arm rest in the middle  I have two children and now they know where their side of the seat ends I LOVE LOVE LOVE the keyless entry system  There is a control button to pop the trunk which is great during shopping sprees  Also  if you can t find the car in the parking lot  you can make the horn beep or pop the trunk to find it  There is a lot of trunk space and you can push the back seats down to get more space via the trunk  I like the  net  they provide which can hold groceries in the trunk without having them spill out of the bag The only minor problem with the car is that it doesn t have the best gas mileage  I can t remember exactly what we get gallon  but it will say on the sticker Be sure to do your homework  There are a lot of internet sites that list what the dealer s cost is  Know it before going in  We paid  200 over invoice
