 I am very impressed with this large people hauler  The overall quality of this vehicle seems to be higher than what I have seen on GM and DC vans  First impressions  I knew at first these were large vehicles  I also knew that I would be hauling around 14 passengers  Scary thought at first  especially since I had never before had the chance to drive an extended version of the club wagon  Overall  I have to admit once I began driving this vehicle I fell in love with it  The interior of the van was rather quiet considering there were about a dozen people conversing  The ride was very smooth over all pavement except for on grooved pavement  Handling was good and the van seemed to hold to curves very well considering it s size  City driving also wasn t very hard  Only caution I have is to not cut your right turns to close or you ll go for a joy ride over the curb  Now that I have driven one and am a college student who hauls around a lot of stuff and people I am looking to purchase one of my own within the next year and a half  Why get one  Good towing capacity  hauling capacity  and people mover  And the biggest factor RELIABILITY on this van is great  I know many who have had great experience with the Ford Econoline  I only hope if I get one I have the same great experience br br
