 We own a 1996 Ford Windstar GL  This was our first car that we ever purchased through a dealer  We have had it almost a year now  and we haven t had any problems at all with this vehicle  We are a young couple with two children  This mini van is exactly what we need as far as the kids and stuff goes  but it is also sporty enough to not make us feel like we are too old  LOL We love the fact that it has the seperate air conditioning in the back  So many times I have rode in a van that you were roasting in the back and they were freezing up front  This way the kids or whoever can control their own temperature in the back  I also like the radio controls in the back for the kids  that way if they want to listen to something on a long trip they are able to use ear phones if they want  It is also nice that you can turn those controls off in case your kids are too little to understand that they aren t just play buttons    The radio is nice in these vehicles too  We took it on a long trip this last summer and the ride and the handling of the car was nice  we even went up into the mountains and it handled great  No problem getting around those curves or up the mountain  This mini van is defanitly a van that the young and old can both enjoy
