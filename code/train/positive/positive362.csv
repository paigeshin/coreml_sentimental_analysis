 I m a Toyota person  but I came very close to buying the 2000 Taurus  I know that some people who have posted here have talked about reliability problems with Ford  But I think that was with their older models This car has a very handsome outside styling to it and beautiful colors to choose from  Their power driver s seat was one of the most comfortable  especially with the adjustable pedals 2000  I have ever sat in  and I can t begin to tell you the discomfort of my Corolla driver s seat  Also  in my never ending new car search  the Taurus was the most quiet at freeway speeds  The big  full center armrest adds a touch of luxury that seems to be missing from other cars in this class  The inside just felt so solid  sturdy  plush  and of course saftey  saftety  saftey  which is Ford s whole selling premise with the 2000 Taurus  Smart So why didn t I buy it  The gas mileage was a little low  18 19 street And  in the end  I just became obsessed with saving money and getting an  quot economy quot  car  not realizing that there s no value in saving money if you are dissatisfied in the long run  And gas prices are not going to stay high for ever  Me and my  quot poverty thinking quot  I realize now that I should have just went with what I really wanted  There s more to buying a car than simply trying to save money on gas  My advice is to buy more car than you think you will need  You ll be happier in the long run  I ll have a difficult time deciding between a Camry and a Taurus the next time I go looking for a car  which could be sooner rather than later
