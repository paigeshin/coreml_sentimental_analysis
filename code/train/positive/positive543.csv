 I traded in my Lexus   so I m new to SUV s and American made vehicles  But I was looking for something that would give me more flexibility and was fun to drive the 2002 Escape fit the bill  I first test drove the sister SUV the Mazda Tribute and was instantly hooked  When I started doing research I discovered that Ford sold the identical  minor trim changes  vehicle but usually at a lower price   and Ford was offering much better financing terms and more for my trade in A week after taking delivery on my 2002 XLT V6 with leather interior and the premium sound system  I went on a 4 day road trip and must say that overall I found the truck very comfortable  very economical  and fun to drive  There is considerably more road noise than with my Lexus   but I figured it was just because you are sitting up so much higher and you have all that trim and luggage rack that adds to the wind noise  I have read several reviews that talk about engine noise   I have heard none   just wind noise at high speeds  I do have a complaint about the placement of the steering column shifter   it does block easy access to the volume button on the radio   but once you get use to it   not a problem  There is lot s of cargo space which I have really enjoyed   a nice retractable cargo cover  and an adjustable luggage rack  I guess I m spoilt by the Lexus   but I find the carpets in my Escape to be a little skimpy   I just keep reminding myself that it s a truck  The leather seats are comfortable by not luxurious  the stereo on the other hand is actually better than the Lexus   great system  I like to drive with my headlights on and the 2002 comes with auto lights out after about 2 minutes but the irritating thing is the dinger still sounds when you leave the lights on  I don t see the point of having an auto lights out feature if the alarm is going to sound
