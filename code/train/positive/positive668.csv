 I bought my Mustang GT 1 year ago  It was a low mile  V8  convertible  I absolutely love it  A very fun car  The styling is great   better than the  99 s and 2K s  and much nicer than the earlier boxy style  The fit and finish is fine  It did have some acid rain damage from the previous owner  A trip to the body shop and  300 later solved 95  of the problem  The car is black  and I am very fussy  It s a bit noisy with the top up while on the highway  but heck  it s a convertible  The leather seats are very comfortable  I love getting into it  The 4 6L engine and 5 speed transmission are super  Plenty of power  Nice sounding stock  dual exhaust  I use the car mostly on weekends   as a fun car  It will be stored for the winter  This car will never see snow  ice and salt  A friend has a BMW 3 series convertible  Sorry  dollar for dollar  no comparison to my pony  The BMW is a high tech  high priced  sterile car  The Mustang is an all American muscle car  I could see buying a 6 cylinder coupe as a family or second car  although rear wheel traction would be a problem in winter
