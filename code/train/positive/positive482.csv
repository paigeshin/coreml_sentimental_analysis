 OK I have owned pickup trucks  and I have owned a pure  SUV  and for me  each is a compromise  In considering this purchase  I had to struggle with the question is a vehicle that has BOTH attributes nothing but a compromise at best My 1996 Nissan Pathfinder was handy  It had adequate room for hauling stuff  like groceries but not practical for hauling  dirty  stuff like building materials or plants  The back seats were not particularly comfortable either  It was a bit anemic in the power category but OK  I missed my pickup  but I need a vehicle that has a real back seat and in a way  the Pathfinder was a compromise that I could live with Still  I occasionally hauled things in the Nissan like bags of cement and bulky things from  Home Depot  that should never have been attempted with what is essentially a station wagon  I looked at  King Cab  pickups but saw them as just pickups with wasted space for junk behind the driver s seat  The idea of putting a human being in some of those  jump seats  they put in those things is laughable even for children Then came the first few  four door  pickups  Owning a Nissan  I stopped by and looked at a Nissan truck with four  real  doors  I attempted to sit in the back seat of one  and found that for me  the only way I could get in was to physically crawl in on all fours  and then sit sideways  It is hardly a practical vehicle  for me  unless you only expect to put children in the back seats Finally  last year I saw the Ford SuperCrew  and said to myself There is a truck car or was it a car truck I like  Essentially it seems like an Expedition with a 5 foot truck bed instead of the space for a third row of seats  In fact  the rear seat room in the SuperCab is only 2 inches smaller than the Expedition I drove the SuperCrew and that s all it took  I purchased the  Lariat  upgraded package because I like leather seats  and the paint trim was good looking  It came with the 5 4 engine  which was listed at  800 extra on the base model  I drive primarily in an urban area  and own a boat  that this truck pulls without effort  I expected horrible fuel mileage  but so far  I am surprised to find that in city driving  it is virtually identical in gas consumption to the Pathfinder I traded in  I realize that if loaded down  this will change drastically  however the good thing is at least with this truck  I have the option of  loading it down  While it is absolutely true that this truck is not a panacea for EVERYONE so far  it really is for me  I can put five adults COMFORTABLEY in it  I can pull a boat or trailer effortlessly  I can haul ten bags of cement or dog food  or throw my golf clubs in the back and not worry about snagging the upholstery of an SUV  I can use the bed extender and haul larger items  and I can pick up my family at the airport and not worry about my wife s  self esteem  being bruised by riding in a  pickup  The sticker price on this wonderful vehicle was actually  2 000 less than my venerable  96 Nissan Pathfinder  and while it doesn t have 4 wheel drive   that I hardly ever used with the Nissan  it does have EVERYTHING else  including almost twice the horsepower and the same gas consumption and MORE  The fit and finish for this  American made  vehicle is quite good  The Ride is excellent  The driving handling quality is excellent and for the features  the price is good too  The icing on the cake was Ford sponsored 3 9  financing PLUS a  500 rebate  One negative  I have to  back  it into my garage to close the door  as it is almost two feet longer than an Expedition  Oh well life has it s compromises
