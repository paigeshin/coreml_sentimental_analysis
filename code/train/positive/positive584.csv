 In 1996 I needed a new vehicle and since I already owned an 92 explorer I decided to go and see what more it had to offer quot OH MY GOD quot  was I shocked  quot THIS EXPLORER IS AWESOME quot  I fell deeply in love with something that is not human I had to take it for a test drive well I did and I paid cash on the spot  I couldn t believe how nice this vehicle is and to this day I will not give up this vehicle As a matter of fact I m in the market for a new one now  and I just can t wait but I have to at least one more week I m here to tell you that the ride and the feeling of being behind the wheel is such an experience that you will want to cherish forever and you ll try to keep it to yourself but you just can t do it  because once you drive it you just want to keep on going forever and you ll have to tell someone your awesome experience quot that you will never forget quot sooner than later The EXPLORER has everything that I could ever dream of having in a car such as cd player air cruse the best ride I ve found yet smooth when you want it fast when needed easy visuals and in dash equipment and much much much much more I ll tell you this quot if you like feeling in control or like going offroad or just taking a sunday ride  or going shopping in comfort style and knowing you ll be fine in the snow and be seen in awwwwed then this is the ride for you
