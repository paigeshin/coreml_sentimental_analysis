  Purely Physical  Originally I fell in love with the looks of the truck  The side steps  the sliding rear window  the emerald green paint job  the plush front seats  the little cupholders  and of course the awesome stereo system  The Ranger has been a decent vehicle mechanically until this last year but I will get into that later  Besides the physical appeal  the truck is incredibly  economical  to drive  That is important especially with these gas prices  The only car that gave me better fuel economy was an old VW Bug  The bed of the truck is capable of hauling small lightweight loads  I like it because not that many people ask me to help them move since the capacity of the bed is limited If you are looking for a truck with a lot of power this is not the one  The 4 cylinder engine would not be my choice next time around  I hate when those big trucks pass me by on the onramps The Ranger provides a smooth comfortable ride under normal weather conditions  However  I have had several problems with slipping in the rain and snow even on the lightest of days  I weighted the truck down last winter with 25 lbs  of sand and still had trouble on snowy days   Bad News  In the last year I have had to have the switches in both doors replaced that control the overhead lighting system  It really is annoying to be driving down the highway with inside lights that won t go off  This was a freebie because the dealership said there was a recall I also had to have the accuator switch on the ignition replaced just recently  One day I just hopped in the truck and all my panel lights were on as well as the radio but there was no key in the ignition  When I went to turn the key  nothing  That little trip to the dealership was  267 00  Of course my warranty ran out about 3 months ago  Now the check engine light has decided to come on and continues to shine brightly even though I have had everything checked out  Who knows why b Overall Rating  Overall I would say that this really has been a good truck but I do plan on going with a larger version next time with more power  The Ranger is priced right with a lot of features for the buck but whether you like the truck or not is going to depend on your ability to deal with the downfalls
