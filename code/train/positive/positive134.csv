 Wanna get hold of a fun  fast car  that s fairly good on gas  has a great reputation as an American classic  and holds up well over a five year period  Then the 1995 Ford Mustang is for you I bought my Mustang in Dec  1995  one year after the re designed  Stangs came out  My little champ is a basic model  V 6  3 8L engine  that still performs like the day I brought it home from the stable  It gets good gas mileage  20 city 27 hwy  has great suspension  corners awesome  and has been relatively trouble free  I ve recently turned 80 000 miles by October  1999  A few parts that I ve replaced include tie rod ends  struts  serpentine belt  and tune up parts  just did that myself about 3 months ago  and 4 new tires last year  Other then regular oil changes  there have been no major corrections needed for my Mustang  The engine is top notch  the transmission excellent  a none worse for wear under carriage  relatively rust free exhaust system  and good body still makes for a beautiful ride in this classic car A few cons include limited cab space  I wouldn t recommend this car to people over 6 4 quot   I m 6 2 quot  and the back seat is very cramped  only good for little kids  really  Also  due to the tight suspension  potholes can easily mess up the wheel alignment  I ve corrected this twice in five years
