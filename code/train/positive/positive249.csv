 My wife and I set out to try every convertible on the market  The range went from the tiny Toyota MR2 with absolutely no storage space   to the Chrysler Sebring convertible  We were ready to settle for the Chrysler when we spotted the Thunderbird in a Ford specialty showroom  We took it for a test drive and fell in love immediately  It was well above the price range we were shopping in  42k list  but in the end that didn t matter  We bought it two weeks later p The 2003 Thunderbird has two options that earlier models did not  280 horsepower and an auto manual shifter  Since the car weighs close to 4000 lbs  the additional horsepower was a welcome addition  It now runs 0 60 in a respectable 6 8 seconds  Keep in mind  this is not designed as a sports car  so acceleration in that range is admirable  The auto manual shifter is selected by pushing the shifter to the right  then selecting up or down a gear manually without using a clutch  We are still getting used to this feature  but I can say that it does improve acceleration p The overall look and feel of the Thunderbird can be summed up in one word   Style  The retro stylings take you back to the original Thunderbird in most every detail  Even the rag top has its original roots  Rather than take the car to a fully automatic top as was done in the Volvo C70  another Ford  they left a simple manual latch in the center of the top  with an automatic open close button easy to reach on the dash  When the weather gets nasty  our model came with the optional hard top  This top snaps easily into place  but be sure to have two strong adults to remove it  It weighs a solid 85 lbs and is fairly awkward  Fortunately it also came with a stand for garage storage of the top during the fair weather months p Inside the cabin you will find tastefully detailed leather seats  with wood and stainless appointments  Heated seats  dual climate control  6 disc CD changer  dash ignition key  steering wheel mounted radio controls  power mirrors  cup holders and cigarette lighter adapters round out the dash  Power seats make driver swaps a breeze p The real fun for this car is a good twisty road  Rear wheel drive combined with good weight distribution  and lots of it  make for a very fun drive  Brakes are extremely competent   especially given the weight of the vehicle  Testing panic stops left me very happy with the car s safety systems  With the top down  the noise level is acceptable  Raising the windows brings noise down to soft conversation levels  This includes both wind and engine noise  I can t believe how quiet the engine is while cruising  Put your foot in the floor and it will audibly remind you of the v8 heritage under the hood  Speaking of the windows   each time you open the doors  the window automatically drops a quarter inch to release from the rag top  The window automagically creates a tight seal when you close the door again  Inserting the key in the ignition prompts the power tilting steering wheel to return to its previous position in front of you  One turn of the key  and you wonder why you didn t just sleep in that comfortable driver s seat  Unfortunately the trunk only has space for a couple of small suitcases or a large garment bag  This would not be a good car to take on a two week tour of the country p Gas mileage has been fairly consistent  running 18 city and 23 highway  We only have 1500 miles on the car so far   the engine won t really be broken in until 3500 miles or so I have to give Ford credit for building a high quality product with little competition  This car is a definite head turner  be it a weekend driver or a daily commuter
