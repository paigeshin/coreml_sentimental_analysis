 The new 2000 Ford Mustang GT is an awesome car  I own the car in Performance Red the new color for the 2000 Model year  The car is everything a person could want  It has a nice 4 6 Liter V8 engine with 260 horsepower  The 0 60 in this beast is in the low 5 s  The only thing I don t like about the car is the back seat  but since I am the owner of the vehicle I don t sit back there  The space in the back is kind of small but it can still fit 4 comfortably  The thing I like about this car is all the looks that you get in it  It s awesome  Also if you are a big car fanatic like myself then there are so many different things that you can do to your car to make it different than others  A new option also on the 1999 and 2000 models is Traction control which really does help  I have noticed a tremendous difference which its on  The options i got on my car was a 2000 Ford Mustang GT  Leather Interior  5 Speed Manual  and other options  I just recently purchased the car and I Love it  I paid just under  30 000 for it  Overall experience with the car is I am 110  satisfied  I recommend this car to someone that loves cars br br
