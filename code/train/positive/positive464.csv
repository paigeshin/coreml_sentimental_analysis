 I didn quot t buy it  I leased it  I leased it to try it out because I had a 1997 ford explorer and I wasn t happy  The explorer wasn t what ford raved about  It was very noisy  lack of power  and the new 4 6 overhead cam engine had alot of problems  Over the two years I had this vechile I was at the dealer 41 times  for recalls and noises  When I went to the dealership to give back the explorer I looked at the expedition and I really liked what I saw  The truck had alot of room  It s standard equipment had alot to offer  and the price seemed to be right  Compared to the explorer where I was paying  443 00 per month  and now I could pay  5 00 more per month for more vehicle  When I picked up the truck a day later and left the dealership I couldn t get over the ride  It was like night and day  the expedition handled nice and tight  It wasn t noisy  But I thought to myself let s see what happens in a couple of months  Well after two years I m still waiting  Don t get me wrong I have had some problems but very minor  The rear wiper stop working due to a loose wire  There was a recall on the signal switch  and on the tires which were rectified immediatly  Those were the only times I been to the dealership in the two years  except for regular maintence I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody who likes a low maintence vehicle  But most of all I would recommend this vehicle to the big family or for the person who needs alot of room and wants a really nice comfortable ride instead of getting a big oversized chevy thats very tinny and sloppy
