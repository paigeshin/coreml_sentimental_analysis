 We just purchased our Excursion this past week  As a past owner of a F 150 Conversion Ford Van for over 10 years I have found that the Excursion is not much more than what I have been driving  We purchased a car also this past year to try and keep miles of Van  but I found myself going back to driving the van because I never felt safe in a car  My reason for the purchase of the Excursion are  being safe  towing power   we have a 27ft travel trailer  room for passengers  comfort  What I am saying to this as I read many opinions about how big and unsafe it was for the Excursion to be out on the road  might I add  that it is most of these small cars and trucks that are going over the speed limit and taking the chances  We  big car owners respect the roads and are more observant of our surroundings  I m sorry all you small car owners feel this way but keep your eyes on the road and off our big Trucks  I might I also add there have been F 150  F 250  F 350 on the road for years  the only different in this Truck is that it is covered  It handles like a charm  hugs the road great  and as for parking  I just park it like I did my Van  As for gas  well I did not buy it for that  I knew it was not much on gas  and we have not had it yet long enough to find out  We purchased the 6 8 V10 Limited  I have also read that people have strong feelings about the pollution problem with these big Trucks  might I add to this  when you are in the cities  look around at our transit system and count how many people might be riding at that time  I have seen at times when there are maybe 5 people on the buses  so what do we do about this problem  As for the tilting effect  No  but then I have driven a Big High Top Van  Maybe to those who are going from a car to this may feel this  But I can not say that  As for rattles  have not heard any  and the seats are great  So as my opinion goes  No this is not a Car truck  for everyone  Yes it is a great driving Truck  handles well  and I respect it  We did fill it up last night and our gas range was about 8 9  However that was the first fill up and we only drove it around town  We have been told once we get it broke in and out on highway we should do better  Again this is only my opinion  and I hope those of you who have just purchased one enjoy it as much as I do mine  Again to me it is no different than what I have always driven  Just everyone  be it small car owners or large car owners  keep your eyes on the road and what you are doing and not on what someone else is driving
