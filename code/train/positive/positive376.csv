 Don t laugh  but I love my Ford Escort  I am currently driving my second Escort  purchased in 1994  I call her Trixie and she has carried me to and from work daily  on vacation and around town for the past six years  The odometer reads 67 973 miles but you need to add a digit to realize that it now has a total of 167 973 miles on it  Yup  167 973 miles and still putt putt  putting up the road  I put well over 100 miles per day on the odometer  not counting side trips  My first Escort lasted for seven years  so this one has already outlasted that one  All jokes and smug looks aside  anyone who has owned an Escort will tell you that they are a good little automobile  Replacing worn out parts is a fact of life  so I have never worried when I needed new brakes  timing belts or unfortunately a new transmission  A NEW TRANSMISSION YOU SAY  Yes  but it was no fault of the Escort  it my own negligence that caused that problem  I remember well the day the mechanic asked me when I had last had the transmission fluid changed and I replied  quot Changed quot  I think you can almost imagine the look on his face  The new transmission cost  1200 00  parts and labor  but it was well worth the money  I preferred to invest that money in my little car rather than to put it toward the purchase of a new auto  I consider it the same theory as paying for a heart transplant for a loved one  The mechanic who put in the new transmission even admitted that he liked the little Ford Escorts and said he had purchased one for his son to drive  He explained that he called them  quot disposable cars quot  because typically  owners of Escorts purchase them and drive them until they die along the side of the road  tires pointing up like poor little dead insects  Most Escort owners drive them until they have 200 000  miles on them  How many other auto owners can make that claim I love the size of my Escort since it is easy to maneuver  Living in Ohio  where our winters can deliver deep snow and freezing rain  the front wheel drive is a life saver   literally So  all in all  I am terribly disappointed that Ford has decided to stop making the Escort  I have no idea what I will purchase next  but then I guess I still have over 40 000 miles left to make that decision br br
