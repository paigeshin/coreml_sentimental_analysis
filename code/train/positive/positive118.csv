 At first glance  it looks like you Uncle Ernie in Florida s grand marquis   and some other times  it looks like the feds or local police are after you  but on the other side of the windshield  lies magnificent comfort  and classic large interior and seating  in leather on this sport model  Look downwards to the  police radio   lol  and find a leather wrapped floor shifter for its butter smooth 4 speed auto transmission  This is not Uncle Ernies retirement car  it s a rocket ride  Thats right  police and this sport share in the 235 horse power motor  4 6   new modular technology   v 8 motor along with real dual exhaust  I wish it were a tad bit louder  like its big cousin the Maurader  but you can add from my research Dynaflow for a slightly louder rumble  Gas mileage has been fair to good  keeping my feet off the pedal is hard to do  especially when you turn traction control off  you can lay one hell of a big burnout  ala 60 s and 70 s style  The paint finish is fabu  no defects  inspected the engine and it is well constructed  although they could fancied up the engine area and added a nicer air cleaner    i would opt for a after market air filter and canister   and nicer trim in engine compartment would help  The wheels are 17 inchers and the tires Goodyear  now if you read my article on the 97 Jetta  you ll know that Goodyear tires are somewhat soft and wear faster  we will see how these LS model tires work out  Ive seen the 2003 Crown Vic Sport and i can honestly tell you that the 2002 is bound to be a classic  the wheels on the 2003 are narrower to make way for clearance with the new rack and pinion front end on 2003 models  i prefer the 2002 look my self  also gone are the plush leather seats  they are now ALA Marauder style ribbed leather  SO far i have put on 5 900 hundred miles and have had the first service done  also i might note that insurance for this car was alot less than most cars  thank goodness for Uncle Ernie
