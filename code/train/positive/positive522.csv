 If so  this is the vehicle for all your adventures  Whether one mile to your destination or 687 miles  it is still the most comfortable ride I have ever had Car buying can be such a hassle  but this buying experience was not  My honey and I chose a beautiful red Explorer  We like Dodge products  but their prices are much higher than Ford  The look of the Explorer was also an attraction next to the price  This Explorer has power everything  seats  windows  etc  The roomy Explorer has seats that fold down and a cover for the back behind the seat  so people don t have to see what you are hauling around  It is so nice to carry our golf clubs in a nice  reachable vehicle  versus a deep  dark trunk or a dirty pick up truck  The radio ahh  it has a CD and a tape deck  How many vehicles have you seen like that It had approximately 3000 miles on it when we decided to take a trip down to Alabama to visit some family  I was so amazed at the comfort and coziness for such a long trip  The radio was blasting and we were singing away  happy as we could be  I never thought we could be so happy driving for a long period of time in a vehicle You would think this vehicle wouldn t corner well  but oh my  you would be so surprised  I don t even feel it going around a corner  It is completely smooth  better than a car  No matter where we have been  I always am comfortable and feel completely safe  Many of our friends have complimented us on how comfortable it is to ride in the back seat  None of them get sick anymore  We can take people and stuff anywhere and not ruin the comfortable exploring we do If you are looking for a roomy  comfortable get around vehicle this is a good choice br br
