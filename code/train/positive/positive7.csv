 The 99 Taurus sports a very new look compared to the 98 s and below  Along with major changes in exterior  the interiors have changed dramatically with redesigned radio faceplates  and a neat pop out drinkholder that also doubles as an extra passenger seat  unless of course you opt for the floor console shift  Personally I like having the cup holders and extra seat The Taurus also rides like a charm  driving is very smooth  Driving at speeds of 55  you still feel as if you re travelling in slow motion  making for a nice quiet ride  Of course you can drown the quiet with the nice am fm cassette radio  Standard  I can trim the BASS Trebble to full  and max out the volume  and the sound is still quite clear and most enjoyable  unless you have tame ears The engine is also very  quot sporty quot  for a car not classified in the sports car category  You can put your foot to the floor and be in and out of traffic before your heart catches up with the rest of you  It catches nicely  and under less than ideal conditions  cars coming at you running red lights  the handling was superb  allowing full control of car without major loss of steering and braking control Overall the car is a must buy if you want a sturdy car  with lots of goodies  and a great safety record not to mention it looks a lot neater that the 98 and below Taurus s Author note  This is an edit after 10 000 Miles with 1999 Taurus  So far No problems  although one door is sticking a little  and the interior fan at low speed can be heard I ll have them checked next time I have my paint recoated  Will try to update this Epinion every 10 000 miles br br
