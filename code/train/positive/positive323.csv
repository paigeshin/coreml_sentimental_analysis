 For those of you who were born after the 70s  or were not old enough to drive then  you missed something special  That was the experience of owning and driving one of Detroit s huge old style luxury cars  Though each manufacturer had its own fleet of flagships  all of those cars had one thing in common  Luxury  And it was luxury that you just can t find today in any American car  because nothing else is like owning the sheer mass of a 70s American luxury car  The 1974 Ford LTD was a fine example of this departed breed  Mine was a two door coupe with a landau top  despite the car s huge dimensions  the styling gave it almost a rakish appearance  Being manufactured nearly 30 years ago  natural resources weren t in such scarce supply  either  thus the rich appearance of the chrome grill and bumpers  I find these vastly preferable to the plastic creations of today  Mass was another thing this car has in abundance  the two door model weighed over 5 000 pounds  Besides being almost completely invulnerable in a collision with another car  its huge cast iron V 8 made it nearly impervious to overheating in the summer  In fact  there were several times during my ownership that the radiator failed completely  yet I drove for miles without knowing the cooling system had broken down  simply because the car didn t overheat  Ride quality was fantastic  nothing upset this car s poise  not bumps  railroad tracks  potholes  or debris  Driving on the expressway at speed was like floating in complete isolation of the road  The interior was dead quiet  no wind or road noise  no rattles  squeaks  groans  or vibration  That only enhanced listening to the stereo  you didn t have to turn it up to overpower road noise to the point that the sound was distorted  Whatever your pleasure  be it hard rock or string symphony  you could relax and listen to it at a comfortable sound level  Interior room simply has no comparison in a modern American car  unless you go to the truck like Suburban or its kin  Vast  airy  and expansive  six adults sit with room to spare  The old style bench seats give you every possible square inch of seating area  Likewise  the trunk is huge  easily swallowing a dozen or more bags of groceries  plus two spare tires  or enough luggage for a whole family  Naturally  a car this old has its quirks  though they weren t seen that way when it was built  because it had the technology of its day  and not the 21st century  The engine was nothing sophisticated  cast iron block  no computer parts or modules  and pre electronic ignition  Tune ups  and engine maintenance in general  are much more frequent than on a modern car  Can you handle tune ups every 10 000 miles  and oil changes every 2 000  You ll also pay for replacement parts that no longer exist on modern cars  and for servicing they don t need  Are you old enough to remember points and condensors  Did you have to take your first car in to have its joints lubricated every 3 000 miles  If not  you re going to learn something  Other aspects of the 1974 LTD may also require some deep thought before you buy  The model I had boasted a 351 cubic inch V 8  It was a smooth running engine but only had moderate horsepower  about 170  Cars were like that then  not like cars now which can give you 200 horsepower in a 200 cubic inch engine  The point  The car s power will do for everyday driving  including  emergency  passing  but you ll never burn any rubber  Fuel costs to run this car may seem preposterous  but remember it was built when regular unleaded sold for 43 cents a gallon  Suffice it to say that even with the smallest V 8  the 351  which was advertised as an  economy  engine then  you ll get about 10 miles per gallon city  and about 14 miles per gallon highway  And by the way  there s no fuel injection in this car  it s got a carburetor  Still  there s nothing like driving a car like this  with a hood that s long enough to be the prow of a yacht  and a cabin that s big enough to be the command room of a battleship  Such cars may never again be built by American industry  but this essay is in remembrance to the times in which they were
