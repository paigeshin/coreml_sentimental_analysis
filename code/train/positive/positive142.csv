 We recently purchased a new Ford F 150 Super Crew for the reason that we wanted a truck  We looked at the Dodge Ram  the Dodge Dakota  and the Ford Ranger  The F 150 was the most comfortable and economically sized  When we decided to test drive  the ride was smooth and quiet  All controls were perfectly situated for an easy ride  That was when we decided that the F 150 was what we wanted  Since then  I have been more than happy with our purchase  We have taken it with us on long road trips and even had to sleep in it which made for an accurate night of sleep  I was impressed with the comfort I felt that the F 150 had made during the long drive  I highly recommend this truck
