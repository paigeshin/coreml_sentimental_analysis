 Want a valuable truck without the gas guzzling  Buy a ranger  This is my second ranger and I haven t even parted with my first My original 1994 ranger has over 150k miles and still runs like new  I just bought the 99 for a fresh start but I will keep the 94 for work purposes In both models gas mileage is excellent  Out of the 3 years I have owned the 94 I only had to pay for general maintenance  The only downfall is that it lacks in power  it takes a little to get the speed up there but hey at least it helps from not getting any speeding tickets If your in the market for a light duty inexpensive truck that will last a long time  I recommend highly checking out a ranger and talking to other people that own one br br
