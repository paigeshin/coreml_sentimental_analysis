 My husband and I bought a new 2004 Ford Focus ZX3  comfort package  this past weekend  and here are my impressions so far  it is a really great little car  very responsive  very easy and fun to drive  and has enough pep with the 2 liter engine  We also tested the Toyota Echo and the Focus felt much better  We were planning on buying a Hyundai  either an Accent or an Elantra  just because they re so inexpensive and they ve got that great warranty  But the Hyundais FELT cheap  By comparison  the Focus feels VERY well put together  very solid  very reliable  There s a lot to love about the Focus  lots of head and legroom  plenty of cargo space with the seats folded down  they re really cute  very easy to drive  fun even  There are a few things that I ve discovered I really like  such as the fact that the reverse lights are VERY bright so you can actually see where you re going when you back up  the turning radius is great  I live in a big city so this is a plus  the seats are quite comfortable  the gauges are easy to read  and the controls are simple and easy to get used to  I like the fact that the cabin lights come on automatically when you turn the ignition off  that s really handy  A few things I ve discovered kind of annoy me about this car  the main thing I don t like is the clock  I have the CD MP3 player stereo  and when the radio is off  it s fine  but if you re playing a CD or listening to the radio  the time is displayed in the bottom left corner and is so small that it s difficult to read  you have to press the  clock  button on the upper right to get the time to display across the top for a few seconds  I wish it was the other way around  you had the clock display all the time and had to press a button to see what track or station you were listening to  Another thing is the overdrive  I don t know if this is standard for AT s with OD  but its default is ON  and you have to press a button to turn it off if you re driving in the city  on hills  etc  Since I live in a hilly city and rarely drive the freeways  this is kind of annoying  since I have to remember to turn it off every time I turn the car on  The seatbelts are a little far back  requiring a bit of a reach  Other than that  I am completely happy with this car
