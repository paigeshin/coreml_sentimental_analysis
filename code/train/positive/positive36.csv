 This was one of the best cars I have ever owned The gas milage isnt too bad  I feel very secure driving this car I feel like I could pickup and go to Florida if I felt like it  I would highly recomend this car to anyone  I know that alot of people say it s huge but when you are behind the wheel it dosen t feel that big  So if you are looking for a good reliable and inexpensive used car and size doesnt matter try it out I thin you ll like it Also if you can find one with a premium sound system you certainly will not be disapointed br br
