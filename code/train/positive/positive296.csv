 We bought our new 2000 Ford Windstar last October and have been extremely happy with our purchase so far  There have been no mechanical problems at all Here are some of the features that we like best about our Windstar It drives much more like a car than a van  It doesn t have that top heavy  awkward van feeling to it on corners  We were also impressed with the amount of pep the engine has  While it s not a Porsche  it does have very impressive acceleration for a van   much more similar to a car again than to other vans I have driven On the back of the back seat there are these great little hooks that you can use to hook grocery bags onto when you go shopping  This seems like a small feature  but we really love it  You no longer have to worry about the ice cream falling onto it s side and leaking  and you never have to repack your bags with all the items that spilled out during the drive home The idea of removable seats is great  We often take them out when we go camping and put a mattress in the back  It makes for an extremely comfortable sleep  The only thing that would be better would be if they could make the seats lighter  You need to be fairly muscular to take out the single seats  we took the four bucket seats in the first two rows and the bench at the back option  while the bench seat at the back is really a two person job to remove and reinstall Having the sliding doors on both sides is a very helpful feature that allows you to easily access just about anywhere in the vehicle  We used ours to move across the country  and found it very helpful in packing and accessing our belongings once they were packed in We were quite impressed with the stereo system  Before hearing it  we had discussed having a better system installed  but once we had our first listen  we decided we d keep the factory installed model The climate control system is quite good for the people in the front two seats  From a cold start it heats up or provides air conditioning very quickly  however there are no air vents to provide circulation to passengers in the back  A couple of times now when we ve had a full load of people  we have either had to bake or freeze in the front to keep our passengers in the back comfortable  I m not sure if there was an option to have rear climate controls  but if there is it will be something we will think about getting next time  We don t often have many passengers  so it hasn t been too big of a problem for us  but if you frequently carry a full load of passengers  it s something you might really want to think about  I should add that there are two windows at the back that open slightly to help with air circulation  which is great for your passengers when it s hot and you don t want to use air conditioning  The tinted windows that we opted for help with this too Finally  if you like to bring beverages in the car with you  there are more cupholders in the van than you would believe
