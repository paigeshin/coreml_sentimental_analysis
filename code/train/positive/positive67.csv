 Every year or two  I decide that it s time to purchase a new car  My wife and I have owned several car models  and two motorcycles  Our last car was a 1997 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  This was a program car that we got a good deal on  We quickly racked up 50 000 miles on it  in just over a year  Last month  we decided to shop around for another SUV  We looked at the Dodge Durango  the Envoy  and a few other vehicles  However  we eventually ended up back at Ford  looking at the 2001 Expedition XLT  We bought it the same day  I guess when you find something you like  it s best just to stick with it b Seating  The Eddie Bauer model we owned did not have a third row seat  The salesman stated that the third row is now standard in the Expedition  The extra seat allows for comfortable seating for eight passengers  The third row is accessed by folding down the short seat on the passenger side of the truck  Because the third seat sits up higher than the front two rows  the leg room is much more limited  However  it still allows enough room for average size riders to remain comfortable  It is an added benefit knowing you can carry extra riders  with everyone in a seatbelt b Climate Controls  The Eddie Bauer Edition had a sunroof  which meant that there were no rear climate controls  I find this to be one of my favorite features  During the past few HOT weeks  the XLT seemed to cool down faster than my Eddie Bauer model did  The rear climate controls have vents in the second and third rows  The rear climate controls can be shut off from the main control switch that the driver operates  just in case you have young children that think it s fun to run the heater during Summer months b Engine  The Eddie Bauer has a larger engine  sporting the 5 4L Triton 8 cylinder engine  The XLT has a smaller  more fuel efficient  4 6L 8 cylinder engine  Both models are 4 wheel drive  I have not experienced a noticeable loss of power with the XLT  but have not taken either vehicle  four wheeling  I have ample power for passing  I towed my motorcycle and trailer on the Eddie Bauer model  with no noticeable lugging on the engine  The XLT does not come with a tow bar  and I haven t installed one yet  I believe that I may notice the difference in engine strength once I start using the truck for towing  Other than that  the power is more than sufficient for normal driving  I have been getting around 13 or 14 MPG in the city  and around 17 or 18 MPG on the highway b Radio Controls  The Ford Expedition comes with a decent stock sound system  I am not a power freak when it comes to speakers  As long as I can hear my music at a moderate level  without distortion  I am satisfied  The Ford Expedition delivers on this point  The sound system also comes equipped with a six CD changer  The CD changer is located in the center console  which is much larger than the older models  Ford removed the armrests which were installed on the older models  and extended the width of the center console to compensate  This allows for several additional CDs  other than the ones located inside the CD changer  The old center console did not even have enough room for the six CD jewels for the CD s inside the changer  The radio has rear controls  located on the back of the center console  These controls adjust volume  and change radio stations  It can be very irritating when a youngster realizes that they can change your station with their toes  while your tooling down the road listening to your favorite LRB song  BUT you can shut off the rear controls by pushing two of the pre set buttons on the radio  simultaneously b Remote Access  The Ford Expedition XLT comes with two remote control buttons  that allow you to lock or unlock the truck from a distance away  I have tested it from inside the house  and have successfully unlocked the truck  They claim that the controls are unique  There is also a keyless entry pad located beneath the driver s side door handle  which contains five buttons  with the numbers 1 through 10  two numbers per pad  The vehicle comes with a password  that allows you to unlock the door with a combination  A great feature in case you lock yourself out  I m still not sure where I stand on that issue as far as security goes  but I figure it would be quicker to break the window to steal a car  than try and figure out the password b Comfort  I liked the armrests that the older models of the Expedition had on them  However  I have adjusted my ride to allow for resting on the center console  The seats are very comfortable  and are great for long rides  I prefer the cloth seats of the XLT to the leather interior on the Eddie Bauer  because leather is VERY cold in the Winter and VERY hot in the Summer  The climate controls are efficient  the mirrors adjust easily  and the seats have numerous settings to get that  just right  position  In case you find the comfortable seat position  and find yourself short of the gas and brake pedals they have an adjustment for those as well  Just pusht the button  and they ll come to meet you b Handling  When discussing SUV s  you would expect to hear how they handle off road  However  I do not intend to drive mine off road  I got a 4 wheel drive vehicle to handle the sometimes treacherous Winter storms we get up North  Since I have only owned this model for two months now  I have not driven it in heavy snow  However  I have driven over the rough post Winter pot holed roads in my area  and it has handled the bumps well  Smooth as glass  No  Yet still comfortable  The vehicle corners well for a top heavy SUV  and accelerates smoothly  except on steep inclines b Car Seats  I still have one child in a carseat  I have found the Ford Expedition to be one of the best vehicles I ve owned in regards to installing removing carseats b Overall Impression  I have been happy with the Ford Expedition  I think that the highest compliment that an automobile manufacturer can receive is to have a customer duplicate their purchase  I have never owned a Ford product prior to the Ford Expedition  but have become a believer  at least in this model  The Ford Expedition costs a little bit more than some of the models in it s class  and less than others  The market has become flooded with SUV s  with everyone getting in on the action  In fact  four classes of SUV s have emerged  mirroring the car market  However  Ford Expedition is among the oldest and most time proven models of SUV on the road  As long as my Goodyear tires hold out  I ll be happy with my purchase
