 Hello I love my Ford F 150 supercab  The fourth door in the 99 s was a wonderful idea  I have had three F 150 s and by far this on is my favorite  It is so convenient to be able to go and open the doors from either side  Packing and unpacking is so much better  The only thing I can think of is the noise reduction needs to be worked on  There is alot of noise driving down the highway  I have had it checked out at the dealership and they have told me that is the truck  Nothing is wrong as far as the truck goes  Please make it a more quite ride for people that enjoy cruiseing down the highway listening to there music  Also  the fold down console is not very convenient for your arms  Make the console longer  The fog lights are wonderful  I have been able to get home at night many times with your fog lights  I lived fifty miles out of town in the mountains  There were nights it was snowing so bad  I could not see the road in front of me  The fog lights is what got me home  I wouldn t have a truck without them  If anyone wants a wonderful truck  get yourself a Ford F 150 supercab  You will wonder why you did not do it before now The seats are very comfortable but solid  This makes for a long drive a very pleasant and comfortable drive  Remember  drive a Ford F 150 and you will see what I am talking about
