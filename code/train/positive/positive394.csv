 Ok  I have reviewed the 97GT and the 89GT mustangs  but currently I can t locate any better place to post this opinion that might save you 1000  The intake manifold on the 1996 Mustang GT was made of a composite material  Unfortunately  the material was not strong enough to handle the horsepower of the V8  so at around 40 000 to 50 000 miles it cracked Intake manifold acts as a cooler where water and antifreeze circulates  You can probably drive your car for a few miles after there is no water in it  but its damaging and dangerous  You can even burn your engine doing this  And believe me  SOHC V8 does get hot  Ford recalled 1996 GT s and replaced the intake manifolds with more durable ones  which were used on 97 and 98 GT s If you do a research for a recall on your 96GT  you will find that there is one  Unfortunately  some of the 97GT s also came out of the factory with the weak manifold  There is no recall on the 97GT  and quite a few people have spent 1000 bucks on a new intake because of this Here is what Ford won t tell you  The intake manifold is really their problem  and even if your car is out of warranty  its their responsibility to replace it  If you own a 97GT  and your intake cracks  do not pay for a new intake  Take it to Ford  and tell them what happened  They will say that there is no recall on your car  Act like you know what you are talking about  and tell them you spoke to Ford and they said there is a  program  on the manifold  They will change it within a day at no cost to you  given that the manifold is indeed cracked  Make sure that it is  otherwise they will charge you 100  just for looking at it  Also  you can get the SVO supercharger or the aliminum SVO intake with a 500  discount if you loose your manifold  The supercharger is 3k  and will be dropped down to 2 5k   its worth about 100HP  The aliminum intake is worth about 20HP  and is a good base power mod if you are planning to go real fast in the future   ex  get a Vortech S  Trim  etc br br
