 This 1989 Ford Probe is a sporty and spunky little car  It is reliable and always ready to run  My 1989 Ford probe has 212000 miles on it to date  I have had very little trouble with the engine  It blew a timing belt but when replaced it ran great  This problem was my fault  as I was aware that timing belts should be changed periodically The 1989 Ford has quick pick up with the turbo engine and it gets in and out of traffic with little trouble  The paint has held up very well for an eleven year old car  It is fun to drive but watch out for tickets  It gets good gas mileage even at this late stage  It continues to get 29 miles to the gallon and the spark plugs have not been changed in 2 years  The air conditioner has been the only problem and that is because there no protection in the grille  It is very easy to get a rock in the condenser  This can be eliminated by putting in a screen to protect the condenser  I would rather have this little stick shift model then a new one  I believe the 1989 Probe will be considered a classic in later years and I am going to hang on to this one  This is the car for someone who likes the sporty look likes the feel of a car  is interested in reliability and value and may want to keep it for future appreciation
