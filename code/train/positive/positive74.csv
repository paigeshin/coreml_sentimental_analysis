 The 2000 Ford Econoline E350 12 passenger van we purchased in November is a perfect fit for our growing family  We ordered this van in August  before the birth of our 6th baby and while we had to wait a few weeks longer than anticipated  it was well worth the wait After driving a minivan for 6 years  the size of this van was a bit overwhelming at first  But I love the height when driving around town and on the interstate  Scraping ice and snow from the front windshield is tricky because of the height  Getting in and out of the van is good exercise for me  since we have not gotten running boards yet  The van handles wonderfully  even in snow  Parking the van is a learned skill  since some parking lots are designed with smaller parking spots  The cd cassette radio sounds great and is easy to use and program  The spaciousness of the van allows me to move pretty easily from front to back to help buckle and unbuckle my youngest kids from their car seats and there is plenty of space to put grocery bags during our monthly shopping trip  The only thing I have to complain about is the space between the front bucket seats and the engine hub  There is not enough space to sit sideways in the seat and slide around to the front This van is a must have for growing families  Even if your family hasn t outnumbered the seats in a minivan  the kids will eventually be too uncomfortable in the cramped space br br
