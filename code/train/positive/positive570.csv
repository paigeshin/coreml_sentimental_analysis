 I got to choose a new car for my graduation present  I always wanted a Mustang but I never thought my parents would buy one for me  After looking at many types of cars I narrowed my decision down to a Mustang and a Pontiac Grand AM  The Mustang had so many more options compared to the Grand Am  First of all  it comes fully loaded including power locks  power windows  CD player  automatic seats  etc  The price of the two cars were the same  but I would of been a moron to choose the Grand AM because it did not have to same package deal  I took the car off to college with me and found i could get most of my stuff in it because the trunk is pretty big and the back seats fold down  I recently went on a road trip with three other people in the car  I thought it would be miserable for the passengers  To our suprise  the Mustang had plenty of knee room and space to sleep in the back seat I love the storage compartments and the cell phone adaptor I have not had any problems with this car  I m very pleased with my car br br
