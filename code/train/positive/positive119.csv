 108 000 miles  3 brothers  and 15 years later our little 4 Door LX Hatchback Blue Escort is still capable of cruising down California roads  Four days ago  however  the Escort entered into retirement when I purchased a new car  The car has held up excellent throughout the years and is only showing signs a few minor problems now  well after 100 000 miles Compared to cars today the LX Escort offers very little in terms of options  It has an air conditioning system which provides ample amount of both cold and hot air  but when it s turned on the engine really loses a lot of power  It is not recommend to turn on the air conditioning when traveling uphill or at times when you need every bit of power the engine can give you  The car comes with a standard Ford stereo which is basically an AM FM stereo minus a cassette player  The speakers do an adequate job of handling any power  but again compared to today s standards sound terrible  They are not capable of handling very much bass before they start to make a crackling sound  The car also offers powering steering  automatic front shoulder belts  and a warning noise if you leave your lights on  The best feature of the Escort has been it s gas mileage  I ve been able to achieve 320 miles on one tank of gas  With high gas prices in California  refueling my tank every 3 weeks or more was a blessing  The car is capable of getting more than 320 miles to the tank  but you may start dipping into your reserve fuel The worse feature of the Escort is unfortunately the safety concerns  This car was built before airbags were required in cars  and because it s so small a massive collision could be potentially very harmful  Although the shoulder belts automatically strap on they provide very little safety it seems  I ve pulled on the shoulder straps violently several times and they have failed to catch  I m not sure if this is age or if it happened when the car was new  since the car was passed down to me  The car also offers poor handling  The tires are small and overall the car is very light  High winds have a tendency to blow this car from side to side and you can t take turns too fast without feeling like your going to tip over  But the Escort LX did exactly what it was supposed to do  It offered a quality car to get you where you wanted to go  This car offers no luxury but it wasn t purchased for luxury  It was purchased to get three boys to and from college  and it succeeded in doing that for 15 years  If your looking at purchasing an Escort LX  Kelly Blue Book recommends that the car price not exceed  700 to  1100  This is for a car with no major mechanical or body defects  I think the car would be perfect for someone on a really tight budget that just needs a car to get them from point A to point B
