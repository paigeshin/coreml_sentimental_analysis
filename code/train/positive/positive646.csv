 I just graduated from college  moved to a new city  and needed a car  I didn t want very much  just a cheap car with good gas mileage  I was willing to sacrifice looks  endure insults from friends  even deal with some visits to the shop in short I would have settled for a Hyundai  Kia  or a Yugo if they still made them  I thought that with such standards finding a car would be easy  but as I did my research I realized that it wasn t The gas mileage most economy cars get was a big surprise to me  Considering the lack of size and horsepower that defines most economy car engines I expected my high gas mileage requirement to be easily filled however no car under  13K did that  Granted I want more than most people seem to from reading other opinions on numerous cars  I am fairly environmentally conscious and I would buy the Honda Insight in a second if I could afford it  I expected a car with at least 30 miles a gallon in the city and in the 40s on the highway  If you want that too don t bother looking under  13K  Echo  Corolla or Civic are your only options  about 33 city 41 high way  Golf and Jetta as well if you raise the price bar a bit more  Most economy cars are rated about mid 20s in the city and high 20s low 30s on the highway  I am not sure why people are impressed with this gas mileage my  92 Buick Skylark was getting about 22 30 and that thing is old  heavy  and had  I think  2 2L I4 that was definitely not multi valve  Some of my friends have SUVs that get low 20s high 20s  Anyway  another way to think about it  if the weight is light and the engine is small what accounts for gas mileage that is 30  less than something like a Corolla  I d call it bad engineering  May be engine timing isn t as good  may be compression ration is low  may be transmission sucks  Probably all of the above and more  I was seriously considering getting a Corolla   Echo gets expensive quick after you add some necessary  options  It is a great car  my dad owns one and I drive it a lot  Reliable  great resale value  great gas mileage  quiet  etc  I didn t really want to spend 13K though  I probably would have gotten one  or a Hyundai Accent  if my friend didn t work at Ford  Because I could get a good deal I decided to check out some Ford cars  I am not the biggest fan of Ford and even though I own one now I definitely can t say I trust it  But with dealer and factory incentives thrown in the Escort was the best deal I found  believe me  I looked at every economy car more times than I ever thought I d need to  and it is definitely one of the best looking compacts out there I don t want to bore you with the details of everything you get in this car  I would recommend that you go to the Ford site and check it out  But here is a short list of things that Escort had that many others didn t  rear defogger  yeah  really  15  tires  aluminum wheels  cassette deck  remote trunk  60 40 seats  spoiler  power mirrors  tachometer  intermittent wipers  etc  Also  you get keyless entry if you opt for the power group  In no other car I found do you get as much included and after all is said and done the car was less than 10500 withOUT the college rebate  i didn t end up using my friend at ford this was a lower a price than he could get I also think it is the best looking car under  13K and it holds its own for higher priced cars  Most people compliment me on the car and everyone thinks it cost a lot more  So I didn t have to deal with insults from friends after all    And it doesn t say Escort on it anywhere if you get the 2001 model I had the car for about 2 months and 2600 miles including some long road trips  One thing to note is that it is a four seater  There is no middle seat belt  Check the roominess stats on your favorite car web site it isn t much  even Corolla has more hip room in the back  but it is enough  Four people are comfortable and five people is manageable  There was no complaining from three passengers in the back after over eight hours in the car  and I got my share back there too Also  the trunk is small  Coupes are not hatchbacks  As far as trunk room you d do better with almost anything else  Echo  Focus  Corolla  Civic  except may be for the Accent  But again  I think the trunk is sufficient  5 people fit their stuff for a 5 days trip with no problems  including sleeping bags OK  now for actual driving The car is noisy  Perhaps not too noisy if you are used to driving Ferrari s but it is very noisy if you are used to Corollas  Noise is definitely hard to ignore if the radio is off it is virtually impossible  Having a conversation with someone is hard with normal voice  Road and wind noise are enough but the engine also makes a lot more noise after about 3000 RPMs  And then there is a lot more noise after about 5000 RPMs  My recommendation is test drive it  take it on the highway roll the windows up and see if its managable  Oh  turn the radio and the sales person off until you want them back on The engine is pretty fast and the tranny is responsive  Unfortunately this is my first manual transmission car so my opinion is fairly unsubstantiated  Somewhere I saw the acceleration stat of 0 60 in 7 8 seconds  It seems about right and this is fast for a compact  Its on par with cars like the Eclipse  The other day I left a 300ZX in the dust yeah yeah you don t have to tell me he was probably asleep  but it still felt nice  Seriously though  this car is fast enough to be fun  No old lady will pass you as you are trying to merge You will need to shift a little more the gear ratio is definitely shifted to the low end  Expect to shift out of first almost immediately and expect to be in 5th at about 45  if you want power though 2nd gear will carry you into the 60s  Oh and a huge disappointment to me the transmission is not overdrive  It is listed as overdrive on a number of websites and I thought it was but it isn t  Expect about 3000RPMs at 70mph  My guess is this is largely responsible for low gas mileage  reported 27 33 although I ve been getting more like 24 29 though its still early to count As far as raw speed passing power  Rest assured there is enough of it  I was a little concerned with the engine being at 3000RPMs at 70mph but there is no reason to be  I trust you ll keep this a secret but on a recent road trip I took the car up to about 110mph with a full trunk and 5 people in the car  And the engine was still comfortable at around 5000RPMs  red line is at 6500  Assuming there is no governor on it this car will easily top out the speedometer  120  Now the point isn t that you should drive that fast  the tires are only B rated   but to convince you that there is plenty of extra power to pass even at high speeds As far as reliability I still don t really trust it  It doesn t really feel like a solidly built car although I am sure  don t know though  that it compares very well with cars in the 10K range  And supposedly the reliability ratings for new escorts have been decent  One example of questionable cost cutting is that the alternator is rated at 48AMPS and is a heavy duty model  Most cars  in fact all other cars I saw  use at least an 80AMP alternator  Odds are the thing will need replacement early especially if you are using lots of utilities on the car I think this review is getting pretty long but hopefully I gave you more than a re listing of features you can find anywhere else  For the money it was a good car  I sacrificed gas mileage and reliability to get this deal  If those things are very important go with a Corolla or a Civic you will make up the difference in price when you sell  I checked blue book values  If you want bottom priced car and can get this car for around  11K without options I think you are getting a better deal than you would with an Accent or a Kia Rio  If above else you want a good looking car with some pep for cheap this is definitely among the strongest contenders especially if they offer  1500 back again  However  if you see yourself spending  13K or so on this car I would definitely say give some other cars a very close look Another thing to remember is that this is either the last year or close to it for the Escort  The Focus is replacing this car and the ZX3 has the same engine but is a much better overall car  Without cash back the two cars cost almost the same
