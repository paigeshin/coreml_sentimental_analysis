 I bought this car specifically for work  I transport disabled clients to and from job interviews  This vehicle has a lot of room without being too large  I hate driving tanks  This vehicle has been so good to me for the past 3 years  The maintenance required is low  I had to have a timing belt replaced at 85 000 miles  Other than that it has been oil changes  brakes  and tires  The usual repairs The only complaint I have at this time is the drivers side seat belt  It has gotten stuck in the middle of moving into the lock position  I had to disconnect the wiring at the base of the door  Otherwise it makes an annoying clicking sound  It cost over  200 to have this fixed  I have 3 friends who have escorts and this has been a problem with them also Other than that I have no complaints  It is a very reliable and trustworthy car  I never have any concerns when I take it on long road trips  I hope others find this vehicle as enjoyable br br
