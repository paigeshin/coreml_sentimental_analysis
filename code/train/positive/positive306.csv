 When I set out to purchase a new auto  I did not really give the Explorer that much consideration  But  now  after owning it for just over a year  I can say that I am truly pleased with it  I was impressed with how much you can tow  the pulling power of the engine  and the stereo is not too shabby In my occupation I am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and I kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger  but  the Explorer is still larger that Chevy  I think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway  the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo  I wish Ford did a little bit more to make the auto more to insulate the exterior noise  In my occupation I am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and I kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger  but  the Explorer is still larger that Chevy  I think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway  the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo  I wish Ford did a little bit more to make the auto a little bit more to insulate the exterior noise  Oh ya  last night while driving to work  I got a flat  I think that engineer who designed the tire changing system  never had to USE this system  It was a real pain I think that I like SUV s more simply because sitting at a higher elevation  you get to see more of the road and it gives you time to mentally digest more information in a timely manner  When I was a truck driver  this is one thing that I found to be of particular value when driving long hauls  I like the seats  they have found to be comfortable on long or short drives  I think that the side step bars or great for my wife  who is a little vertically challenged  My kid uses them as well to climb up and out of the auto  Pleased I got it overall
