 The good  Bought new at a  quot fleet quot  dealer for under  10 000  F 150  auto OD  A C  4 6 Triton V 8  AM FM  PS  PB  Long bed with full liner  tow pkg Has started every day  runs good  Roomy  good power  comfortable  Fairly reliable The Bad  3 recalls  Lug nuts  fuel line  door cracks  When something goes wrong  it is big and expensive  Transmission slipping   432 00  for what amounted to filter  fluid and slight adjustment  Steering linkage 372 47  for what amounted to lubrication and slight adjustment  MAP sensor 811 14  fouled for no reason and needed replaced I suppose that isn t that bad if you consider it is almost 4 years old  However  to have it recalled 3 times and to put that much in to it  it only has 60 000 miles on it  When it runs  it is great  When it breaks  it is costly Had A 1990 Chevy 1500 with 400 00 miles on it  I put 399 000 of those miles on it  It still ran good when I sold it  It cost me exactly  227 97 for a rear end gear at 297 000 miles  However  I have a friend that has a 1998 Chevy 1500  that has 32 000 miles and has been in the shop more than my Ford  He is on his second motor and his computer just burned out last month  Go figure Vehicles are far too subjective to lead someone to buy one  I would and will buy another Ford at trade in time   6 mos from now  The Competition is just too  quot tinny quot  and flimsy  I suspect Ford got the bugs worked out since 97 was the new model  Except for the problems I have had  the truck is an excellent buy  Especially what I paid for it br br
