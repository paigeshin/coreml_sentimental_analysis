 For 99 Ford made many improvements to the Mustang GT  More ponies  more leg room and a body redesign  The 99 Mustang GT does what the Mustang has always done  A good sports car at a good price  This doesn t handle like a Corvette but it s less then half the price  For the price this is probably the best deal for your money I ve had this up to top speed  147 MPH on the speedo  It ran as smooth as can be  If any law enforcement personnel are reading this I did this test on the track as far as you know The car handles very good in the corners  The back end is a little light though  The back end wants to swing out when you turn fast and hard  but what I m talking about here is VERY extreme cornering  Normal sports car corners are no problem  One problem  this car is like a cat  it hates water  Drive on wet pavement carefully or the you ll be spinning like a disco ball br br
