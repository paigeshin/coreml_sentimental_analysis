 I am overall very pleased with my Taurus  I am a student and my budget was tight  Accords of similar vintage cost roughly double  and up  of what I paid for this Taurus  Car was purchased with just under 140 000 on the odometer  Car currently has just over 162 000 The price paid includes conditioning costs  New Brake Pads  New Tires  Good Year Regettas  New Oil Pan  New Fuel  Oil    Air Filters  Thorough vacuuming  shampooing  and vinyl conditioning Things done prior to purchase by previous owner  New Struts  7 months  New Exhaust  1 yr old  New Hose   Belts  All maintenance done  records included with car  All recalls taken care of  Air conditioning switched to R 134a and refilled  New battery Problems with car  Surface rust on drivers door  fixed with friend The Little Things I Like  Self supporting hood with light  Courtesy lights on front doors  Drivers side dual sunvisors  allows you to put one to side and one to front  Blue tinted  factory  reduced glare mirrors  Secondary controls for radio  Separate clock  Bi level dash  Vents include a positive off position  Roof racks  Console  Powerful Air Conditioning  More powerful then our Toyota  Powerful Heater  Interior gas and tailgate release  Hatch can be opened with just window or whole tailgate  Large controls for power windows and power door lock  Power window drivers lock out  Dual air bags  ABS Standard  The 3 8L moves the wagon better then our 3 0L Camry under a load  Starts in  25C and 40C weather  first try every try  Large alternator and battery  Ride soaks up bumps  barely feel speed bumps  Storage compartment in rear floor  Blue gauges The Things I Don t Like  Weak Speakers  AM FM Cass not CD  Foot actuated parking brake  Seats dirty  spills from previous owner  One cupholder  Small Steel 14  wheels  Headlights aren t as strong our Windstars  Rear turn signals are red  No fender mounted turn signals  Common in N A  Rear wiper doesn t have intermittent setting  Front passenger window lazy  Stories heard about the 3 8L engine  Space saver spare  No Tachometer The Ride Quality The Taurus is not as sporty as our Camry  The Taurus sounds busy when accelerating  However once up to speed the Taurus is fine  Dash shakes at about 180km h  The Taurus seems more stable in winter driving conditions then the Camry  Brakes take a bit long to stop on black ice  The Taurus has very light steering  Power steering assist is a bit extreme  Not much feedback through wheel  Going over speed bumps is no problem  The Taurus doesn t like taking corners at much above the posted speed limit  When taking corners in the wagon you have to be careful due to the long rear overhang  Traction in the winter is adequate  I just worry about people slamming into me who don t have ABS  has happened twice The exterior Front marker lights are large  The car has clean lines but lacks styling and personality  Rear taillamps are only adequate in size  Turn signals aren t as noticable as our Windstar   Camry since they are not amber  Lower body cladding  Car seems lighter then the new Taurus  Windows are large  The curved rear window seems like it would cost a lot to replace  My body handles are easy to operate but are black and ugly  When you lift any of the four handles the interior lights turn on The interior The low dash gives good visibility all around  reminiscent of a Honda  Interior has that  old version of modern feel  to it  The front seats seem to be the same shape as the old Camry  Interior of my wagon only holds 5 people  Not much lumbar support  Seats are covered in a soft material   The material in the Windstar is much plusher  Overall I like the seat comfort more then our 2000 Camry  The Taurus has more windnoise inside then the Camry   although part has to due with the age of the car  Cars have come a long way in comfort  Interior plastics seem a bit too shiny  The interior plastics in the 2002 Ford Windstar have a softer more luxurious feeling to them  There is a handy built in pen holder  All controls are easy to reach  Radio has many small buttons  but that can be said about any DIN sized radio  Handy storage compartment below radio  The ashtray  my coin holder  is illuminated  All switches on the door and dash are illuminated except for the controls on the steering wheel  Wheel mounted cruise control is easier to operate then the stick type found on the camry  Dashboard clock is a nice touch Overall I am satisfied with my Taurus  It has been no problems with only oil changes every 5000km  So far the car is holding up very well
