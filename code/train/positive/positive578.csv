 You love your wife  but sometimes she eats too much I love my 1996 Ford Explorer XLT  It is nice  attractive  strong and quiet  I bought this car to have my family in a secure vehicle when on road  Before buying this car I tested similar SUVs such as Toyota 4Runner  Nissan Pathfinder  Chevrolet Blazer and Mitsubishi Montero The Explorer comes loaded with a bunch of features you will not easily find on other SUV  I love the knob activated four wheel drive that allows me to turn it on at any time or any speed without stopping the car  This is useful when it starts raining and you want your tires to stick to the pavement  The engine is powerful enough to handle the truck  but may be a little less responsive in short accelerations  I corrected this problem with the installation of a PowerJet  150 There is not other SUV that offers the comfort  luxury and beauty of a Ford Explorer  This is a car to fall in love  Everything is powered  the back seat radio and air conditioning console is definitely a plus Mileage is definitely an issue  The Explorer eats too much  My average consumption improved a little after I installed the PowerJet The ride inside the Explorer is quiet  soft and smooth  You can barely hear the motor or the transmission  It took me a while to know how to handle it  It drives amazingly well in straight roads even at 90mph  but you have to be careful when cornering I had a transmission problem during the warranty period  sort of a solenoid was replaced  Few months later they replaced the gas pump solenoid too I recommend this truck to any family that wants comfort security and adventure  The Explorer is great for long trips and its cargo area fits more stuff than you could imagine  Believe me  my wife brings the whole house into the car when we go on vacation  My wife loves the sense of security this car provides and she can handle it easily Recently I decided to sell my Explorer and went looking for another SUV with better mileage  None of the year 2000 models I saw  could barely compare in features to my Explorer  I still keep it  it is a vehicle you want forever  just like a wife even if she eats too much br br
