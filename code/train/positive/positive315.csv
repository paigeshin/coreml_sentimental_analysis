 Wehn my parents were looking for a new car they were especially interested in a van  Only problem was that they didnt know which one  Whether it be a Quest  Sienna  Caravan  or Windstar  First  we were interested in the Sienna but they were very hard to find available and they are a heck of a lot of money  Then we came across the Windstar  What a van  it was very spacious and we got it at a great deal  In the front seat there is an unbelievable amount of leg room  And don t worry about the back seats plenty of room for any sized person  I recommened to get bucket seats in the middle seating area  Much more attractive and private like for the riders  The seating is very comfortable and the remote door feature is an ideal one for youngsters and elders  C mon think about it  you know how heavy a Van door is  Right  Well all you have to do is press onw button and it is opened for you  I also recommend that you select the option of no middle console because the van is much more spacious without  And you really dont need it because there is a big bucket type drawer on the fron console  The trunk of the van is also unbelievably huge  I couldn t believe it when i saw it  So take my advice and go look at a Ford Windstar br br
