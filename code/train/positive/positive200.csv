 Stright and to the point  For a 4wd station wagon it is great  I was a truck user and had been for years  thought it was time to move up to a SUV  Biggest mistake I ever made First lets talk about the great things that the Explorer is  It is a great family car  It has a super ride  The interior is very plush  The sound system beyond anything I ever needed  The handling and ride superb  Lots of cargo space for luggage for trips  or for carring the groceries  Now dont try to help someone move with it because all your going to put in it are the small boxes  I used mine to help my daughter move from one apartment to another  Way to many trips  took forever  Own a home and need to do some lumber hauling  golly don t want to get wood slivers in that nice carpet or just cant get that 4 x 8 sheet of plywood in the back  I would highly recommend this SUV to anyone who is looking to buy a station wagon or a really nice family car br br
