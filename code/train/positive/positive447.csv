 The Ford Windstar is a great minivan for those families out there that are always on the run  I love it  It actually drives like a car even though it is pretty large  It has a nice look and is comfortable  I have had this van for four years and it is still holding up  I recommend this to anyone who wants a minivan that drives great and is worth the price  I bought it for  25 000 and it is great  I have had no problems with this car and recommend it  Take it from me  the Ford Windstar is a great van and worth the price
