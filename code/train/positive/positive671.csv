 With all the hype about the 2000 Ford Focus  you d think that Ford was giving away rocketships  Is the 2000 Ford Focus a well equipped  comfortable economy car  Absolutely  Is it the dawning of a new era of Euro styled  ergonomically attuned  New Edge globally conceived econovehicles  or whatever the marketing gobbledegook says  Uh  I dunno  That part is a little over my head  but it sounds overstated  It s just a car  but it s a good car b Mission Affordable b I wanted to purchase a new car for my sister for her birthday  I m no millionaire  and her needs are simple  She doesn t drag race  Nor does she haul a horse trailer  transport Scout troops  or need to make a socioeconomic statement with her vehicle  She just needs to commute to work and get to wherever else she needs to go  It would be nice if her butt didn t go numb and if she didn t explode into flames in the process  In the past  my family has had a host of American label economy cars  and I admit that that s what I m partial to  I looked at a number of comparable cars  Chevrolet Cavalier  Dodge Plymouth Neon  Saturn S series  Ford Escort  etc  I had never even heard of a Ford Focus until I began researching new cars  and I certainly hadn t seen one  But in the end  that s what I ended up with  My sister is happy  I m happy  I d do it again  I d recommend this car to others b Bang for the Buck b So  what does  16 000 get you these days  The standard 2000 Ford Focus SE sedan costs  13 660 MSRP  12 716 invoice  One can visit Ford s official website  www fordvehicles com  for all the specifics  but this includes such standard features as  dual air bags  air conditioning  am fm radio with cassette  power locks and mirrors  remote keyless entry   quot securilock quot  passive anti theft system  panic alarm  24 hour roadside assistance  15 quot  wheels  60 40 split fold rear seat  manual seat height adjuster  vanity mirrors on both visors  interior trunk release latches  3 year 36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty The options I selected are as follows upgraded  quot Zetec quot  engine    200 MSRP  178 invoice automatic transmission    815 MSRP  725 invoice comfort group  arm rest with storage  tilt telescoping steering wheel  cruise control  map lights    395 MSRP  352 invoice front and rear floor mats    55 MSRP  50 invoice power windows    295 MSRP  263 invoice anti lock brakes    400 MSRP  356 invoice The destination fee is  465  and the manufacturer determined advertising fee is  130  These two fees are supposed to be non negotiable  Adding all this up gives a figure ranging from  16 415  MSRP figures  to  15 235  invoice figures  This makes the 2000 Ford Focus SE sedan an affordable car  but not the least expensive car that one could possibly purchase  I will echo what everyone else has said  For the money  this car offers a lot of features and feels like a more expensive vehicle  Also very relevant to me  since I wanted to finance this car  is Ford Credit s attractive financing rate  In my area  the best credit union offered a 7  APR on 4 year auto loans  Currently  Ford offers 5 9  for the same loan  4 9  for 3 year loans  and 6 9  for 5 year loans  This is another area where one can save a few dollars with this vehicle b Form Embodies Function b Either you think that the 2000 Ford Focus is attractive  or you don t  There s not much middle ground  The SE sedan looks very similar to a Volkswagon Jetta with ugly and unmistakable triangular headlights  It took me a while to learn to accept the headlights  I admit  The car is tall and blunt not unlike a Toyota Echo with a hood that arcs sharply downward and a rump that seems a bit elevated  It s not to everyone s taste  to be sure  Several professional writers have called the sedan  quot boring quot  but I think that it is an appealing car  I think that the Focus hatchback is an eyesore  however  To each his own  Frankly  I don t select a car based strictly on aesthetics The shape of the car is functional  to be sure  Because it is tall for its size  it gives the illusion of being a larger car  Seats are set high enough that one doesn t feel like their  quot knees are bumping the handlebars quot  when seated  It has accurately been described as chairlike or mini van SUV like inside  Legs hang comfortably  and one views the road from a taller vantage  You don t feel vulnerable in this car like you might in some other small car  It is easy to get in and out of  because the seats are rump level  I found that the back seat is especially comfortable in this regard  Similarly  the elevated height makes it easy to access the trunk without a lot of bending and stretching   What I like about this car b Roominess  As discussed above  the car feels a lot bigger than it is  In addition to head and leg room  the trunk is cavernous  Both back seats can be folded to offer even more cargo area  I expect a small car to feel small  so the roomy feel to this small car is a really nice surprise  Comfort  No question about it  this is a very comfortable car for its class  The fabric seats are well cushioned and supportive  The suspension absorbs irregularities in the road very effectively  My neighborhood is rotten with potholes and road construction at the moment  and yet I barely feel any lumps and bumps in this car  Even though it s a small car  I could travel a distance in it with ease  The back is sufficiently spacious for two passengers  especially kids Adjustable driver s seat  Related to the above is the driver s seat itself  It is adjustable in three different ways  The back of the seat can recline as much as you need it to  The seat can be pulled closer to or further away from the steering wheel  And the seat can be raised and lowered  I love the latter feature  Some writers have complained about the simple crank mechanism that raises or lowers the seat  but I consider it refreshing to have a non electronic means to adjust the seat  The fact that I can do it at all is wonderful  but the fact that it didn t cost me a small fortune as an option is even better  This is particularly important because my sister and I differ in height by six or seven inches Adjustable steering wheel  If adjusting the seat isn t enough  the steering wheel can be adjusted up down or in out with the tilt telescoping properties  Whether someone is short or tall  small or large  I believe that they d be able to make the necessary adjustments to be totally comfortable in this car Handling  This car is really a pleasure to drive  The small diameter steering wheel has comfortable swollen grips on it  and the steering is accurate and easy  Braking is similarly responsive  In spite of some of the literature that suggests that the car is underpowered  my experience is that it is very zippy  Put simply  it starts  stops  and turns very comfortably and easily  It feels very secure on the road  never light or tippy or weak  not bad for a car that only weighs 2 600 pounds  I can only imagine that anyone displeased with the handling is comparing it to something out of its class  perhaps a larger luxury car or racy sportscar  Peace and quiet  The Focus is smooth handling and surprisingly quiet in certain respects  Turn signals quietly tock tock tock  The hydraulically opening trunk is shockingly quiet  as are the doors   By contrast  I jump a foot in the air when the doors automatically lock as I drive away  That s loud  Again  in spite of reports to the contrary  I have not found that the engine is excessively noisy  You hear it rev when you accelerate  but it s never loud enough to interfere with conversation  My friend s Saturn has a much louder engine Silly little things  The storage slots on the inside of the front doors for holding maps and such are really wide  You can easily fit a novel instead of just a magazine in these slots  One of the things I like best about that is that it makes them easy to vacuum clean The radio faceplate can be removed easily so that the radio is rendered functionless if it s stolen  I don t know who would steal the factory radio out of an economy car  nor do I know who would worry about it getting stolen  but hey  it s one of those fun things to show your friends  Worth noting  the radio allows you to preset 6 am and 12 fm stations  If you have a lot of favorite radio stations  that s a nice feature  There s a pen holder next to the driver s seat  The glove box is huge  You could fit a Taco Bell dog in there  along with your owner s manual  The ASPCA advises against this  however The owner s manual comes in a nice little zippered storage case that looks sophisticated  There are special hooks in the back seat to attach car seats for little ones  I don t have kids  but if I did  that would be a big plus  There are two great big cupholders in front with removable liners that can be easily cleaned b Gripes b Visibility  This is the biggest drawback to the Focus  With a hood that arcs sharply downward  it is virtually impossible to see the front of the car  You get a feel for where it is  but I d hate to have to parallel park this thing  It s not a car for tailgaters or big city parking for that reason  Similarly  the car s rump is elevated  so it s difficult to see where you re going when you back up  The big  obtrusive  front headrests and car frame itself further impede visibility rearward  The side mirrors compensate for this  however Illogical controls  Most of the controls are clearly labelled  and for the most part I have no complaint  But some of it seems senseless to me  The hazard light switch is the single most prominent feature on the dashboard  It s a huge orange triangle that begs to be pushed  I m in my thirties  and I ve never had the need to turn on the hazard lights in any car I ve driven  Even when the switch is less obvious  I ve always known where it was  but I ve never needed to use it  Why on Earth is it so prominent in this vehicle  What is Ford trying to tell me  By contrast  the am fm switch on the radio is microscopic and situated way to the right side of the radio  I ve learned where it is  but I still have to take my eyes off of the road to find it  Am I the only person who finds this irritating Windshield wiper controls  The turn signal control is on the left side of the steering wheel  In most cars I ve driven  the windshield wipers are located on the same stalk  Not in this car  The windshield wiper control is a separate stalk on the right side of the steering wheel  Why  This particular departure from convention annoys me Fuel gauge  It annoys me that I can t read the fuel level without turning the car on  Similarly  the odometer is an led panel that doesn t appear unless the car is on  I m not sure what the point of this is  other than to look fancy  But I suspect that with age  if either of these things got quirky  it would be expensive to fix them  Rear floor mats  Um  these things look like furry business envelopes  They re tiny  I believe that floor mats have become standard on the 2001 Focus  I certainly wouldn t pay extra for the rear ones Marketing  I have simple tastes  so I find a lot of the marketing for this car to be incredibly annoying  The brochure for this car is ugly and contains almost no information  Although the target market is young  20ish 30ish  women  the sales pitch is gimmicky and yuppified in tone with lots of irritating buzzwords bandied about  Anybody who uses the term ergonomic should be run over with a Hummer  Ironically  all the hype stresses how  quot European quot  this car is  I ve always owned American cars  I like American cars  Don t tell me that my Michigan built Ford is European  dammit  It s a turn off   The unknown b Reliability  Nobody knows  plain and simple  I purchase a car with the intention of putting 150 000  miles on it and keeping it for ten years or more  I hope this car carries me there  In any case  I ll update this as needed to reflect my gripes and concerns b Warnings b If you order your Ford Focus  be aware that they take forever to arrive  I was promised mine in 6 10 weeks  and it showed up 14 weeks later  Judging by what other people say  the average wait is about 12 weeks  Also  keep in mind that some people have had problems with these cars  Take a look at the  quot town hall quot  at Edmunds  www edmunds com  and or the message board at Club Focus  www discussion board com clubfocus  to see what others have had to say   Bottom line b Be clear about what you want in a car  If you want an economy car that is comfortable and well equipped  at least consider a 2000 Ford Focus  Do your homework at Edmunds  www edmunds com  and other online sites  Take a look  Go for a test drive  My sister used to be a firm Ford hater  but she loves this car  If I had it to do over  I d buy it again  Hopefully it will stand the test of time
