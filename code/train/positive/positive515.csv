 This xmas my wife took me to the ford dealer to see a vehicle  A lot of our friends own and drive Ford Explorers and we have heard many good things about it but to tell the truth  I wasn t too thrilled  That was the 23rd of December  Today I have owned an Explorer for 2 weeks and I can tell you that I am nothing but pleased  It is everything our friends had said about it and more  We bought the Explorer XLS four door  It is roomy  You ride very high and it gives you a great view of the road  The ride is smooth and it handles very well  The  23 000 price tag  includes a c  stereo w cd  running boards  luggage rack  and luxury wheels  The gas mileage is very good  especially for a vehicle this size  and the engine has lots of pep  Up to now  all I can find that is not to my liking is that it idles a wee bit rough for a new car  I test drove others and they all did the same  Overall  I feel that we got a lot of value for our money and would surely recommend that anyone thinking about buying a new car take a serious look at the Ford Explorer br br
