 I recently purchased a 2003 Ford ZX2 and even though I have only had the vehicle for about a month I am very happy with its performance The reason for choosing this vehicle was after my wife had read the consumer report on the vehicle we felt that safety was an important feature and this car seemed to be just that  The car has a very sporty look to it and the size is just right for a smaller family  The price also was very reasonable and with the trade in on my Grand Am and the cash bonus my final price was just under  10 000 00 In this day of high gas prices this was another reason for my choice  My ZX2 is a 4 cylinder  but I was very surprised with the power it still has  Going up hill does not seem to be a problem for this car and the smooth ride for the size is just right for me  After checking gas mileage around town I am averaging about 26 miles to the gallon  I live in an area with many hills and with that type of mileage I was very pleased  As far as the safety I spoke of earlier the vehicle seems to be built very solid and that was very important to me  If you are like me you read all you can on something before you spend a numerous amount of money  so even though I have only had this vehicle a month I am very pleased to say I am happy with my purchase
