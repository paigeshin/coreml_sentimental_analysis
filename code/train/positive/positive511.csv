 Last spring  I needed to trade in my rear wheel drive 1994 Explorer Sport for a four wheel drive or front wheel drive vehicle since I was in the process of moving to a cold weather climate  If I d moved to a warmer climate or remained in Virginia  I would not have parted with my Explorer because it was such a great vehicle and had been easy to maintain  and it was paid off My husband and I decided that I should look at SUVs exclusively because having one in the family allows us to do partial do it yourself moves for which the government will pay us for the amount of household goods we move ourselves  rather than the commercial moving company contracted to move the bulk of our things  it s like getting a bonus for bringing along the luggage and essentials that we d take with us anyway  Also  my husband was very insistent that I continue to drive an SUV for safety reasons  I began test driving SUVs and looking around for potential replacements  In the process  I drove a Nissan Pathfinder  a Nissan Exterra  a Ford Escape  a Ford 4 door XLT Explorer  a Mazda Liberty  a Mercury Mountaineer  all new  and various used models  including a 2000 Ford Explorer  Since neither of us wanted to shell out  30 000  for a new SUV  a used vehicle was more within our budget  In all of my test driving experiments  I found that I liked best the handling and turning radius of my 1994 Explorer and the other Explorers I test drove and decided that I would be happiest with another Explorer and narrowed my search accordingly On April 2  I purchased a white  2000 Ford 4 door XLT Explorer  This particular vehicle had been a rental car  auctioned off after a year  still under the manufacturer s warranty  and had nearly 24 000 miles on it  In the seven months I ve owned the vehicle  I ve put another 10 000 miles on it with moving from Virginia to New England  going back for our wedding  and various trips between my duty station and my husband s on the weekends as well as regular day to day use b Gas Mileage  The 2000 model I purchased gets slightly worse gas mileage than the 1994 Sport I owned  The 1994 Explorer had a standard transmission and was about a foot smaller without the additional passenger doors  My gas mileage hovers around 15mpg in town and 19mpg on the highway  Since I have less of a commute  my fuel costs have gone down significantly  rather than up  However  this is not a fuel efficient vehicle b Features  i Safety Features   The 2000 Explorer XLT has anti lock brakes and dual front seat airbags  The vehicle comes equipped with a remote keyless entry system and an anti theft system  The ignition key has a chip inside it so that the vehicle cannot be started except with the ignition key  or by a really good professional car thief  The driver s side door also has a keypad so that if I lock the keys in the car  I can punch in the code to open the driver s door only and retrieve the keys  I ve found this feature very useful when I want to go running  I lock the house keys in the car  run  and unlock the car using the keypad so I m not carrying keys with me  or losing them  while I exercise  The remote keyless entry system unlocks the driver s side door with one touch  With two touches  it unlocks the rest of the vehicles  I like this feature because I can control unlocking the doors independent of each other  by only unlocking the driver s door  I can jump in and lock that door quickly  possibly preventing an assailant from getting into the car through another door  The windows have a lock feature controlled by the driver which has come in handy  During our drive from Virginia to New York  we allowed the cats out of their crates  As they wandered around the interior of the vehicle  one of my cats stepped on the window control of one of the back passenger doors and the window began to roll down  I immediately flipped on the lock and rolled the window back up so that my cat wouldn t get any bright ideas about jumping out of the car at 70mph  I believe this feature will also come in handy when I have children in the car i Cool Gadgets   The 2000 Explorer has a CD player in the dash  as well as cassette and an AM FM radio  The vehicle came equipped with cruise control  air conditioning  rear air conditioning  which my cats and other passengers appreciate  two visors each for the driver and front passenger seats  spare tire mounted underneath  lots of cargo space  about a foot more than the Explorer Sport  six way adjustable driver s seat with tilted steering wheel  power locks  windows and mirrors  two cup holders in the console that accommodate different sizes of drink containers  and an extra charging outlet that my husband uses for his Palm  The overhead compartment for sunglasses is too small for the case  but too rough to put my sunglasses in  The temperature feature is nice  but I find the compass fairly useless and could do without it  I opted for a vehicle with cloth seats instead of leather because I find leather to be sticky in the summertime and too cold in the winter   Repairs and Maintenance  Unlike my 1994 Explorer  I ve taken the 2000 Explorer to a dealership twice and had it repaired under the warranty   I did not purchase the additional warranty since my last Explorer was so reliable and the manufacturer s warranty on this vehicle is good until December 2002  The first repair was for the back window wiper  At first it worked  but sporadically  and eventually quit working at all  The motor was burned out and replaced  I noticed that I had to ensure that the wiper is properly positioned after opening and closing the cargo window  which can be opened independently of the cargo door  The wiper is positioned so that it sometimes gets trapped when the window closes  I m fairly sure that the wiper was trapped and various rental car drivers would turn on the rear wiper and just leave it on  burning out the motor even when the wiper wasn t working The second time I took the Explorer in because the ABS light came on when I started the vehicle and stayed on  indicating that the anti lock brake system had disabled itself because of a problem  My assumption was correct  and the service department made the necessary adjustments to the brakes that had caused the ABS to disable itself  Like the 1994 Explorer  the 2000 Explorer has all the owner operator parts marked in yellow  the oil dipstick  the battery  the various liquid wells  I ve had the oil changed once since purchase and it s due again  At the oil change  no other repairs or maintenance were needed other than the oil was a quart low when I brought it in I am slightly annoyed that I had to bring the vehicle into the dealership for service at all  since I did not once use the warranty on my first Explorer  But the repairs were free so I can t complain too loudly b Handling  As I stated above  I kept coming back to the Explorer because it handled so much better than the other SUVs I test drove  even the slightly longer 4 door model  While driving an SUV statistically protects you more in accidents  I see SUV drivers all the time flouting the road conditions and driving like maniacs  Newsflash people  an SUV will protect one more in an accident  but isn t it better to not be in an accident in the first place  If the road conditions are hazardous due to snow or rain  driving an SUV does not give one license to continue to drive at 70mph when everyone else is going 45mph  The high speeds in bad weather conditions not only endangers oneself and one s passengers  it also endangers the other drivers on the road who have more respect for the necessity of slowing down in bad weather  My other rant concerns the stability of the Explorer  The vehicle does have a higher center of gravity than a car or some of the smaller SUVs  Driving an SUV requires some adjustments  one often has to take curves more slowly so that the vehicle won t tip over  The Explorer is very stable  if one drives it keeping in mind the higher center of gravity  If you think you re a racecar or stunt driver  this is not the vehicle for you b Cost  With my trade in and some bargaining  I paid just under  19 000 for my used 2000 Explorer  which actually worked out to a little bit more than what I paid for my new 1994 Explorer  The 2000 Explorer  at the time of purchase in my area  had a Kelley Blue Book retail value of approximately  25 000  so I felt like I got a good deal  Of course  the dealership low balled the trade in value of my Explorer  but I bargained them down to the price range I wanted  18 19 000   I have a theory about why dealerships low ball trade ins  The consumer pays the sales tax on the new car  If the buyer trades in a car  the purchase price is lowered accordingly and the buyer pays sales tax on that price  The dealership  however  would have to pay sales tax on the used trade in  I assume  To pass that sales tax along to the buyer  the dealership tries to get the used car price as low as possible to reduce their tax while the buyer has to pay more in sales tax on the new car  Since I am a service member with residency in Nevada  I don t have to pay sales tax when I buy a car so the amount I got for my trade in mattered very little to me as long as I got the overall price I wanted  This is not the case for most car buyers  If you know why dealerships low ball the trade in values  please satisfy my curiosity and leave a comment b Overall  I highly recommend the 2000 Ford Explorer XLT  The standard items are very convenient and easy to use  the vehicle is easy to maintain  I have plenty of cargo room for moving 600 800 pounds of my things  or even waiving furniture delivery fees and transporting pieces of furniture home myself  I love this Explorer almost as much as I loved my first one
