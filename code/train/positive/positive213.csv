 Despite the criticism the Contour has received  I ve found the car to be fast  comfortable  and a joy to drive  It seems that they got just about everything right in the  98 model year  and it missed the major decontenting that occurred in the  99 and 2000 models  For just over  9 000 in early 2001  my  1998 5  I still think my 20K mile  1998 5  Ford Contour SE V6 was a great buy  The SE trim level also features traction control  ABS  and other features that are great in the winter  and aren t found on every car at this price level  I ve found it handles great around curves or daily driving  while acceleration is quick and responsive  I m sure the V6 helps in this regard  I ve never driven the Zetec 4 cyl  but I understand some feel it s a bit sluggish in a car of medium size like the Contour  Whatever the case  the 170 horses put out by the 2 5L Duratech are plenty  and highway cruising  lane changes  and quick acceleration prove no problem At higher speeds  the engine is a bit loud  although many like it that way  so it s just something to consider  I tend not to notice as my upgraded speakers and subwoofer prove to be a nice way to drown out the engine noise  Speaking of that  though  consider yourself warned if you plan on adding speakers or other upgrades  the contour isn t the easiest car to mess around with  Each of the 4 stock speakers are in the doors  none in the rear deck like most cars  which means taking the entire door apart to replace them  Routing wires and such is a bit of a pain as well  as Ford has chosen looks  i e  concealing screws and wires in very difficult to reach locations  over upgradability  For most people who don t bother tinkering with their car  or who relegate that task to the specialists  it shouldn t even be an issue Unfortunately  I can t give any hard info on reliability or long term performance  as I have only owned the car just less than three months  But in that time I have drove it regularly and its always performed as good or better than I expected  Gas mileage is good  but not great  however this is my first car so I have no basis of comparison  However  I d say its probably about the same as most other cars with a similar sized engine  in the 20 25 mpg range  the 30 mpg highway rating from Ford is probably a bit too optimistic The interior is quite comfortable  and the 8 way adjustable power driver s seat is a nice touch  a memory function would have been nice  though  The interior lighting is a little dim  the car would have benefitted from a centrally located  dome light  which I understand is on the Mystiques and may have been on older model Contours  Rear seats  as most have said  aren t the most spacious in the world  but I don t see them as much of a problem at all  Adults will definitely fit  although it may not be comfortable for very long drives  not really any different from just about any mid size car  though So  what are the real flaws  I haven t found any yet  besides the fact that Ford  and especially the Contour  doesn t have such a great reliability reputation  I haven t had any problems so far  however  and hope it ll stay that way  It s probably worth it  though  knowing that I saved a few thousand dollars over a same year import car  you know  those  reliable  Hondas and Toyotas  Watch out for that depreciation  though  while it means I was able to get a great deal on the car to start with  it also means I can t expect much a few years down the line when it comes time to sell it  It s a trade off I m willing to take  though So yes  the car has its flaws  As you can see  though  most of them are relatively minor  and overshadowed by the car s great performance and price  After reading up on probably dozens of other contenders  I ve come to the conclusion that just about ever car in this price range will have a host of minor flaws and negative points  The 1998 Ford Contour  of all the cars I have looked at  puts forth the best combination of looks  performance  and features with a minimal of problems for under  10 000
