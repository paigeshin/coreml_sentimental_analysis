  Captured by the styling b  I have to admit  we were captured by the appearance of the 2001 GT Convertible  As teenagers in the early 70 s  the stying is obviously a through back to that era  We love looks b Strong V8 b  Although I wouldn t want to race a 325 h p  Camero SS  the 260 h p  V 8 has an amazing amount of power  Ford must have also done their homework in producing the exhaust note of this engine  It has a beautiful  beefy sound under acceleration  but is quiet at steady speeds   Small but comfortable on the inside b  I am 6 1  and 230 lbs  but feel very much at home in the cockpit of the Mustang  One caveat though  if you opt for standard interior instead of the premium  the seats are much less comfortable  a least for a guy my size  Make sure to test both before deciding b Good fit and finish b  I have read less then favorable remarks about the fit and finish on the Mustang  However  I am very pleased  We own both a new style Camero and the Mustang  The Mustang seems to have more durable components in the cab then our Camero  Time will tell as we have only had the Mustang since June of 2001   Relatively poor gas mileage b  To date  I have only one minor complaint about the car it is thirsty  We average 16 miles to gallon in town  I guess we should have expected this  but I actually thought it might be closer to 20
