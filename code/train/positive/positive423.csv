 The new refined Mustang  quot GT quot  has its ups and downs  This car is very sleek and stylish with its redesigned interior and exterior  This car comes with a 4 6 liter V 8 that hd torque and agility of an American Sports car  The old 5 0 engine is missed because of its horespower and awsome sound but this new engine is doing real good for its smaller size  I like this car so much because its good looking and it drives like no other  I think it corners the best out of anything ive drivin  i also liked the manual transmission feel  i feel in control of the car at high speeds and low  The cost of this car is fairly reasonable for a car like this but kinda hard on the checkbook  The back seat is one of the downs because its too small for an adult to ride in its built for a smaller kid
