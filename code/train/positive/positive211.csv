 First I must point out that the estimated price for this car is wrong  I own one and the base price with no options starts at  26 390  Mine has every option except the leather which was a free option  but since I live in the heat and I hate hot leather on bare skin  I declined the leather  This car is made in very limited quantities of about 3000 per year and commands a particulary aggressive type of owner  The car runs a 13 9 second quarter mile in stock trim and is good for about 160 mile per hour top speed  I put the Vortech supercharger on mine the week I bought it as well as some aftermarket suspension parts from Steeda  This was easily the best money I spent on the car as it only continued to get better  Driving this car has got to be as fun as the owners of the original 1964 thought  because not only is it one of the best looking American made cars on the road today  but it is also one of the fastest  I have had it to the drag strip three times now and have run a 12 6 et 121 mph pass with the stock tires on the car and a full tank of gas  Now you motor heads out there do the math  At 3300 pounds that makes this car a 500 horsepower monster  The fastest stock production vehicle on the road today is a twin turbo Porsche 911 at  110 000  I own an American car that is a half a second faster at a mere savings of  75 000  now what could be wrong with that  But even better is the driveability and the mileage  On long freeway trips with the cruise control on I average 25 26 miles per gallon  thats 2 better then my wifes V6 Taurus  You will be hard pressed to find a more reliable car with this kind of performance  At 35 000 miles I have changed the oil and the spark plugs only  Thats it  No minor or major mechanical problems even with the aftermarket parts I have put on  This is indeed a fine example of American engineering and beauty  If you are looking at a used 97 or 98 Cobra  I would encourage you to buy quickly  This car is a very driveable rocketship  A Viper eating  Porsche embarrasing American made musclecar that is as beautiful as it is fun  Turns heads at every corner and the rear wheels at the drop of a hat  Every stoplight becomes an adventure and every gas stop becomes a conversation  This car never fails to turn heads and on the rare occasion that you see another one the freeway  you are gauranteed to see a waving hand and a smiling face I cant say enough about this car except that I would buy it again today  even at full price  It is worth every penny  Thank you FORD
