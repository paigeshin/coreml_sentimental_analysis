 I had a 1996 Ford Mustang GT  I say had  because the car was leased  I turned the car in because 1  driving a 5 speed in Chicago s traffic was driving me nuts  2  rear wheel drive during winter in Chicago is a horrible experience  and 3  my wife just had a baby and we needed more space Don t be mislead from the above statements  I loved this car  It had lots of power  It looked great  It took off from the starting line like a rocket ship  It took the corners like it was on rails  Overall  the Ford Mustang is just a fun car to drive  I must admit  however  that I was pleasantly surprised at the ride of this car  It was much smoother than previous models I had little to no problems with the car except for the front end alignment going out on me  What didn t I like  In 1996 Ford replaced the 5 0L engine with the 4 6L engine  The gas mileage isn t that great I have driven the Chevy Camaro  the Pontiac Firebird  and even the Chevy Corvette  I own a  72  and I would have to say that the Mustang is much more fun to drive than the Camaro or the Firebird  It not in the same league with the Corvette  but it is the next best thing Who should buy the car  Only people without children Who should not buy drive the car  Parents who s 16 year old kid just got his driver s license
