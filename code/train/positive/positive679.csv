 I bought my Focus hatchback in late November  1999  and I now have almost 10 000 miles on it  It s the only new car I ve ever bought that didn t have any  bugs  Everything is perfect  I handles so well  it rides nicely  gets decent gas mileage  and is very nimble   easy to park  I bought it because it was unusual looking  to tell the truth  The Honda Civic was my other choice  but that car hasn t changed much in the last 10 years especially the interior  I just wanted something that not many people had  and even a year later  I don t see many hatchbacks mostly sedans are running around in L A There are a few things that I would change  the side view mirrors stick out too far I ve almost caught them on the garage wall several times  I still haven t been able to spot the oil filter in the engine compartment so I take it to the dealer for oil changes  I liked the seat s back support a little better in the Civic Consumer Reports recently rated it as the best small car they ve tested even better than the Jetta  If  they  liked it  you know it s a good car  I think their one complaint was that the doors didn t automatically unlock when you turn off the car  Well  I would like to be the one who decides when to unlock the doors  What if you re in an iffy neighborhood  To wrap up you can t go wrong with this car  A note  the hatchback is built at Ford s factory in Hermosillo  Mexico  This plant has the highest quality output of all the Ford factories in North America  I can attest to the quality  as my car has no squeaks or rattles  The sedan and wagon are built in Wayne  Michigan  From what I ve heard  their quality is good too  but the Mexico factory has a better reputation I got the car for  125 over invoice   no doc fee at Crystal Ford in Silver Spring Maryland  Update  11 2002 Car now has 23 000 miles   still not a single problem  Really glad I bought this car  I read Consumer Reports   they say that the Focus isn t that reliable  but I think they must be talking about the sedan   wagon  I have no regrets   I think the hatchback would be a great used car for anyone
