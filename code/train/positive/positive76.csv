 We purchased a 1999 Ford F 150 in May of 1999  We bought the base model and added only the 60 40 seat  cruise control  and a cassette player  We bought the truck to serve as a reliable vehicle for me to commute to work in and for us to take long trips in  We kept the standard V 6 engine which works fine if you are towing a small trailor and reasonable loads  In fact  I have never run into a case where I needed a larger engine  but I am certain that towing a large trailor or heavy loads would tax the V 6  The manual transmission is great  and it shifts like a car  It is very forgiving  however  the clutch is stiff and could be difficult for someone with knee problems The truck handles the road very well in rain and snow  and I have only a couple of times wished for 4 wheel drive  We have traveled from NJ to La and from NJ to IL several times in the truck and it rides extremely well  There is plenty of room in the front seat  The rear seat on the other hand is not made for an adult to ride long distances in  We have put our two kids in the rear seat  and they seem happy  The 4th door makes putting a child into and removing a child from a car seat extremely easy  and a car seat fits perfectly behind either seat or in the middle of the rear seat  It is important to get measurements of the car seats though because some brands of car seats will not fit behind either seat  The bed of the truck is full sized so there is no problem hauling plywood unlike the new 4 door F 150s  I strongly recommend adding a topper  about  800 1200  since it greatly increases the utility and security of the goods you are hauling as well as nearly eliminating the disposing of garbage in the truck bed It is a difficult vehicle to enter so if you are going to have someone whose mobility is less than normal riding in the truck check to see how easy it is for them to enter and leave the cab  Whenever I drive my mother  I must give her a boost to get in and a hand out  Riding boards help but do not eliminate this problem  4 wheel drive makes this even worse Fuel economy is reasonable  I generally get 19 20 mpg normal use and about 21 22 on the highway  Overall it is a great truck for the price and a great vehicle to see the country in br br
