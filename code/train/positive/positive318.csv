 I purchased my new Windstar in August of 1999 from Bankston Ford in Frisco  Texas  I would recommend this vehicle to my best friend  Ford continues to put out the highest quality cars and trucks on the road  The Windstars safety record speaks for itself  My insurance went down  15 a month when I purchased it  trading in my 95 Dodge Van  My insurance agent was as happy as can be because the van comes factory equipped with a passive anti theft system  The ride is great  there is lots of room for my family and the gear that comes with two kids LOTS  If I had to do it all over again I would buy the exact same vehicle 10 times out of 10 If you are in the market for a van that the whole family will love  Ford has the van for you  I have the Windstar LX which is the middle of the line as far as accessories go and highly recommend it  The gas mileage is great for this big of a vehicle also  Go buy one and you will love it too br br
