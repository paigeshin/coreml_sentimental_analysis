 I bought an  86 crown victoria for less than one thousand dollars and it never ceases to amaze me  It s got a V8  a 5 liter engine  and over one hundred and fifty horse power  This car might be old but it can definitely kick some but  It has a great pick up I have ran into a couple of problems with this car including  windows not working  alternator not working  A C not cold enough  and some little minor problems  But the car is 14 years old and it is bound to have some problems  I have had the car for about 2 years now and I have only brought it into the shop twice  Most of the problems that occur with this car are minor things that can be fixed without taking it to the shop  I love this car  It is a tank  I don t have to worry about dying in a car wreck in this car  You could probably run into a brick wall at 50 miles per hour and still walk away  It isn t hard at all to park  and it has a great suspension system  The speakers weren t too good though so I got them replaced  ad I put in a CD player  Other than that everything about my  Vic is cool  I love this car  I am going to keep it until I die or until it quits on me  I don t know which will come first It has tons of space also  Good for long distances br br
