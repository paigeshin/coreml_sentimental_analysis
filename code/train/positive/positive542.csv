 We are stationed overseas in Okinawa Japan through the AirForce  We are used to driving old foreign junkers that we picked up for about  800 or less  just to last us through our tour and also allowed us to save some money  We decided that since we are leaving Okinawa for Hawaii or Guam  it was time to buy a new car for all of our hard work and sacrifice in paying off bills  Enter the debate Ford Escape   OR  Pontiac Aztec  Now some of you will immediately shout out  Ugghhh  NOT the Aztec  But I fell in love with the Aztec immediately  The amazing features and handling of that SRV are just so wonderful  and yes  I am one of the rare breeds that actually LOVE the styling of the Aztec  My husband on the other hand fell in love with the Escape  which I had to admit  was my first choice before spotting the Aztec  To make a long story short  we chose the Aztec  Don t get me wrong  I think the Escape is great vehicle  Which is why I decided to write this review after our test drive  If the Aztec is too out there for you  or if you just think it is ugly   Then I would definitly check out the Escape THE SHELL  This is a steel shell that protects the entire front end  and continues around the sides using  side intrusion door beams   steel beams along each and every door for protection in a crash  I have to young girls who sit in carseats on the outer back seats  and this feature makes me feel all warm and cozy inside  knowing that they are protected  Throw in the dual and side airbags  and I am on cloud nine  When I found out that the Aztec had this feature also  I was sold  otherwise it would have been the Escape When I drove the SUV  it was SOOOOOOO smooth  NO rattles whatsoever  It was peaceful  my kids were not inside at the time  lol  I felt that it accelerated super fast and powerful  but then again  I am not used to driving state of the art speed cars  Quite the opposite actually  If you are going from a Mustang  or some other sporty get up  then you may be disappointed  I sure wasn t  It cornered wonderfully  Those U turns we all need to make from time to time would be SOO easy  as the wheel turning radius  have no idea if I am using the right terminology  seems very tight  nice sharp turns  Parking was a breeze  as again  the wheel turning radius is nice and sharp  I felt no roll at all when making quick and fast turns  It did score a 3 star rating on the roll over resistance rating for both the 4 wheel drive and 2 wheel drive  This is the highest rating that SUV s have gotten  except for the Pontiac Aztec 4x4  4 door which scored a 4 out of 5 stars  the 2 wheel drive Aztec scored a 3  While there have not been any crash tests on the Ford Escape 4x2  the 4x4 has received excellent ratings  5 stars for the tests done on the front driver side  side drivers side and rear seats side  and 4 starts for the front passenger side test  This is awesome On a low note  I did feel that for the XLT model  the controls and front panels were a bit basic looking  Nothing high tech  but a small tradeoff for the superior safety you get from this SUV  Another thing that bothers me is the gas mileage which is supposedly around 19 24  But I knew this going in to an SUV  I guess if gas mileage is a big concern for you  then forget the SUV and opt for a sedan or passenger car  Another more minor detail that bothers me  With the XLT  you get the 6 disc in dash cd changer system  but only 4 speakers  It seams for such a large  larger than a car  vehicle with an upgraded sound system  they could at least throw in a few more speakers  You can get the 7 speaker system added on  but for about  600 more  Sheesh  On the Aztec  6 speaker is standard I believe  with also some speakers in very back for tailgating usage  Some other feature that the Aztec has that I think would be nice on the Escape are as follows 1  HUD  heads up display  projects speed and other info onto the lower windshield so you can always see it without taking eyes off the road  Come on Ford  add that on the Escape 2 Acceleration volume control  made that term up to  lol  as your speed increases  the volume on your stereo slightly elevates  and visa versa as speed decreases 3 Power outlets in rear of vehicle  Aztec has outlets in the rear  for use during camping  cleaning  etc  Just a nice touch 4 Stereo controls on the steering wheel  I want that  man Oh  and also  the price I was quoted is from the AAFES Military car sales  If you are military  I highly suggest that you check out your AAFES dealership before considering another dealership  Great experience  The only options that I did not get with my price were 1 leather seats  2 the side stepping bar  I did get the Choice XLT model  higher than the Value  and lower than Sport  but did not want Sport anyhow   Thanks for reading my review  I am not a car professional  but wanted to comment on these 2 vehicles in a safety comparison  Good luck in your SUV purchase  I am also writing a review for the Aztec  so check it out if you are interested GOOD LUCK
