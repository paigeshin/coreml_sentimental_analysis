 My boyfriend owns a 1992 Ford Ranger and he loves it  He generally has bad luck with cars  and after his second car  a mustang  broke down  he decided it was time for a new car  I begged him to purchase a truck  because I think they are great  When he pulled up in his green truck  I fell in love  It is so nice  It has a nice sized bed and is perfect for those people who do not need a full sized car or a huge truck  It has nice pick up and is pretty fast  It has never given him any problems  It handles good in the rain or snow  This is a perfect truck for teens and people without families or people with one child  I said that this truck is very roomy  even in back  because there is no option that says   quot Very roomy  no back seat quot
