 I have leased a 1998 Contour GL for 2 years and will have to decide whether to buy or lease it or another car in October so I have been thinking about the car a lot  My model is a 4 door  4 cylinder automatic  with cruise  pw  a c  It has been an excellent car  no trouble for 23 000 miles  It handles very well  and I haven t seen the need for the available larger engine  though all the pro reviewers say the 6 cylinder larger engine is smoother  I used to have a BMW 325  and this car s handling is not as good as that  but it is better than my Audi 100  for example  I know that the Accord gets better reviews but I just cant complain about this car  It is quiet  and trunk space is excellent  the space in front is fine  Rear is not huge but ok for kids or short trips with adults br
