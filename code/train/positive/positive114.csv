 In 1992 I bought my daughter a new Ford Explorer with a promise from her that I drive it until she started college a year later  When she started to college she took the Explorer with her and I drove another car  She drove the Explorer until 1999 when she purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang  I sold the car I was driving at the time and took back the Explorer  So you can see why I entitled this  quot Recycled Explorer quot We had problems with vibrations from the beginning  which I understand was a problem with most 1992 Explorers  The dealer from which I bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims  That didn t work and I ve been told that they should not have done this  This is the only major complaint we ve had with the car  Obviously  it was not so big a deal that we sold the vehicle  It now has 103 000 miles on and still going strong  We have had to replace the anti lock brake system and I recently had the rotors replaced  but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect br br
