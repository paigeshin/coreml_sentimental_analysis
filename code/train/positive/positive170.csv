 My husband Jeff is a contractor that travels all over the country  Up until December of 1999 he did this in a very large  very old  very unsafe Ford passenger van  I knew he had been looking around for a used vehicle to pull his 20 foot cargo trailer around the country with  then one day I got a call from him  He was in Chicago and he had just test drove a brand spanking new 2000 F350 dually  He immediately fell in love with it  It was a long bed 4x4 with a powerstroke diesel  The dealership even let him hook up his trailer for the test drive  After much haggling  he finally got the price down from  42 000 to  36 000  He then filled out the credit application and headed home then told me about his little adventure  but that s another story  He got the call a couple of days later to come pick up his shiny new truck  so he back off to Chicago Of course  from the beginning  I held a grudge and hated everything about this truck  I was a  530 payment we didn t really need  it was brand new  and with the amount of miles he drives  I just knew it was a bad investment to buy a new vehicle  And it was big  Extremely big  But Jeff convinced me that it was much safer for him than the old van  and that the diesel engine would last a very long time  Slowly but surely this truck that I had deemed so evil started to grow on me  Of course it was hard to get used to driving this monster vehicle after driving my 1997 Ford Taurus for the past year and a half  but I soon mastered it  Soon  I grew to love this truck more than my trusty taurus  The Powerstroke Diesel is much quieter than the Cummins that Dodge and Chevy use  and it has more power  so when you re pulling a 20 foot trailer loaded down with shingles  carpet and linoleum the truck doesn t lurch  It also doesn t use any more fuel than it normally would without the trailer  The Powerstroke is reliable  and the transmission behind it very strong  Being in the construction business  my husband knows many guys with different trucks  and many of these guys have had their trucks in the shop several times getting work done on their Alison trannies  Any down time on your truck in this business is a week without a paycheck  so we appreciate the dependability of the Ford  But there are times  although few and far between  that my husband isn t on the road and we use the truck to haul friends and family instead of a trailer  The width and length of the crew cab makes the interior enormous  We have had 6 adults in the truck and there was still plenty of room to stretch out  The crew cab was made for just that  a crew  The folks at Ford did a wonderful job of designing the interior of the cab  In addition to being roomy  it offers plenty of adjustable cup holders  front and back seats  extra power outlets  and storage  Any road noise and diesel noise is deadened inside the truck  The seats are very comfortable and the design is ergonomic  which is extremely important when you drive up to 16 hours a day to get across the country  When Jeff bought the truck  it had 52 miles on it  Now  a year later  it has over 65 000  and over 50 000 of those miles have been pulling a trailer  We have not had any hint of trouble so far  and have never done anything but regular maintenance and tire changes on it  Of course  regular maintenance is a bit more expensive than on my little Taurus  which only takes 5 qts of oil  but the longevity of the diesel will be worth it  This truck is very practical for anyone that has many people to haul around  for people that pull trailers or RV s  or just desires a strong truck to do everyday chores such as pulling large stumps  helping stranded motorists  or hauling heavy loads  The only thing I don t like about the truck is the fact that for in town use  going to the grocery store and such  the sheer size of it makes parking very difficult  and it may catch a few curbs in town while going around corners  Make sure you re ready for that before you purchase it  But all around  this is a well thought out  powerful truck that still rides smooth and will last a very  very long time
