 I have the 98 Mustang GT and much prefer the rear end style so I was glad I didn t wait for the 99 to come out  The car over all is a great car and a lot of fun to drive  The only complaint I have had is that the gearbox is very tight compared to other car I have driven which initially was very frustrating The car handles very well and looks exceptionally sharp on the road  If you like to drive on windy roads  I highly recommend the standard VS  automatic for the fun of maneuvering all those curves  Top down or up  this car is a lot of fun to drive over the coast highway and draws a lot of attention  Mileage at 18 25 mpg is certainly acceptable for a high performance car Even adding the luxury of leather seats  a high performance sound system  and 16 inch wheels  the price is well under  30K The down side is lack of comfort in the back seat for passengers and limited trunk space  Headspace is tight especially if you are tall  but over all this is a very sharp car br br
