 My husband and I were looking for a new vehicle our first  and decided on a Ford Escort  The price was right between eleven and twelve thousand dollars  and the four doors are appropriate for a family of four  The back seat fits 2 car seats  but not much else  Trunk space is great if you are going on a nearby vacation or camping somewhere  It fits a stroller  diaper bag  and other baby supplies beautifully  Driving is smooth  but the passengers feel all bumps  The one thing I really dislike about my car is the engine noise is extremely loud  You hear every little shift and brake the car makes  One of the bonuses though is the power brakes  steering  windows and doors  There is expandable leg room for the front  and the bucket seats also recline  I really feel this car is great in price  size  and comfort for new parents  I love to drive my car  and with 2 kids  everything seems to fit well into the trunk for long trips to the grocery store or Grandma s house
