 I d only driven Chevy products until recently  I considered myself a die hard Chevy person  Then my mom got a new Ford Ranger SuperCab  I went to New York to visit her and wound up  having  to drive her truck while I was there  I mean she really had to twist my arm I was pretty astounded  I d never thought myself to be a truck girl  but I fell in love with this Ranger  It s a 1999 Cherry Red Ranger  fully loaded with CD player  electric everything  etc  The ride is incredibly smooth  and it has all the comforts of home If you re looking for a manly truck  this isn t for you  It s definitely more accomodating  with easy to use features and lots of gadgets  The SuperCab is helpful as well  as my mother has 3 children still at home  She drove from Illinois to New York with 2 adults and 2 children  all of their  quot stuff quot  and my new living room set with no problems  no cramping  etc  Plus  it s still stylish and fun to drive I took it off roading on the back roads in upstate New York  and it has quite of bit of pick up and go  With all of it s power and superior handling  I still wasn t overwhelmed  I m 5 3 quot  and weigh 110 lbs on a good day  so needless to say  I m used to driving really little cars  Chevy Cavalier  so I thought I d freak out having to drive a truck Not at all I highly recommend this truck for anyone who wants a fun  handy little truck br br
