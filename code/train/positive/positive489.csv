 I ve owned my 95 Probe for almost 5 years now  and what a cheap 5 years it has been  This car has not given me a single problem  They get great gas mileage  meaning around 25 to 27 mpg  so don t worry about having to fill it up every other 3 or 4 days cause these cars will go for weeks  It s a sporty little car  so it s very fun to drive  too  The main thing you have to consider  though  when buying a 95 Probe is the mileage  Little cars with little engines like these could last anywhere from 90 000 to 200 000 miles  You would definitely want to have the engine checked out before buying it to make sure that s its got a lot of life left in it  The only thing I would say would be an inconvenience with this car is that when something does break  it s not fun to fix it  Once  I broke my key off in the ignition  don t ask how  and we had to put a whole new ignition in because it was one solid piece  rather than broken down into smaller parts that are easier to replace  Ford has a funny way of doing things sometimes  but aside from that  they put together a VERY solid and fun vehicle when they made the Probes  I don t know why they stopped making them  but they re great cars and definitely worth every penny
