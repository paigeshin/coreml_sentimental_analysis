 I know this probably seems strange that I am writing this opinion instead of my husband but I love this truck  When I was 7 months pregnant with our second child my husband decided that we need a family car  I know this does not seem like a family car but it is used as our family car and I would not have it any other way  Why did we choose the Ford F150 SuperCab  First I have to say that my husband choose this vehicle  It would not had been my first choice  My first choice was the Ford Explorer  In the long run I am glad that my husband did not listen to me  I love driving this truck  It is so easy to drive  One of the main reasons we chose this truck is because my husband needed a large motor to pull his 19ft Wellcraft Open Fisherman four hours away from our home  That is a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle  The second reason my husband chose the Ford F150 is the size of it  It has a big bed for transporting items  As you already know if you have children  especially infants  that they require a lot of extra equipment when traveling  This was perfect  We could stuff all of the items in the back of the truck  So you are probably wondering what did we do when it rained  No we do not have top to it  We simply put tarps over the items we kept in the back  This seemed to do the trick Why do I like the Ford F150  I will admit at first I didn t like the truck  It did take some getting use to  First  it was really big and bulky  I can remember trying to park at the local store in town  I think all of the other people knew when I was coming because the parking lots were empty except for a few cars  Here I am in my big white Ford F150 trying to park  Can you only imagine  I know if my husband saw me during those first few months he would had probably banned me from driving the truck  So what did I do  Until I felt comfortable with parking next to cars and other trucks I would pick a parking space as far away as possible so I would not hit anyone  Okay men  you can laugh  Let s get serious about why I like the Ford F150 SuperCab  It is easy to drive  I like being up high where I can see everything while driving  If you are short like I am this is a nice feature  It gets decent gas mileage for a large engine  I believe it has a V8 or V6 in it  We get about 18 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the interstate  I feel safe in the big truck  We have actually tested out how safe our truck  My husband does a lot of hunting and you can only imagine what our first wreck was  While driving out in the country near my husband s hunting grounds a deer jumped in the window  Yes  you read that right  Unbelievable the truck only received a major blow to the passenger door and front window  We even drove the vehicle home that night  So I feel safe about Ford  Of course we had those unmentionable Firestone tires  Don t get me started on it  If you would like to read my review on Firestone Tires just look for Firestone Almost killed my family by davelaura  That will give you some idea how I view the tires that Ford uses on their vehicles  I don t approve of them  How do I feel when I drive my Ford F150  No  I don t feel like a redneck  I feel like myself  I love driving this truck and would not drive any other vehicle except maybe a Mercedes but I know that will never happen  Does the truck drive smooth on the open road  We do a lot of traveling and it is one of the smoothest vehicles I have been in  I used to drive a Volvo 760 and I would say this truck is almost has smooth as the car  Maybe I am pushing the truck a little too much  Are the seats comfortable  I will admit after four hours in the truck I do get a little cranky but who wouldn t after that long of a drive  Overall the truck is really comfortable and very roomy  I am sorry men if this doesn t help you but maybe it will help convince your wives why you need a truck  I was about to kill my husband when he purchased the truck  Now I love him for it
