 Right now I am a year and a half into my second Windstar and couldn t be happier with it  I leased a  95 Windstar and returned it after the lease was up  I would have loved to have purchased it but financially it just wouldn t work Because of the good luck I had with the  95 when I was in the market in  98 I bought another Windstar  Even with all the hype surrounding the redesigned Dodge I felt the Windstar was still the only minivan that didn t drive like a truck  The Windstar felt and handled like a larger car  The only thing I didn t really like is the front end design  The grille work and lights make the van look  quot unhappy quot  Look at it and you ll see With the facelift the  00 received and the addition of another sliding door the Windstar has just gotten better Recommendations  Definitely get the V6  you will need the power Two minor annoyances  The cupholders for the front are not too sturdy  One of mine broke already  The sensors for the sliding door are very sensitive  They give false readings that the door is not closed all the way br br
