 The Ford Contour  a driver s car for the rest of us  For under  20 000  here is a domestic sedan that can keep up with the entry level offerings from Germany  The Contour s driving behavior is comparable to the Audi A4  Volkswagen Jetta  and BMW 323i  What these models have over the Contour are uprate interiors of fancy plastics and bank vault feel as well as brand panache  better resale and superior available mechanicals  like Audi s Quattro and BMW s sporty rear wheel drive  But if you can t come up with  25 000 30 000  you don t have to settle for an garden variety Accord  Altima or Grand Am  Unlike many inexpensive cars  the Contour has a playful yet composed personality and is more than willing to be your curvy back road eating friend My Contour is a 1998 5 SE Sport model with the 2 5L Duratec V6 and the MTX 75 5 speed manual transmission  The Sport trim level added features like alloy wheels  the V6  spoiler  fog lamps  leather wrapped wheel shifter  floor mats  My car also features leather trimmed seating and a power  sliding moonroof  Since I had to take delivery on a car from a dealer lot to get cheap  0 9 60 months  Ford financing  I didn t get all the options I wanted  It is difficult to find the Contour in the V6 5spd form  at least in my urban location  Other options I wanted as well but could not find on a lot were ABS  traction control and a split  folding rear seat The Duratec V6 is one of the Contour s greatest assets  It s not a perfect engine and some close competitor s engines are arguably better  like VW s 2 8L VR6  but the Duratec helps elevate the Contour from a Tempo replacement to something unexpected for an inexpensive domestic compact sedan  It loves to rev  It makes sweet mechanical music  It doesn t wheeze or sound stressed  It pulls all the way to the fairly high redline of 6750 rpm  Mid range torque is excellent for this class  Tasks like passing and highway merging are relaxed  fun  when you have the Duratec  The power the Duratec generates surprises other drivers in their 200hp V6 mid size sedans  It also surprises the college kids in their Integras as you pull away from them  I wouldn t necessarily call a V6 equipped Contour FAST  but it is certainly spirited  What limits the Duratec s appeal is a lack of low end torque and an unrefined transition when the secondaries kick open at 3500rpm  Some people LIKE the kick from the engine at 3500rpm  However  after driving German V6s  I prefer a smooth build up of power  not an abrupt one  But the kick is part of the engine design  not a problem  and helps give the Contour a little edge  a little personality  Overall  the Duratec is similar to a Honda VTEC engine albeit with less refinement and turbine smoothness  but with a more workable powerband One of the best things about the Contour is the availability  actually it s standard  of a 5 speed manual transmission with the base 4cyl engine AND the Duratec V6  You can t get a V6 5spd on the Accord  Grand Prix Regal Intrigue  Galant  Altima  Malibu or Grand Am Alero  The Contour s manual transmission is easy to use  The shifter is of the notchy variety  While most enthusiasts prefer the rubbery feel of BMW s stick shift  the notchiness makes it easy to find the Contour s gears  The clutch is fairly strong and relatively easy to engage  It doesn t require much pressure and isn t as  quot spring loaded quot  as some other clutches  The Contour is my first stick shift car and I found it a very good candidate to learn on   Honda s manuals are probably the best for novices  As any car geek will tell you  a manual transmission allows you to have real fun with a car  The 5spd transmission allows you to keep the Duratec in its powerband for passing and for turns  Together  they make the Contour a reason to get up in the morning If horsepower and flat out acceleration were everything  I d be driving a Camaro Z28 with its 305 hp 5 7L V8  But as I ve said before  the Contour is a driver s car  not a stoplight racer  What allows the Contour to be compared to the German models is its grasp of the driving fundamentals  handling  steering  brakes  You can throw the Contour around  It s easy to brake before a turn and control the car through the turn with throttle  There is moderate  but predictable understeer  The steering is very communicative and adjusts its attitude over various speeds  At low speeds  you can feel imperfections in the road and anything that might get you in trouble  It is also responsive  At fast highway speeds  the steering is appropriately heavy and not twitchy  The suspension feels very European  The ride is supple  though some American drivers will find it too harsh  Since I am in my 20s  I don t care so much about ride as I do about handling  Unless you buy a world class car like the BMW 740i  you have to make a compromises between ride and handling  A base SE or LX will have a smoother ride than my SE Sport  but with lower roadholding limits  The Contour has a very reassuring pose that rewards spirited driving  Body roll is present  though not a problem and is a bit better controlled than others in this class  Steer the Contour through an emergency maneuver and the car stays planted to the road  After a sudden move  the car regains composure quickly and waits for your next input  Although the Contour may not be loaded with the latest  quot safety feature of the month quot  I consider its excellent driving mannerisms a big safety feature  The Contour s brakes are very good  a result of a nice  progressive pedal feel and a system that stops the car straight and short  The brakes have a good bite that may surprise you if you are used to the weak stuff GM makes All these qualities add up to a car you ll probably drive just for the heck of it  You ll want to find those little used back roads to play on  I ve taken my car out for a few drives where I try to nail it to redline  take turns at high speeds and  of course  develop a very brisk pace  The car is very stable at 90mph and I have managed to take it to 108  At that point  I feel like my driving ability is at its limit  rather than the car  Even after a tiring day of play  the engine and brakes maintain their performance  This car has high limits  If you don t typically drive in a spirited fashion  you ll still appreciate the Contour s driving competence  It produces few  if any  surprises and the reassurance it provides might make you pick up your pace a little bit  likely without you realizing it The Contour is America s 3 series  It has a real enthusiast s engine  a proper manual transmission  a suspension that grips the road well  steering that communicates and brakes that stop without incident  It is NOT a 3 series equal  however  and I do not consider my car an apple for apple replacement of a BMW  For instance  the Contour is front wheel drive  while all BMWs have rear wheel drive  BMWs have better refinement and higher limits  BUT we aren t talking about a  30 000 car here  a nicely equipped 323i  You can t reasonably expect a  17 000 car to equal a  30 000 one  And the Contour doesn t  Rather  the Contour gives you the best version of German engineering of any American Asian car under  25 000  That includes the Intrigue  The toughest argument against the Contour is the VW Jetta  The Jetta certainly has a better interior by far and its VR6 engine is a real thrill  But it costs thousands more  doesn t handle as crisply and has a meager 2yr 24K bumper to bumper warranty  On paper  the Jetta appears to be a winner  but since you can get the Contour near invoice whereas the Jetta goes near sticker  the battle lines blur From a practicality perspective  the Contour is less impressive  though still capable  The trunk is fairly large and has much usable space  Entry exit is easy from the front seats  though the much scorned back seat has room for improvement  It s tight back there and I can t imagine having 3 adults sit there anymore than a very short distance  Since I am single  I use the back seat floor as a way to convenient way to haul groceries and other items  they roll around in the trunk  Visibility is good from the front and sides  though the rear view is a little abbreviated  The dashboard has a simple design and buttons are easy to locate  However  the stereo is too low in the dash  The front cupholders are possibly the most pathetic feature in the car  They can t hold anything  I really like the appearance of the instrumentation   crisp and easy to read  However  I can t stand the econocar plastic that abounds in the interior  VW does a much better job in this aspect and I wish Ford would give the Contour better feeling and looking plastics  The door panels in the Contour are completely plastic   there should be a cloth leather insert  The seats are comfortable and although they don t have an adjustable lumbar  there is plenty of lower back support for long drives  Since I drive the Contour in a spirited fashion  I wish the seats would hug you a little better  The Contour s heating and cooling systems are first rate  Although they have the old fashioned hot cold dials  not an actual temperature setting  the heater puts out tons of heat and the AC can be downright icy Regrettably  the Contour can t completely shed its American car reliability stereotype  In 15 months  I have had 4 warranty claims  The first was to replace a strip of trim on the roof  The second was to fix a wiring harness behind the headlight switch  The third was to fix a heater blower resistor assembly  The fourth was to replace faulty insulation in the front bumper crash sensors  The last three were official Ford recalls   ADDENDUM 12 17 1999  The number may become 5  I read in AutoWeek that 1998 Contours are being recalled for frayed accelerator cables  All of these claims are troubling  but I don t know what to make of it  Having 5 warranty claims in the first 16 months of ownership would suggest the car is a junker or lemon  However  my Contour really hasn t let me down  The warranty repairs themselves haven t been major in scope  the dealer has been able to make the repairs the same day  Also  Ford has been the one making the recalls  I haven t had to bring my car into the dealer for problems that I ve found myself  I suppose I can put up with these issues simply because I love the way the Contour drives and since it HAS been reliable  However  I think I will be looking for another car after the 36 000 mile warranty expires  That s a shame To be honest  I was scared to buy the Contour because I feared it might be a repair nightmare  I was driving a 1997 Honda Civic at the time  which had not given me any problems in 19K of driving  I was used to the stereotype that Japanese cars drive forever but American cars are Fixed Often Rarely Driven  I got over my  probably misfounded  fears and bought the Contour  using the fact it had a fresh warranty as an excuse  Although my Contour hasn t been flawless in the defect department  I don t worry about it breaking down on me  It may not be a Toyota Corolla  but it is a reasonably well made car  I ve taken it on many trips  including a cross country one  without incident  From what I have read from others  the Contour is no Ford Tempo and bests the poor reliability history of the Stratus and Malibu Other areas of interest  I m not happy with the fuel economy  fetching 20mpg in suburban driving and a max of 26mpg on the interstate  My heavy right foot is partially to blame  but the thirstiness is made worse because of the smallish fuel tank  14 5 gallons  Fortunately  the Duratec happily drinks regular  87 octane gas  The stock tires   Firestone Firehawks   aren t performance tires and limit the car s performance abilities  The headlights are abysmal  I find myself using the high beams a lot  Cabin noise is unremarkable on the highway  with some wind and tire noise protruding  but nothing out of the ordinary  There is a convenient storage space for CDs in the center console  though the right driver armrest can get in the way While the Contour as a complete package is flawed  so is the competition  What makes me  and others  such fans of the car is its remarkable driving behavior  You just can t get this kind of performance and joy from any other sub 20K sedan  The Contour is a reasonable choice   it is functional  inexpensive to insure and operate  not a theft target  comfortable  fairly stylish and is reasonably priced  Unless you have a growing family  the car should accommodate all of your passengers in reasonable comfort  The Contour s last model year will be 2001 as it is being replaced by the new  and excellent  Focus  That s a shame because Ford has a real winner here  one that can be made great with some reworking and refinement FINAL NOTE  While I recommend the Contour with the V6 and 5spd options  I do not recommend the car with the 4cyl Zetec AND the automatic transmission  This drivetrain takes all of the life out of the car  If you need an automatic  stick with the V6  If you can drive stick  the 4cyl Zetec is an acceptable  and economical  choice br br
