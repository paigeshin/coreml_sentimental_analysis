 I bought my Eddie Bauer Edition of the Ford Explorer a little over a year ago and I love it more every day  This was purchased to replace an older car and a lot of thought was given to the SUV vs car dilemma  I opted for the SUV for the flexibility it offered ie hauling moving things without having to rent a truck  camping  etc I really love the luxury of the Eddie Bauer Edition  The leather interior  great factory sound system  nice lines shape  It is wonderful to be able to see over traffic and not feel  quot boxed in quot  by larger vehicles  When I ride in a car now  I really feel like I m dragging on the ground  There are a couple of downsides that I wasn t really aware of  but can live with  They are that unless you are riding in the drivers seat  it can feel like a fairly rough ride and when the streets are slick  it does tend to slide more than a car  This is controlled by just slowing down a little more than you might on normal street conditions safer anyway  This is one of the best purchases I ve ever made and definitely the best vehicle purchase of my life  I will most surely be a repeat buyer br br
