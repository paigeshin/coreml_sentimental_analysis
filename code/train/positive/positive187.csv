 I am a big Ford fan and I have done some serious research on the new 2001 Ford Ranger  I learned that Ford has come up with a new trim package called the Edge that falls between XL and XLT packages  With this extra package a customer now has much more options to choose from  With this new package  Ford is adding special features in hopes to satisfy the needs for the young and active customer   quot What makes the Edge Ranger so different from other Rangers quot  you might ask  Well  to start off the 2 wheel drive Edge has the same amount of ground clearance as the 4 wheel drive Ranger  This feature allows customers to have the 4x4 looks without the high prices  Fog lamps  bed rail protectors  and front tow hooks are equipt as well  Air conditioning and a cd player also come standard in the Edge package with a 6 disk changer optional  The 3 0 liter engine comes standard in 2 wheel drive with your choice of regular cab or super cab and style side bed or flare side bed  I currently own a 2000 Trailhead Ranger that shares many of the same features as the Edge  including the 4x4 look  I am completely satisfied with the power and performance that it provides  Although the 4x4 lifted look causes a slightly rougher ride  it is well worth it just to have the  quot BUILT TOUGH quot  look that it has br br
