 I needed a vehicle with enough room to seat 4 people  2 in car seats  Four doors was something of a must as the extra 2 doors help to make the process of buckling in youngsters go a little smoother  I also wanted something that would be easy on gas as I do a lot of driving  My search did not start out with the Focus in mind  rather I looked at and test drove most of the cars in its class before making a decision  The main selling point for us on this vehicle was the test drive  The car surprised me at how quiet it is and the ride was also good for a small car  Gas mileage on the sticker was posted as 28 city  and 36 highway  The only thing I was not impressed with on the test drive was the visibility but I ll get to that later  A quick check to see how the car seats fit in the back and the rest was a matter of settling on a final price with our local dealer  After owning the Focus for about a month I am still very happy with my choice but there are a few gripes I have with this vehicle  The exterior styling of the sedan version leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion but also contributes to two shortcomings  I can t see the front end of the car nor can I see the back end  from the drivers seat  Pay close attention to this on the test drive as it may prove to be unacceptable to some drivers  The base engine is adequate for the flat terrain where I live but I d opt for the stronger Zetec option if I lived in a hilly or mountainous region  I would also have preferred an extra inch of cleaning surface on the drivers side windshield wiper  One thing to keep in mind when car shopping in this class is the list of standard options  I believe Ford was a little stingy in this respect  Aside from floor mats  rear defrost  interior trunk release  passive anti theft system and AM FM cassette most of the other standard options on the LX sedan are very basic  If you want ABS  AC  automatic transmission  etc  you ll need to add potentially expensive options  Fortunately the gripes have been mild and my overall impression remains high  The 5 speed transmission and clutch have proven thus far to be the smoothest I have used  The car does not have a workmanship defect that I have found and has not needed any repair  The mixed bag of driving I do has yielded almost 32mpg  Driving position is comfortable and the air conditioner has been more than up to the job  According to our insurance agent rates for this vehicle are pretty much average for a small car  As a final bonus the trunk holds more than I expected from a car in this class although the high trunk probably contributes to the lack of rear visibility  If you re in the market for a small car you ll of course want to check out epinions com but might also want to take a look at http carpoint msn com homepage default asp You can check specs  rebate information  pricing  invoice and retail  check safety ratings  compare with similar vehicles  etc
