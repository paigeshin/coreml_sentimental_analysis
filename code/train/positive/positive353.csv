 I know my limitations  My knowledge about automobiles is practical and every day  rather than research and engineering  I hate popping up the hood looking at the engine and I can t tell a cam from a ham  However  I m sure I ll be just as happy with my 2000 Ford Taurus as I was with my first two  If you re looking for a mechanical  high tech  motor minded review of the Taurus  stop right here  However  if you re interested on why I love my Ford Taurus  please read on I have always been happy with my Taurus for three reasons  Service and reliability  safety  and My Wallet  I always have had a 60 000 mile lease on the Taurus  With my first two  my only  quot major quot  expense in over 120 000 combined miles was a small  engine part  less than  100  I do follow the service manual for maintenance  relying on my friendly Ford dealer in Franklin  Wisconsin  for repairs and support  with reasonable  competitive rates  The manual says take it in at 25 000 for this this and this  I take it in  This system works for me  I might save a dollar or two by going to a quick lube place for an oil change  but the peace of mind is worth going to the experts  Plus  they keep an on line historical record of what maintenance has been done  Ford has implemented a  quot Personal Safety Package quot  for the 2000 Taurus  This includes  quot smart quot  air bags and deployment  side crash bars  and especially important  child safety seat anchors  If you ever lost a wrestling match with the back seat seat belt  trying to connect your kiddie seat  this offers ease of installation and added safety against shifting  Front Wheel Drive is a must in the midwest  as even in May  a snow storm can hit and make driving dangerous  FWD  as technical as I can get  gives me the additional traction necessary for safer driving  The interior is very roomy for driving  plenty of head and leg room  The bucket seats are comfortable  and the console is easy to use  The trunk is more than adequate for your needs  All this allows you a pleasant driving experience relating to a safer drive As for the wallet factor  as I mentioned  little or no major repairs  just routine maintenance  My gas mileage has ranged from 31  mph to 25 mph  The power to reach top speed is there when necessary  freeway ramps  etc  The Taurus is not a gas guzzler by any means The lease cost has always been competitive  with prices compared to other similar competing models and dealers  But why mess with a good thing  I have a winner  so stay with it  There s a reason why the Taurus has been one of the top three selling models in America  All three of my Tauruses  Tauri  have been reliable  roomy  maintenance free  fairly stylish  and economical br br
