 I have a 19 year old vehicle which needs to be retired  I looked for something to replace it with  At the time there was not much around which really qualified  And along came the Excursion  with a king size price tag to go with it But everything else filled the bill  Size  comfort  capability and everything else I could ask for  Fuel mileage is tolerable at about 18 20 mpg  imp  This is not much different than the 1998 explorer  17mpg on a good day  which we traded in for the Excursion  Ha Handling takes a bit to get used to  but once you get on to what to expect  its an absolute darling Parking is initially a real experience  It takes practice  before you go shopping or towing Its nice to have a large fuel tank so you don t have to keep looking for pit stops I checked out the cost of the recommended oil for the diesel and its not much more than what I had to pay before  The oil filter is a behemoth but still not extraordinarily expensive Ford provides lots of descriptive literature in the owners manual and also provides a manual for the 7 3L Power Stroke The back up beeper works as advertised  It starts beeping at about 5 something feet from an object  The sensors are susceptible to ice snow  and dirt so you have to keep them clean Cant find any squeaks  rattles or other annoying noises to complain about Lots of people seem to be complaining about roll in the corners but to them I say  slow down and take the corner intelligently according to what you are driving and you will find that there ain t no roll Speaking of roll  there is no binding on the discs so when you take your foot off the brake  the vehicle will roll very easily from a dead stop The Excursion is not for the faint of heart nor just for the rich and famous  Its a well built beast and will work as advertised and last a long long time  Fix or repair daily applies of course since any vehicle requires proper maintenance on a regular schedule  Treat it right and you can t loose on this one br br
