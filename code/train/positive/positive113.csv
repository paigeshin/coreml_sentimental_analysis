 Our family purchased our 1992 Explorer XLT in March 2000 from a good friend of ours who had to move across the world  We knew the car had been impeccably taken care of so it was an offer we couldn t pass up After driving around in the Explorer for a few days  I soon discovered a new dimension of driving   seeing the road ahead  Now I rarely go out to drive my father s car   I feel like my rear end is dragging on the road In XLT trim  the Explorer fits anyones requirements for a vehicle  The bright beige interior is showing little sign of wear  the leather seating is slightly torn on the drivers seat  near a seam on the bottom  after 100 000 town hopping miles  a slight tear is much less than to be expected  Ours came with 6 way power seats for both front passengers with lumbar and bolster for the driver and just lumbar for the passenger  they re still supportive and comfortable  The rear seat is like new   the only thing   on bumpy roads  the springs in the rear seat squeak  The rear cargo area is very durable  with a thick  padded carpet  The cargo cover still operates and provides added safety and privacy  The nicely equipped instrument panel is still fully operational as is the radio cassette player  Occasionally a tape will jam  probably needs greasing up again  Also  the center storage area has two large cupholders and a huge storage area for cassettes and underneath the cassette holder there is an area for CDs or other stuff Exterior treatments are shiny and the chrome glistens in the daylight  The factory tint or  privacy glass  is handy in high summer and really sets off the deep forest green exterior with the beige interior  The aluminum wheels are shiny but the lacquer covering was chipped on the edges following the Firestone tire recall   bad mechanic procedures  I simply repainted it with regular lacquer and they re fine again The 4 0L V 6 purrs every time it is started and never has hesitated and can pull me away from a stoplight with pleasant acceleration  It also comes in handy when pulling boats out of slips   even without a 4X4 system  it s still quite a capable vehicle  The ride overall is well controlled and with accurate inputs  the turns can be made so you don t feel like you re gonna fall out the car Shortly after we purchased it  the freon in the A C system leaked out  Where the car is located  you can still purchase R 12 from retailers so I filled it up again with a can or two only to have it gone in a few weeks time  I have since abandoned repair until I can find myself a R 134a conversion kit with some leak stopper where I live Recently  a few other things have cropped up that are slightly annoying  Inside the power window motors are three plastic cogs which slip anytime a finger or something gets in between the window  But   you can see this one coming  the plastic wears away over time and now the motor just sits there spinning around with no window movement  A good Ford dealer told me to replace these with metal washers which have indeed done the trick Next  the muffler has begun to break down  First  the tail end of the pipe started to crumble and now both silencing boxes are on the slippery slope of corrosion  I ll have to get this fixed soon Finally  the latest issue has been the paint  The car is in the Bahamas and the roof and the hood basically point to the sun and bake for hours on end  The clear coat on top finally broke away leaving bare base coat  In a hurry to preserve the steel panels of the car I had it repainted and it looks lustrous again  The doors and fenders  i e   anything that doesn t face the sun  were left with the original paint and are really shiny UPDATE  The AM FM Cassette unit which came standard died in the summer of 2003  After a little research I found out the Ford AM FM CD players can be substituted with no wiring changes  Then  I hunted eBay for a few months until I saw an early 90 s unit which would fit the  92 dash  I eventually found one  plugged it in and it is fabulous If you re interested in making this change  the radio removed was Ford base part 19B165  the radio with the toggle style volume knob  The Ford base part 18C815 with the rotary volume knob is the perfect change for  91 and  92 model year Explorers
