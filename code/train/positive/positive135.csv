 Just about 2 years ago  I re entered that oh so wonderful market of used car searching  Having driven a 1990 Bonneville for the last 3 years of my life  I was ready for something a little sportier  Because of insurance  Mustangs  Eclipses  and Cameros were instantly out of the question  At the time  power didn 146t matter to me as much as looks  Finally  I stumbled upon the car that would soon become mine  through the good times AND the bad  It was indeed a 1997 Ford Probe p b Appearence  i Outside  From the start  this was without a doubt the factor that sold me from the beginning  It 146s styling is amazingly intricate  and for it 146s day in age  seemed much more aerodynamic then most of the running competitors  While it didn 146t offer the ground effects or better looking rear bumper then the GT model  it did still sport the same front bumper  However  it disappointingly did not come with premium rims  or even alloy rims at that  It 146s hubcaps were very loosely attached to 14 148 black steelies  and looked like one of the worst designed I 146d ever seen  Its taillight brakelight display pattern was clear  bright  and consisted of a 3rd brake light on the upper border of the hatch window  Pop up headlights were extremely smooth looking at the time  but because of maintenance  became more of a nuisance over a good period of time  It also sported a factory spoiler  which helped to complete the car 146s small  compact design  The trunk helps to tally up yet another plus for the Probe  offering ALOT of space to store move stuff  The back seats could be put down to allow for more room  I was once able to fit a whole 10 speed bike in the back end with no problem at all  and room to spare i Inside  On the inside  it seemed extremely roomy  However  that was before I ever tried to get into the back  which almost didn 146t even exist because of its tight quarters  The upholstery was made of a cheap looking plastic  and appeared to snap into place everywhere  That didn 146t exactly thrill me  but it was going to have to work  The seats  also available in leather  were made of cloth  and provided individual bucket style seating  They were very comfortable  but after a few long trips  I found them to be a little odd in shape and hard on your neck  Mostly because there is no separate headrest to be pulled up or down  It came factory with a cheap tape deck  which I yanked out within weeks of having the car  It 146s wiring was easily noted  and color coated  However  unless you have a work manual telling what you what is what  that doesn 146t really help much  Another huge plus of the car was its overall visibility from the inside  Since it is a hatchback  it 146s comprised of many good sized windows  Because of this small factor  backing up and maneuvering on the road was made simpler and more worry free  In my opinion  the driving display was seemingly a little plain  but has everything that you could need to know while operating the car  Consisting of MPH  RPM  Oil Level  Engine Temp  Gas  and Battery  I found that it got the job done  At night  the display was seemingly a little dark  and only emits but a small green glow  which can be adjusted by the intensity knob  Its single overhead dome light doesn 146t create much light in pitch black instances  but was sufficient enough for the time being i Engine Bay  Under the hood  I found there to be alot more open space then I was expecting  Wiring however was kinda messy  with tons of stray wires running every which way  and appearing in no logical order or pattern  The engine crankcase was based almost directly in the center of the engine bay  and seemed well proportioned for a 4 cylinder  When changing the oil  I immediately discovered that the oil filter was located in a HORRIABLE place  To reach it  you must run your arm almost 3 feet deep in the engine bay  from the bottom up  and this included sliding your arm by the exhaust manifold and piping  BAD idea  Because of its extremely high temperatures  you must let the cat sit on ramps for almost 1 2 hours before you even dare stick your arm up by it  While on the topic of heat  the car 146s engine tends to run extremely hot  While the temperature gauge reads that it 146s in normal range  it is a VERY hot engine  and must be allowed to cool down for a good amount of time before working on    b Engine Stats   The standard engine in the 1997 Ford Probe is a 2 0 liter  16 valve DOHC inline 4 cylinder  While the car is manufactured under Ford 146s name  the engine itself  and most of it 146s components and counterparts are actually produced by Mazda  When I first got my Probe  it purred so quiet that you could hardly hear it running  No sudden drops in RPMs were present  nor spark or engine knock  Now  about 2 years after it was purchased  86K miles at time  I 146ve got 123K on her  and she 146s still running smoothly  Some spark knock has occurred  but is quieted by using plus  89 octane  grade gasoline  Under my experience  the engine is extremely reliable  and has yet to leave me stranded or screaming at my car At the flywheel  it produces 118 horsepower  while it is closer to about 100 horsepower at the wheel  Redlining at 6500 RPM  it 146s apparent that it 146s not a Ford engine  My specific model was a manual transmission  so I found it to be awfully peppy off the line  I also found the engine to be extremely weak and it tended to struggle on just about any hard acceleration applied below the 2000 RPM line  Once you got to about 3500 to 4000 RPM is where the power band begins to kick in  and is short lived to about 5500 RPM  Running the air conditioner takes an extremely dampening toll on horsepower  and appears to make the entire car 146s operating performance more sluggish  While this car does produce a good amount of horsepower and pull for a 4 cylinder  it is by no means a powerhouse  If you 146re looking for that  it might be wise to start elsewhere  If you 146ve got your hopes set on a Probe  I might suggest looking into it 146s more expensive and step up GT model  sporting a 164 horsepower  24 valve Quad Cam V 6 p b Performance Ride Quality   As for road stats  completely stock  my Probe was running about around a 17 8   89 MPH in the   Ford 146s recorded road test records slightly better results  but this is about what you would expect from a 6 year old car  The car 146s governor kicks in at 115 MPH  at right about 5200 RPM  Braking was decently quick  responsive and smooth  However  my car was not equipped with the optional ABS  Anti lock Brake System  so i 146m not really able to comment on that aspect  Turning and cornering was yet another strong point for the car  making it extremely maneuverable  As mentioned previously  teamed up with its excellent level of visibility  it makes for a very easy and effortless driving experience when weaving in and out of traffic  However  because the large amount of glass  fogging of the windows can start to become a problem  Especially during the wintertime  you may find yourself waiting  and waiting  and waiting even longer  just for your windows to defog When it comes to gas mileage  the Probe does put forth an extremely good effort  Stats for the car read 25 in town  and 29 on the highway  My person findings have been must better  On the average  I 146ll normally get about 29 miles in town  and almost a whopping 35 MPG on the highway  Cruising on the highway creates a very comfortable and smooth ride  ranging the smoothest from 45 to 95 MPH  However  another negative you that may very well hear from multiple Probe owners is the infamous rattling sound coming mostly from the back hatch area  While other rattles are present  the most obvious by far would be from the back  I 146ve tried multiple times to find out exactly what it is that caused this  and have yet to come up with an answer  Also  while on rattles  the windows start to come into play  Since they are rimless windows  they don 146t have a base  or track that they follow when rolled down  Because of this  even when rolled all the way down  they tend to rattle inside the door  This can be fixed  but requires taking the door apart to apply  147buffers 148 along the windows path p b Options   The 1997 Probe  like any other car  could come fully loaded  or bare to the bone  Some of the available options are as follows  Power Seats  Power Windows  Power Door Locks  Power Mirrors  Powered Sunroof  ABS  Anti lock braking system  4 Wheel Disk Brakes  Premium Sound System w equalizer  Spoiler  Premium Wheels  or Alloys  Rear Window Wiper  Ground Effects  Side Airbags  Keyless Entry  Cruise Control  Fog Lights  Leather Seats  Sports Suspension and Intermittent Wipers If fog lights were not included on your model but are desired  you will be happy to find that the harnesses for it 146s wiring was still ran through the car  making it easy to plug the factory fog lights button up to custom fog lights  Swapping out the factory Tape CD Tuner is made very simple because of its economy standard sized opening  which requires no special harnesses  Many of the other options can be added as well  rather it be by use of aftermarket parts  or even managing to find order original factory parts from Ford   Prices   At the time I bought my Probe  you could find most of the 1997 models ranging anywhere between  3000 to  7000 depending on mileage  shape  and overall condition  However  since then  there has apparently been a drop in the marketing price  and the prices have dropped through the floor  If you keep your eyes peeled  you could pick up a great steal for right around  3000 4000  However  when taking in account of the car  you had best put a good amount of money aside  because this car has been known for it 146s expensive repairs p b Repairs   Within months of owning the car  I was sadly introduced to the number one gripe of owning a Probe  Prices tend to be 2 3 times as much as they would be on say a Taurus  or Escort  Reason for this would most likely be because when the Probe came out  it had a very rare set of tools that were needed to work on it  Since it 146s a Ford Mazda hybrid  it was a total mess when it came to trying to using tools for only Fords  or only for Mazdas  Also  it 146s not exactly considered a plus that this car was discontinued  much less that the 1997 model was the  147farewell 148 year model  Since 1997 was the last year the Probe was produced  in the US  many loose ends and problems were left unsolved and fixed  It is because of this reason that even Ford dealerships aren 146t able to answer some of the problems that tend to occur p b Overview   After all is said and done  it all comes down to personal preference and choice  Would your money be best invested in this Mazda Ford discontinued hybrid  or spent it elsewhere  Well  that 146s really for you to decide  In my personal opinion  I am planning on sticking with Probe until it 146s end  However  if you are looking to a Probe  don 146t make the same mistake I did  Maybe the 4 cylinder model is perfect for you  and gas mileage means much more then performance  But if you 146re in the run for more power and somewhat upgraded or better styling  you might wanna slip into a GT  It obviously would prove to be much quicker and yield more power in about every aspect  But when it all comes down to  I can 146t completely rip on the Probe too much  because it has got me from here to there with some style  and has never left me stranded  While repairs can range from pricey to ridiculous  the car itself is almost more of a mystery then anything  The final standing question would be if you 146re willing to give this enigma a chance
