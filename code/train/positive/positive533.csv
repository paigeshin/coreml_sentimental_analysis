 In 1995 I met my husband  In 1996 we had twins  In 1998 we bought a minivan  Ack  what were we thinking  But before I go on and on about the dehumanizing effects of driving around in that giant green 7 passenger egg  let me just say how relieved we all were when we finally got RID OF IT and  in 2001  bought ourselves a 1997 Ford Explorer XL I d been enamored with the Explorer since I d worked  briefly  for Ford in the mid 90 s  During that time I had driven a couple of Explorers and really loved  em  Unfortunately  price was a major issue   plus after we had the twins everyone convinced me we needed the dreaded minivan  for more on that see my separate review  The Explorer is just a COOL vehicle  especially up here in the Pacific Northwest where everybody and their neighbor owns an SUV  Yes  the road is practically littered with Explorers   but maybe I m just not the stand out in the crowd type Now for the specifics  I personally  love  that the Explorer has less space than the minivan  From 7 seats to 5   I thought it would be a sacrifice but it hasn t been  There is plenty of room for our family and one extra passenger  We rarely used all 7 seats in the minivan  And speaking of space  that minivan seemed to just attract junk  Well  the Explorer does too  maybe it s not the car  but the kids who attract junk  but it attracts a lot LESS junk and is a breeze to clean out The seating itself is comfortable  roomy enough for our larger than normal derrieres and for both kids to spread out a little in the back seat  In the front seat  there is a nice console between the driver and passenger   including space for CD s  cassettes  2 drinks  and a little slot just perfectly sized for our cel phone  There is also a larger than average glove compartment and  makeup mirrors  on both the driver and passenger visors  In the back seat  there are seat pockets in front of each child   a big bonus  I d LOVE to see Ford  and for that matter  every other manufacturer who hasn t already done so  integrate cup holders into the back seats  It s a nice feature  and it s one thing I do miss about the minivan The rear cargo area of the Explorer is roomy and functional  It holds a LOT of stuff  we do lots of camping  and is at waist height so it s easy to load unload without too much bending and reaching  Also easy to vaccum  1 3 of the back seat also folds down flat  so that you can fit in longer things  We hauled lumber last week and still fit both of us and the two kids in the car There are a couple of features on this vehicle that really stand out  First is the rear glass can be opened separately from the rear door  That way  if you just want to stick some groceries in you don t have to open up the whole door  Another wonderful feature is that the whole car can be locked unlocked via a well placed switch inside the back door  So while I m loading the groceries  I can unlock the doors for the kids without having to fumble for my keys Our Explorer also includes a towing package  making it capable of towing up to 3 500 pounds  about the size of a small travel trailer or boat  a nice cassette stereo system  and roof rack  The vehicle is sturdy  survived a rear end collision this winter that caused  2 500 in damage to the other vehicle and left our car with not even a scratch  roomy  and safe  We also have had the opportunity to use the 4WD a couple of times and it worked flawlessly  It s shift on the fly so there is no need to get out of the car to lock the hubs or anything annoying like that  Our repair bills  knock on wood  have been negligible   we keep the oil changed and keep up on the schedule maintenance  and  I know I m jinxing myself here  she runs like a gem The only major drawbacks to the Explorer are the excessive road noise  sometimes that s nice  though  as it tends to lull the kids to sleep  and the poor gas mileage  We fill up about once a week  and that s with average daily around town driving  A freeway trip to Seattle  180 miles round trip  costs us about  10 12 in gas  Expect about 280 miles per tank full on the highway and about 200 in town  I guess that s just what we expect when you buy an SUV  though   we have to trade  something  for all that space
