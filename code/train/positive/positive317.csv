 I have a Ford Windstar LX 99  It is so comfortable  quiet and spacious  The redesign of this car was a complete success  it is larger with more available amenities and the option of a much more powerful engine 3 8L V6  The addition of a second sliding door makes the all new Ford Windstar a very good choice in your Minivan  In the van I felt very safe knowing that is got quadrouple five star safety ratings very high marks It is the most comfortable  quiet and spacious minivan I have ever been in  and I was only in the LX model  It is priced right at about  20 000 to start and boy  it is well worth it I had an early nineties sedan that was much less manuverable than this van and it is three times the size br br
