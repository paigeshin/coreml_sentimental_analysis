 We bought the 1999 Ford Ranger for our daughter  She was headed off to college and needed reliable  safe  and affordable transportation  We haven t had one misgiving since purchasing it over a year ago My husband liked the idea of a vehicle with a full body frame  I like the idea of the dual airbags  The 4 cylinder engine doesn t use up excessive amounts of gasoline  making it a vehicle she can afford to drive The cab is small  but that s okay with us  too  This ensures she won t have loads of passengers with her  We bought the basic model  which included only a cassette player  radio  but no air conditioning   Hey  we were buying her a vehicle  what more could she ask for My husband likes the idea that with a 4 cylinder  she doesn t get a great deal of pick up when accelerating  I just like the idea that it starts every time she turns the ignition  whether in the heat of summer or sub zero winter temperatures The truck bed has come in handy  especially when she moved all of her belongings away to go to college We purchased the Ranger with Ford s 0 9  financing  With a little homework we discovered that we actually saved money buying her a brand new Ranger  rather than the 1996 we had first considered
