 I recently purchased the 2000 Ford Focus  I am very impressed with the 16 valve 2 0 litre engine  The engine provides lots of power  There is plenty of room in the front and rear seats  My baby car seat fits comfortably in the rear seat  The console is attractively designed and has an original look  The LED display on the radio gives the time and station simultaneously  The manufacturer s CD and stereo system operate smoothly and provide decent sound  The car gets excellent gas mileage and performs well on the highway  It is convenient being able to access the trunk from the interior of the car  The windows and mirrors provide good 360 degree visibility  For first time car buyers  this is THE one  The price is reasonable for what you get  The car is inexpensive but has a luxury feel br br
