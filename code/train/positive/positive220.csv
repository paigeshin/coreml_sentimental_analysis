 Best decision I ever made was begging for this truck for my graduation present  When I found it it had 38 000 miles on it and was sitting used on a new car lot  It was a 95 xlt  Came with 5speed and 2 3 liter four banger  regular cab  longbed  and am fm stereo casette  60 40 split bench  and Ford Bedliner  not bad for 8 grand  All the goodies a college freshman could want  Sometimes I wish for the 3 0 or 4 0 liter 6  but I m more than satisfied with the power my engine makes  It helps that it s a 5speed so that it s easier to make the most out of it The interior is great  comfortable  and I dont ever want an aftermarket system because the 4 speaker 80 watt system that s stock makes good enough sound that I just added an rf modulated CD changer and will wait till Im making more money and have a new truck to make serious upgrades  You gotta put it on full blast to get any distortion  and the base is impressive  You d have to be blind  with no manual dexterity and fingers the size of pickles to have any problems operating anything while driving  In fact  i was able to memorize the dash layout so I can turn any switch without taking my eyes off the road in no time  The defrost works very quickly  You can see it start to kick in in a few seconds  I d like to see the cupholders placed differently  They sit at the base of the shifter  on the transmission hump  I have to reach way too low to grab sodas  I ve seen S10 s where the cupholders retract from the front of the center console  I d like to see that setup in the Ranger  I d also like a different manual door lock design  As it is you can t unlock the doors on a non power lock ranger without opening the door because when the locks are down they are recessed all the way in their holes in the door and there s no way to pul them up without opening it  Space is good for me at 5  8 quot  but it is not a truck for people above average height  I ve had passengers wish the seats had a few more degrees of recline  There s lots of storage with a center armrest doubling as a storage bin with slots for coins and a pretty big glove box I dont know why peole complain so much about the 2 3 being gutless  Get it to rev to the sweet spot between 2500 and 3500 rpm before you dump the clutch or shift in every gear and and those 4 cylenders pull pretty damn hard and I almost forget im even driving a four banger truck engine till it runs outta steam after about 3000 rpms and the engine whine becomes noticeable  Part throttle at low speeds in first and second gear gives a healthy push  Drive it right and it ll jump off the line pretty agressively  I know I ve certainly never had to beg my way off of an expressway onramp  Of course I would never want this engine with an automatic Highway passing though is a little different  If you don t need to pick up speed quickly at all  you ll get by in 5th most of the time  The engine will pull OK in 5th on flat or very slight grades  If you want to casually dart into the fast lane to make a pass and need to accelerate from maybe 70 or so to 75 or 80  youll need 4th  But to really pick up speed fast  like from 60 or 65 to 75 or 80 and get out of a tight spot or jump into the fastlane without slowing anybody down you wont get any real acceleration above 3rd gear  But then again that s with most vehicles and I ve never found myself lacking for power when I really needed it The breaking is just as almost as good as on my parents  Corolla  Stops are short  without any fishtailing and not much nose dive  I ve had to do panic stops in rain and still never felt like the truck was getting away from me  Handling is pretty good to  The Firestones grip very OK  but I think I have the suspension design to thank for the handling more than anything else  Ride is OK with big bumps or smooth roads  it s a whole lot of small bumps close together that upset it  The only time you have to be careful is fast bumpy corners or wet turns  where it reminds you it s a truck when the rear end does the jitterbug or slides a bit when unloaded  At speed the steering is accurate with little free play and nicely weighted  But in parking lots you ll have to twist it a few times to get out of tight situations  IT s also extremely useful  Though I have a base ranger with pretty low payload it s hauled everything I ve ever needed it to  I somehow packed everything I own in it for the 2 hour drive to school  We chopped up a tree that fell in our lawn in the last storm and holled the logs away in only a couple trips  I even threw 24 cynder blocks in the back while making a quick run to Home Depo with a friend  Through it all  with only the basic recommended maintenance  I ve had no engine problems whatsoever in the 1000 plus miles I ve put on the truck  I get about 18 mpg in mostly highway driving  but Im 19 and have a leadfoot so dont let that scare you Real world range has stretched to over 250 miles with 16 5 gallon gas tank  Anyone who drive like a sane person can probably expect closer to mid or high teens in the city and 20 25 on the highway There are some annoyances though  95 was a pretty bad year for elecrical systems so if you want a used ranger get one from 96 on  Interior light sometimes stays on for up to 45 minutes after I get out and occasionally stays on the whole time im driving  Wipers are posessed  sometimes they ve come on without me turning any switches  Remember to put that parking break to the very VERY last notch before you get out and maybe even leave it in gear  otherwise it ll roll  Armrest is starting to come loose from the seat  And the hard plastic steering wheel is very slippery  sliding right through the hands in tight turns  The Ford Bedliner has started to loose it s grip on the bedrail in a couple spots  The latch meckanism on the sliding rear window can be flimsy  Ive locked the keys in the truck and been able to get in with a screw driver  so you might want to put a lock on it or look for one without it if security is a concern  I really wish I had gotten one with air  I think more should be standard in the xlt package Basically I love this truck  all the important things are done right  there s just some minor annoyances that I can easily live with  Good  economical  useful  stylish transportation Since I got it I have added a 6 disk CD changer and various cosmetics such as body color matched tail light covers  blacked out headlight covers  ventvisors  bug deflector  shade blade  and soft tonneau cover  some know what all that stuff is and some don t but suffice it to say when I learned about the huge custom product market available for puckups I went nuts and I probably still haven t finished Update This is an update to a December opinion I wrote over a year ago about my new Ford Ranger  It s been 55 000 miles and the engine has performed almost flawlessly  It s only hiccup was a winter day in subzero temperatures in which I stalled by slipping the clutch too quickly and it took a few tries to get it started back up  Other than that I m never disappointed when I turn the key and have never been left stranded There are some annoyances  some small  some large  My temperature gauge dies on me at about 48 000 miles  Usually when this happens it s a sensor that must be replaced for about 18 dollars  It s extremely rare for the actual gauge to die  Lucky me  The dealer quoted me 360 dollars to replace it  That will have to wait  It does not affect how the engine runs so I will have to do without it because that s alot to a College kid The brakes needed to be replaced at about 55 000 miles  a little earlier than what I m used to but then again I do tend to drive like teenager because that s what I am  I also had to make a few panic stops  So I had the pads replaced and the shoes remachined at Pep Boys  which seemingly did good work  Their brakes seem to bite better and make for better stops than the Ford units  though they were very good I didn t particularly like the Firestones  which gave out too early in the corners and rode roughly  so I replaced them at 51 000 miles with Goodyear Laramie touring tires  which aren t well known but did a better job of smoothing the ride and sticking in the corners  The firestones weren t really done for yet but I happened to have money at the time and figured it would be wise to replace them when I could rather than wait till they were bald  when I might not have any money  Ahhh  the precarious income of a college student On the inside the interior light goes off when it s supposed to about 80 percent of the time  and the rest of the time when it gets annoying I pull the fuse  A sensor in the door probably either needs to be replaced or cleaned off  Also  the on off button on the radio no longer works properly  so the radio stays on all the time  The driver s side window squeaks when lowered  A lubricant will probably help The paint has held up very well  There is no fading or peeling  only the normal scratches and dings from everyday driving  The bad primer and flimsy finishes that plagued pre 93 Rangers is no more The best fuel range with the 16 5 gallon tank is now 287 miles  but I think there s the potential to do better and maybe surpass 300  I put fuel injector cleaner in with the last tank  I also think part of it is that I m a little scared to dip too far into that reserve past E  but I m gonna go for it and update on the mileage soon So aside from new brakes  which has alot to do with driving habbits  and new tires  which I didn t really need  this truck has not demanded any other money for the most part except for cool stuff I pput on to personalize it Mileage Update  5 20 00 I just finished off a tank that was about 60 40 highway city driving  I drove it from when the tank was topped off at 16 5 miles per gallon until past E with the fuel light on  for the best range yet of 315 miles  probably with a few more left  That s roughly 19 mpg  I know  I know  less than what most would expect from this type of truck  but keep in mind that s with my jackrabbit starts in the city and 75 85 mph cruising speeds on the highway  This tank looks even more promising  as it is at the half way mark and it s already taken me 180 miles or so  I expect low 20 s when I tabulate it  Update  Range this time around with 60  highway cruising at about 75 85mph and around town driving came to 318 miles total exactly from top off until I lost my nerve after having driven several miles past when the low fuel light came on  The bed cover stayed down almost the whole time and I definitely thinks it helps me gain one or two mph  I m going to try to be even more conservative in my driving with this tank and see if I can break 320  I m thinking it probably won t get much better than low 20 s overall no matter what I do  Maybe a K amp N filter will snag me another mpg  One thing s for sure  I don t know how those guys with the half ton and three quarter ton pickups deal with 30 40 dollar fillups once a week  Update  57 800 miles 7 1 00 So far so good  no big problems  never any hesitation on startup  The clutch feels just as strong as new  I think they put particularly good ones on the manual transmissions in this truck  The parking brake has another inch or so of give when you put it on and realease the foot brake  The same minor electrical annoyances persist  The stubborn interior light  whose fuse was pulled  and the gauges that occassionally act up  though thankfully they stull are functional  There is some steering pull to the right under hard braking despite the fact that there are only 10 000 miles on the brakes and I got an alignment about 4 000 miles ago  Fuel economy has stayed the same at about 19 mpg mpg  though I haven t gone from tip off to near empty in awhile so I m gonna try it again soo and see what happens  The check gauge light comes on quite often though I have it serviced regularly and nothing has been found wrong with the truck  Really hard bumps seem to trigger it quite often  95 was such a bad year for electricals  The big 60 000 mile service is coming up  with belt replacements  inspections  etc  I may shop independant mechanics to get a better deal on the more expensive stuff  Pep Boys is a possibility  I ll report back on how smoothly it goes soon 7 15 00 Mileage Update I just went through another good full tank of 16 5 gallons for 332 miles  or about 20 1212 mpg  with what seemed like a good 15 20 miles left  The fuel light had been on only a few minutes when I finally filled up  I think my numbers should have been at this level from the beginning but it has taken me awhile to get up the nerve to dip into that reserve past E and get as close as possible to an almost empty tank for an accurate reading without stranding myself somewhere  This tank was about a 50 50 mixture of hard accelarating jack rabbit starts and stop and go city traffic and 75 90 mph cruising on the highway with occassional downshifting to fourth  There were also ocasional traffic jams and highway slow downs  Some have criticized my truck s mileage  But I think averaging about 20 mpg is pretty good for a lead footed pickup driver  I also think there was still a few miles left and believe I could have reached 345 350 miles total on this tank  for about 21 mpg  If I drove more gently at all times  which I am sure I probably never will  25 overall should be reachable
