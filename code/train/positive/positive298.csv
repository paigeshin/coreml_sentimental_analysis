 Being a young  single person  such as myself  there is not much of a need for a minivan  but I checked it out nonetheless  Aesthetically  it has the same look and feel of other minivans  but with a significant advantage  Upon getting into the minvan  you first notice the room   no more cramped legs up front or in the rear  with plenty of room to add accessories  such as a console for beverages cd s tapes etc  Space aside  the seats also have a great deal of maneuvering power  so it is definitely possible to achieve that comfortable position you had in the last car  Another plus is the rear sliding door  as there is one on either side of the minivan  No more line ups to get inside the van Once the seat is adjusted and you turn the engine on  surprise  a nice  healthy engine with no obtrusive noises  After you hit the gas pedal and start driving  you notice the immense power this vehicle has   it is so smooth and able to achieve your desired speed rather quickly  It s almost like driving a car  When driving uphill  you never fell the need to  quot floor quot  it  just to be able to drive above 2 miles an hour When you see the light ahead about to turn red and get ready to hit the brakes  the Windstar brakes so effortlessly  coming to a complete stop exactly where you want to stop  Even for those sudden slam on the brakes moments  you will notice that this vehicle does not at all jerk you forward  It adjusts were well to abrupt and harsh driving conditions The only downside is inside the minivan  Parents may notice that the rear window latches are a little on the clumsy side  and have the potential to result in jammed little fingers While this isn t necessarily the most affordable minivan  it is a good complete package  boasting a modern appearance and a good ride  making this a very good choice for people who need the roominess of a minivan  but don t like traditional minivans br br
