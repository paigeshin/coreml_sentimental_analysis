 I used to own a 1992 Escort in college  and it was a great car  It was a 5 speed with the dual overhead cam which made for a very sporty ride  People were always surprised by the performance  and I was always very pleased with it  The interior was extremely comfy  with lots of room in the back seat  4 door  pleanty of head and leg room  and the trunk had generous space as well  I bought it used and never had to fix anything on it  well once I had to replace the battery  It was a wonderful car  and always reliable and dependable  If you re thinking about buying a used one in this era  I would strongly recommed that you get one with the cam  you won t regret it  I loved the car br br
