 The ZX2 seems to be breaking away from the overall  quot Escort quot  category  While there is still a small  quot Escort quot  on the back  there is a large ZX2 in script on the rear window  rear bumper and on the backs of the front seats  And there s a good reason for this This isn t an Escort  It s more like a slightly smaller Probe  The engine is a Contour engine so it has a bit more getup and go  It still pulls a bit too much RPM when you floor it  but it s better than a Plymouth Breeze or Dodge Stratus  Inside there is surprising room  I m 6 5 quot  tall and I actually have headroom  Shoulder room is a little less  But it s less in everything but the most  quot luxury quot  cars these days  There actually seems to be more leg room than there is in the Taurus  The car looks sporty  Which is something you can t say about any of the other Fords  save the Mustang  And the Mustang has rear wheel drive and costs a couple grand more  The car does sit a little higher off of the road than most sporty vehicles  It handles well but doesn t quit stick to the corner  Gearing is good  The automatic transmission is smooth  The model I purchased came with everything  Power windows  power doors  a 6 cd changer  power mirrors  anchored floor mats  fancy wheels  larger tires  tilt steering wheel and the price tag was still around  16K  To get the same ammenities on any other car I looked out would have taken the price over the  20K mark  The seats are nicely designed  but slightly small  If you re not over 6  and not over 200 lbs you probably won t notice this  The sound system is excellent  Other controls are easy to reach  Though the horn needs to be a little more sensitive  Outside mirrors are adequate  though they seem a bit chintzy  They do the job  But that s all  The cabin is a bit noisy during acceleration  but about what you d expect for a subcompact with a bigger than normal engine in it  Cornering in normal driving is good  but sharp cornering is not quite what it should be
