 Go Big Red is what our F150 seems to shout to everyone who looks on  This flashy red truck with a V 6 and 5 speed manual transmission seems to have enough power for me and can spin tires without even trying  We purchased her recently from   Jim s Dodge Country   located at 5402 L St  in Omaha  The salesperson was originally asking  12 600  but we were able to negotiate down to  10 800  which was the bottom of the range that  First National Bank of Omaha   quoted us for a loan  I will discuss financing possibilities later in the review  We bought this truck to go back and forth to work and for camping  note my camping reviews  We do not intend to tow anything such as a boat b  Positives   Some of the features that we enjoy are  wide seating  enough for 3 adults in the front seat  heater that heats up quickly within the first mile in 12 degree weather  after a 2 minute warm up  reliable starting in cold weather  long  wide bed for camping  relatively smooth QUIET ride  unlike my Mazda B2000  22 000 miles with 14 000 miles and 6 months left on the warranty  There are also gauges on the dash  including  temperature  oil  charging and fuel  The dome light turns on automatically along with a couple of auxiliary lights  in the same compartment  behind the driver s seat  There are four speakers in the cab  giving a luxurious sound and GREAT separation  There is a dual cup holder which pops out of the dash  just above the ashtray  This cupholder holds a 20 ounce soda perfectly  There is a dual cigarette lighter  perhaps one for lighting cigarettes and the other for power toys such as a TV  cell phone charger or auxiliary defroster  If you should not shut your door properly  a light comes on to tell you that your door is ajar  This truck features a 30 gallon gas tank  with 15 mpg city and 17 mpg highway  as stated on the original window tag Also  I have found that this vehicle has more leg room than my Mazda did  I normally would drive the Mazda with the seat all the way back  even though many mechanics would move it up  I have found that I can drive comfortably with the seat moved forward about 4 inches  There is plenty of room in back of the seat  which is split  60 40  and carpeted on the back  There is ample storage in back of the seat  in case I wish to keep store purchases out of view  The dash is deep  about an arm s length  which I guess is neither here nor there  but perhaps worth mentioning  There are also pockets on each door  which would be handy for maps  coupon books  etc  There is also a compartment near the steering wheel for one to put small items in  The glove box is wide  but not very deep  One can see the traffic up ahead as this vehicle sits higher than most other vehicles  This vehicle has dual mirrors  the passenger side one is slightly convex b  Negatives   Some of the drawbacks  the bed in this full sized 2 wheel drive pickup is TALL  It can be difficult to reach items that you put in the box  It will be difficult to scrape ice off the windshield in the middle of winter  Also  I tend to hold the steering wheel by the horizontal bar that the horn is on  while driving  This is wider in this vehicle than in the Mazda that I am used to driving  My large hands barely fit  a smaller woman probably wouldn t be able to use this gripping method  as the airbag is contained within  Speaking of airbags  there is a place to turn off the passenger airbag  It may take a key  as I see a key slot  as well as a button  I will need to investigate this  however we have no small children in our household  The vehicle itself is wider than I am normally used to driving  I am unsure about fine points of parking this larger vehicle  The key can be awkward to turn off  as there is an extra lever which needs to be turned off  but perhaps it is this way in all Fords                                                         3 10 01 OK  not even one month later  I am discovering that the heater control switch  the dial which switches the air from hot to cold is not functioning properly   Sometimes  you have to turn the knob back and forth to get the warm air to properly fill the cab  It can force you out when it is zero degrees out  or feel lukewarm when it is 30 degrees out  Guess they ll have to replace the switch  Being too hot is not a problem  being too cool is  Seems it only happens SOMETIMES  but not when it is in the shop As well  as I was stopping at a stop light this afternoon  the check engine light came on  The owner s manual said this could be because I was out of gas  had water in the tank or a couple of other variables including emissions problems  Wasn t running choppy at all  I turned the engine off and back on and it was still there  Could this be a Fix Or Repair Daily  I hope things don t go wrong this regularly when the warranty expires in a few months  When I took it in for warranty work  they noted that a bad oxygen sensor needed replacing  which they did  free of charge  As well  the hazard lights do not always work properly  and sometimes only one out of four lights blink                                                           7 29 01 I took the Ford in earlier this week because the overhead light did not come on consistently when I opened the drivers  door  They replaced the switch free of charge  one month left on the warranty Also  I noted that when I drove home during a 3 hour trip on a very humid day  there was a bit of condensation coming off the air conditioning unit placed above my sandal clad feet  The water was not excessive  but noticeable upon my nearly bare feet  nonetheless                                                             05 12 02 Things seem to have gone well with this truck and we just put on 2 000 miles on a one week trip  The truck handled well on the rainy streets  It can burn rubber easily when backing up a wet hill  however I back into my driveway  which is on a hill  If I park on the hill  rather than the base of the hill  I can occasionally hear the truck creeking backward  My husband has successfully parked half way up the hill when encouraging the sun to melt the snow in the winter time Occasionally the passenger seatbelt will make a ratcheting sound  It works  but the sound is annoying 11 02 The starter is starting to go out  It is not releasing  retracting or whatever it is supposed to do  We have 50 000 miles on it  The cost of a replacement  lifetime warranty  was  250  Our average distance driven one way to work is 10 miles  We also run errands with this truck  It is also used for pleasure and long distance trips 1 2 times a year 7 03 I was shifting gears quickly to change lanes in heavy traffic  That is when the manual gearshifter knob came off in my hand  I suppose it could have caused an accident  Mileage  60 000  Replacement gear shift knob  approximately  14 7 03 We have about 61 000 miles on the truck  I was driving along perfectly well  I stopped for a minute and attempted to restart the truck  It kept turning over  but never started  When I did coax it to start  it ran VERY rough  and I was scared to drive it  Seems the FUEL PUMP went out  Bill 360  We had a range of  290 from a private garage to over  400 at the dealer  The fuel pump is located by the fuel tank and one needs to take off the fuel tank to gain access The hood may be made from aluminum or plastic as it will not hold a magnet  Unsure of the gauge of tin used elsewhere on the body What I REALLY like  is the warning bell when you ve left your headlights on  The pockets alongside the doors are handy for maps  etc  I like the mini storage behind the seats b Criteria  Before I took delivery of this vehicle  I wanted to see what it was worth  We both looked in the classifieds and online  We called my bank   First National Bank of Omaha    and they said they would loan anywhere from  10 800 to  14 000 or so for this vehicle  I inquired as to financing and they quoted us 9 1  with my excellent credit  I also checked with my insurance company   State Farm   who quoted us 8 25 on a 60 month loan  The dealer   Jim s Dodge Country    went through  Commercial Federal  and was able to get us a 8 1  loan  when a day earlier he quoted us a loan rate somewhere in the high 8  range for persons with good credit Another criteria that I had was to have my mechanic    Keith Pauley    owner of   All Pro Muffler and Brakes    located at 4646 S  60 St  Omaha  Nebraska  do a free mechanical inspection before the deal was finalized  We have been doing business with Keith ever since he opened about 5 years ago  We went in there to have our brakes replaced on our Chevette  only to have him tell us that all they needed was a free adjustment  He has had our business ever since  Keith informed us that the parking brake did not hold on our new Ford when it was on a hill  and the brake light on the dash had a short and suggested that we have this fixed at  H P  Smith Ford   as it was still under warranty  He also advised that the tires needed replacing    All Pro   specializes in brake and muffler repair service  Other than brakes and mufflers  Keith s customers have demanded that he go into virtually all kinds of mechanical repairs  He is a straightforward person and will tell you the way it is  being nice in the process We asked the salesperson at   Jim s Dodge Country   to see if he could get us a good deal on tires  He called a nearby company    T O  Hass Tires   located at 5120 L St  who made us a good deal  We also went to  H P  Smith Ford   located at 5051 L St  who very agreeably set up service for the items still under warranty  He even informed us that the warranty was 5 months longer than the salesman originally told us  Also  the salesman mentioned that there were no recalls on this particular vehicle Speaking of seats  I work the night shift  I make it a habit to take my lunch sleeping in the cab of this vehicle  It is very easy to throw your legs over the bench seat  rest your head on the driver window  and take a nap  Taking a nap in our Mazda pickup cab is a chore compared to this All in all  we are very pleased with our purchase  If things change  you will be the second folks to know   FYI  We used to have a Ford F250  1981  which was a Fix Or Repair Daily However  the truck was a 3 owner  high mileage truck with a strong 460 V 8   my husband adds For some odd reason  my husband wanted to buy another Ford  Hopefully we will have better luck with this one
