 My mom bought this SUV a few years ago  and its been nothing but trouble  The motor and the transmission was already replaced in this SUV  and it s only 8 years old   1992  We bought it because of its sporty looks and durability and off roading ability  But we had no idea what was in store Since I have gotten my learners license  I was actually allowed to drive this car  The Explorer I noticed at first is very very preppy and has lots of horsepower  Just stepping on the accelerator and it leaps forward  ready for action  When I m waiting at the stop line at an intersection  sometimes people look at me as a learner who just puts along and avoids everything  When the light turns green I leap forward and I beat everybody and zoom ahead  You should see the looks on their faces when I am way ahead of them  The 4X4 in the winter works really well  handles any kind of weather conditions  The only thing is that its really noisy when you turn it on and you have to go outside to switch the switch to go offroad  When you do  its a bumpy ride and juggly  The steering is crisp and responsive  but the power steering groans when you turn it too much  The brakes respond very quickly and straight The bad thing is that it has gone through a lot of repairs  Either that or this is a lemon we got  The door handle has broken off  radiator replaced  timing belt broken  electrical problems  the lights go on and off for no reason  Of course there was the daily tuneups and fixes etc  The windshield wiper switch is broken and the light switch is in a weird spot  Sometimes the oil leeks into the motor  and burning of course creating smoke  It doesn t really go well up long  high hills without overheating  The seats are alright  but in the back its kinda uncomfortable after a while  not very cushy   When it gets to high speeds it jiggles around and starts squeaking and you can t hear the radio that well at highway conditions  At city speeds its fine  The radio that they give you is fine  but not great  Also the gas mileage is not that great  especially when you have the 4X4 on  it just gobbles the gas up like crazy   not very good these days with the gas prices rising So this is a pretty reliable SUV  and if you want lots of pep  this is the car for you  The only thing is that the repair bills is high and your wallet will get lighter  Maybe ours was a lemon  but its good for a family br br
