 We have an 89  Ford econoline van for personal use  and have had 3 Club wagons over the past few years for transporting our 8 foster children  Our 89  is like a tank  it is kind of ugly too  but that thing just keeps on ticking  We had to replace the transmission recently at a cost of approx   1000  We went ahead and replaced it since it is the only problem we have ever had from the van  It does not have the best gas milege  which is hard with these high gas prices  But it does have 2 tanks which helps sot hat you do not have to constantly stop for gas Also the shades in the windows have rotted  I wish they had been made with a better quality fabric We have had a 90  92  94  clubwagons that took a beating and kept on going  We averaged 50 000 miles a year  The only major problem we had was that the brakes did not last as long as they really should have  The interior stayed nice even with 11 kids on board most of the time br br
