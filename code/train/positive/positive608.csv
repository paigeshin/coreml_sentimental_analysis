 The first car I ever had was a 1981 Ford Escort  and the first new car I bought was a 1998 Escort ZX2  The only similarity between the two vehicles is the name  and that s not a bad thing Unlike the underpowered Escort of old with the paper thin doors  the ZX2 feels like a car that isn t at the bottom of the new car price level  But the fact is the ZX2 is an affordable new car  I thinks it s the best car on the market for less than  15 000  In fact  it can be well below 15 grand if you can live without the spoiler and automatic transmission  It s more fun to drive with the manual transmission anyway After putting 43 000 miles on my ZX2 without a trip to the mechanic  I have to say I m thrilled with the car  It seems to have all the power you really need  but it isn t a gas hog with just a four cylinder engine  One of my favorite parts of the design is the wide wheelbase  which allows for excellent handling  It doesn t corner like a BMW  but you don t pay what you would for a true sports car And if you like loud music while you drive  the optional premium sound package with the CD changer is worth the money In short  this is a fine car for anyone who wants a fun  reliable car that won t make their insurance go way up  One warning This is not the perfect car for those with young children  Getting a car seat from the back would not be an easy chore br br
