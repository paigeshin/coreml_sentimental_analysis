 I bought this Taurus used in 1996 for   5 800 00 with 63 000 miles on it and have had it ever since  I have kept up with the maintenance  and the car has served me well  It only left me stranded once during all these years  and even then the mechanics could not figure out what had happened  It would not do that ever again The car rides comfortably and the radio works well  I am still on the original 1990 factory radio  The display has long burned out  but i have memorized all my presets Repairs have included  replaced alternator and battery in the fall of 1999  replaced front shocks in spring of 1999  replaced water pump in the fall of 2000  replaced a c system in June 2001 Considering the age of the car  it is not too bad  I have 135 000 miles on it and will drive it till it disintegrates into small particles
