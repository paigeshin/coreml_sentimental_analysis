  Cruising In My Big T b  I have had my  91 Thunderbird for 4 years now  bought it way back in my freshman year and it has served me well throughout college  I am a horrible Northern driver and brutal on my vehicles  but this piece of Ford craftsmanship refuses to bail out on me  It s a rough and tumble vehicle that remains an incredible deal for the price  especially when bought used from a reputable dealer b The Advantages  1 Seat Space These are big seats people  with the kind of legroom that only those pretentious you know whats in first class usually get their hands on  And that spaciousness isn t just about spoiling the people up front either  it extends to the back seat as well  which means that everyone feels just a little bit more comfortable and relaxed when you get to wherever you re going And not only are the seats big  but the generous amount of padding in each makes for an especially comfortable ride 2 Appearance I ve gt to admit it to you  I just love the look of the Thunderbird  though it is an acquired taste to be sure  I can best describe the style as  quot Italian quot  sleek in a chunky way and available in colors  like burgundy  that make it look like a cross between a hit mobile and a hearse 3 Smooth Ride Riding in my Thunderbird has always seemed quite smooth to me  especially when you consider how low to the ground it is  Why so low  That kind of positioning allows the Thunderbird to provide the rider with great control  as your  quot feel quot  for the road is significantly enhanced In the same arena as the ride is the ease of use of the console  which for me equals smoothness and ease  The Thunderbird s radio and air console is incredibly well designed with everything within reach and intuitively organized  Seem trivial to you  Try changing the station at 75 miles an hour and see how important knob placement is 4 Trunk This is a important feature for me  as I seem to move every 3 6 months  The trunk on the Thunderbird is big enough for all of your luggage  not to mention the corpse of Vinnie The Chin from a rival family b My Defense  I have read another review of this vehicle that criticizes the brake quality  and I have to vehemently disagree with it  I ride my brakes hard  and I have never had a lockup or other incident  The brakes do tend to squeek a bit  but the noise is no indication of a performance issue b The Final Verdict  The bottom line is that the Thunderbird is a comfortable and well designed car at a reasonable price  As long as you like burgundy vehicles and live in an area that s at least 30  Italian  the Thunderbird is a great option br br
