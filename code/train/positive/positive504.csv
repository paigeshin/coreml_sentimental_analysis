 When I first heard my husband say Ford Taurus  I said quot No way  that s a granny car quot  And at 27 I didn t want a granny car  Well  I decided to look at and drive the 95 model and fell in love  It has all the nice features of a more expensive car power windows and door locks  tilt  cruise  keyless entry  etc  but it was actually affordable I have been driving this car for 1 1 1 years now and plan on driving the wheels off  And this from a person that had traded vehicles every year for the past 4 years I had a truck  sports car and a mini van  but will stick with the Ford Taurus from now on  will probably buy a new one when this one goes out  The only problem I have is the doors automatically lock if the car is running  but with the keyless entry  that is not really a big deal i would recommend to any family looking for a good car for their money br br
