 The 95 FORD Contour is really a great car for anybody  It runs great every time I start it up  I ve had it for 6 years now and absolutely no major problems  Just a few minor fixer uppers  The reliability is amazing  The quality of the interior is nice  nothing fancy  but definitely nice and comfortable  The air conditioner vents are nicely designed and well placed  The over all look of the inside is well done  The v6 engine is nice and powerful  perfect for anyone The 95 Contour is also very spacious  Especially in the front  The back seats aren t too cramped though  and they could fit any average sized person comfortably  I am really impressed with the space this car has I can t say enough about the over all quality and reliability of this car  Very nice for long or short trips  Highly recommended
