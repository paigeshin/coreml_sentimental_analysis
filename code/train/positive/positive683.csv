 I bought the Focus because of the overall value and quality of the car  My Focus came with all the options except a cd changer and it was under 15 grand  I love how the car handles and rides  I had a Mercury Mystique before the Focus and this car is so much more refined in the ride and comfort of all passengers  The only complaint I have about the suspension of the vehicle is that when riding over dips over the road sometimes there is a thump sound from the front of the car  The powertrain of my Focus came with the 130 horsepower 2 0 liter Zetec four cylinder mated to a 5 speed manual tranny that motivates the car pretty good  The tranny is matched perfect with the engine  providing pretty good acceleration in all gears  The seats are very supportive and comfortable on long trips  The design of the dash is ergonomic and it looks good  everything is where it should be  within easy reach from the driver s seat and the tilting telescoping steering wheel is a nice addition  There are three cupholders in the Focus  one in the back of the center console for a rear passenger  and two up front  The front cupholders are allright for soda cans and bottles  but don t try to put a big gulp in them because the dash hangs down too low  Trunk space is a very respectable 13 cubic feet and the fuel tank holds 13 2 gallons which will give you an estimated range of 330 miles in town based on 25 miles per gallon and 448 miles on the highway based on 34 miles a gallon  The sound system in the Focus is surprisingly good considering that all four of the speakers are in the doors  you can turn the volume up and the speakers will not distort  Overall  I love my Focus  and for the money you get a whole lot of car br br
