 Every family needs a truck at one point or another  My family has personally retired four trucks in the last 8 years  When shopping  we look for something that gets good gas mileage  requires low maintenance  and is comfortable to ride in  We ve had a Chevy  a Dodge  and a GMC  but once we got our first Ford  we found out what driving a truck is all about  The Ranger has a good size bed for hauling  a strong enough motor to tow just about anything  and all the amenities you get from a car  Ranger s with the extra cab and jump seats are especially nice for families with young children  Part and repair on the Ranger are very reasonable  not that I have had to repair anything  My truck gets about 22 miles to the gallon  which is good for a truck  Being a woman  I am always looking for a reliable car  I don t want to deal with repair work  I want to feel protected even in a small truck  I want to know that I won t break down in the middle of no where at night  In my Ranger  I have all the securities I am looking for  It has duel air bags  with a shut off switch for the passengers side  Adjustable shoulder belts allow anyone to wear the seat belt comfortably  Anti Lock Breaks allow me to drive the California Freeways without fear  Reasonable price and easy on the insurance  the Ford Ranger is the best small truck on the market br br
