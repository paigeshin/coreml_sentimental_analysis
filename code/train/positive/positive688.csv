 The Ford Focus is a great little record setting car  It is the first car to ever win North American Car of the Year  and European Car of the Year awards  And it definitely deserves it  This car is the same overall length as the Escort  but the wheelbase is about 5 inches longer  This means that the cabin is extremely roomy  The roof is high  enabling the driver to sit up higher  and provide more room  in every direction  Designed in Europe  it is extremely easy for older people to use  The Ford staff designed a suit which made the wearer feel more elderly  This made it possible for them to design a car that is more friendly to older drivers  This car also looks awesome  The  quot new edge quot  design that Ford uses gives this car a clean  sporty  distinctive look  It is hard to figure out which of the models  sedan  wagon  ZX3 coupe  looks the best  but the wagon is definitely very functional  Ford has scratched plans for an MPV vehicle  and will probably not build a coupe model  It is possible that the new Volvo S40 and V50 will be built on this platform  but this isn t definite  Overall  this car is a steal  It is cheap and gives you a lot of  quot car quot  It was given the revered  quot Automobile of the Year quot  status  and is great for any kind of person with a low budget for a car  If the looks don t hook you  the drive will  I recommend the ZX3 model because it is the cheapest and has the most standard features  2 0 zetec engine at about 130 bhp  CD player standard  etc  In the month of July  the Focus was the 10th best selling vehicle in America with about 30 000 units  The only real down side to the Focus is the interior  In my opinion  it could have been made much nicer  The buttons feel a little fragile  The seats are great  but the headrests are terrible  My  96 Nissan Sentra has a very nice interior  it is simple and durable  Overall  the Focus is a great car  and it leads the class in almost every way br br
