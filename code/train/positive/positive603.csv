 I m currently leasing a brand new 2000 Ford Ranger Truck  It s a 4 wheel drive with a V 6 engine  It rides pretty smooth and it came with all the accessories and I do mean ALL  I love the CD player  This is my first truck and it wasn t my first choice  Money was a factor since I still owed on my other car and trucks depreciate less I ve been told  All in all I like it  Besides the accessories  I like the fact that I sit high up and the 4 wheel drive will come in handy in the snow  I live in Minnesota  It also has a step on the side to get up into the the pick up area if you are carrying something in back  It would be great for moving big furniture  I find it hard to get back into the extended cab area  however  to store things  I miss my trunk  Also  it doesn t get good gas mileage and I drive a lot for my job  THere s also this annoying sound when you don t buckle your seat belt right away  It will ding about ten times very fast and if you still don t put your seat belt on it will continue to do this every minute  O K  Already  Anyway  so far  it has turned out to be a nice little truck for me br br
