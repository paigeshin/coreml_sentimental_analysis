 When the Focus was announced as the replacement to the popular Ford Escort  I must admit  I had my doubts  After years of 1980 s domination where nearly every drive in the country had a Sierra  Escort or Fiesta on it  Ford were struggling to keep up with the cheaper and more reliable Japanese models that flooded the market in the 1990 s  Ford were losing shed loads of money to its competition in Europe and still is  So was the Focus really the market saviour  Well  no  I dont think it was or is  In the mid 90 s when it first hit the streets I just thought   Oh my god  what is that ugly thing  Yet it seems to have spawned a whole host of ugly mobiles from various manufacturers  The straight orderly lines of 80 s cars had been replaced by uneven and ugly curves that appeared to have come straight off the concept board  Ok it had been beaten to the medium size car market by the even uglier and more wierd Fiat Brava and Bravo but this was the first major player to make a statement  Looks    Looking at the car from the outside makes you think   hang on  from the front it looks just like a Fiesta Ka  Well it does with its sloping pointy angry looking headlights and oval grille  Moving back along the doors  they seem to take up the majority of the side panels  Its the rear of the car that really confuses me  It is possibly the ugliest monstrosity to come out of the design house at Dunton  Essex  No Boot  well it is a hatchback  But it is all part of the rear of the car  I liken it to the equally confused looking Nissan Almera for stragest boot in the world prize  It looks like it has had a rear end shunt and the lights have ended up somewhere at the top of the car  I dont like this  Interior    Typical Ford plastic adorns the interior  All Fords smell the same  Plastic  The dash is very arty with its White Dials that are so common today  The stereo takes up most of the centre console and looks a nightmare if you want to install an after market unit  Thankfully the people who supplied the stereo  Visteon  have done themselves proud by making a half decent effort at the sound system  This is something Ford s have lacked for sometime  Handling    Suprisingly good  Traction control really helps out the wheelspin and ABS stops you when you ask  No skidding or slipping here  The Semi Stiff shocks give you a nice level ride but can be a bit severe on your bad back if you hit the bumps  Still  a nice drive on the motorway  Acceleration    After driving both the 1 6 and 1 8 models  you can notice a pulling difference between these cars  The 1 8 allows you to pull into the traffic when you want rather than wait for a gap big enough  Its no neck breaker but ample for most people  thats because it has its power supplied by one of the best engines in the market  The Zetec  Safety    It held up well in crash test and does come with both Driver and Passenger air bags  Overall    Id give this 7 out of 10  Handles good  drives nice but a bit ugly  Im afraid I dont think it was the saviour Ford wanted  Information    Visit the website to check it out further  www ford co uk Fer are some stats for you  1 8 Zetec 0 60mph time   8 8 seconds Power output   125 hp   6000 rpm Fuel Consumption  41mpg on Motorway  28 on Urban
