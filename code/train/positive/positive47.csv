 I bought a 1996 Mustang GT convertible in late 96 with 4 000 miles on it  It looked great and seemed a great way to take advantage of the Atlanta weather Three years later  how do I feel  Well  it s been a lot of fun and I m converted to convertibles  The Mustang itself has limitations  understandably given the price  The only design criterion is power as there are niggly issues elsewhere  such as if you use the cup holder  it is difficult to use the handbrake  And you need a handbrake because if you get this car you should be buying a manual transmission  Why would anyone buy an automatic sports car As for other design quality issues  I had problems with the driver s seatbelt fraying  The lower guide was rough and gradually wore through the belt  Also  the handbrake was misaligned within the center console  causing the rubber edging to the slot in the console to tear  The a c also failed and took 3 attempts for the dealer to fix  A piece of the roof came loose and had to be replaced The roof is pretty quick to put up or down  about 15 seconds  but requires a bit of manual effort to lock into place or unlock  especially compared with the Toyota Solara Convertible I now own Road noise is not bad for a convertible  albeit not as quiet as more expensive models I ve been in  The car is OK for reasonably long journeys  as long as you don t have to sit in the back There is tremendous acceleration if you get the revs right  If you don t  you get zero benefit from at least half the 4 6L engine as Ford Escorts can give you a run for your money  And if it s wet  don t even think about using the accelerator  If you do anything more than contemplate putting your foot down  the rear end will be all over the place  even if going in a straight line  or trying to The handling is good when dry  and the ride us hard  as you would expect from a sporty car  If you live in a neighborhood with speed bumps  make sure you test drive going over them before buying the car I ve owned other Fords and  like them  the gear shift and clutch operation is smooth  with a clear response to tell you you are in gear Still  on a nice day  it s great to put the top down and hear the noise of the V8  The top goes up and down pretty easily  It takes 15 seconds  The car looks even better with the rear cover  but that is so difficult to put on that I ve only used it twice There is a surprising amount of room in the trunk  The rear seats are very cramped for anyone bigger than a small child  I have a 10 year old that complains about lack of room  so I ll be trading it in soon Fuel economy  No idea  I m English and the gas in Georgia seems virtually free to me  compared with  5 gallon in the UK  so I never measured it  I believe that the official figures are low 20s If you want fun in a convertible  this is a fairly cheap way of achieving it  Don t expect practicality or high design though  If you want that  pay 50  more and get a BMW
