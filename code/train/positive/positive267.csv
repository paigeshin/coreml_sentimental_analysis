 I owned a 91 Escort LX Wagon  passed down from parent  while first having gotten my license  This car had a 136 000 miles on it when i received it  and sold it to a friend with 139 000 miles  It keeps on asking for more punishment  because we were both teenage first time drivers  While I will admit that the interior materials are cheap  the stereo sucks  and there were no power windows or locks  I think that it was bought new for about 11 000 dollars  so what s to be expected  The engine was fairly punchy for being only 88hp  The car is light enough for it  The steering is a little sloppy  but not bad  I felt very secure in this car  and always trusted the reliability  It had rust under the back wheel wells  but I fixed it myself  The paint had begun to faid as well  it hadn t really been cared for before I got it  Either way I think that it is a safe bet  and a good  easy car for first time drivers to learn on  I drive a 95 Dodge Avenger now  and probably would hate to go back to the less refined Escort    read my gushing review of my Avenger  love that car   but I probably would get one real cheap if the Avenger was in an accident  But that Escort is an amazing car br br
