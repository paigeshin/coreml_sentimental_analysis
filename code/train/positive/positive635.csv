 Brown Wood Grain Siding  on a car  I know you remember those long brown station wagons  I learned how to drive in one of those station wagons  I referred to my parents car as the Tank  I have had my Taurus Wagon for two years now  The wagon seats 8 people  we have the third backwards seat I never thought I would see myself saying  quot Yes  I want a wagon quot  but I did  We were trading in our Ford Windstar mini van which I liked but really did not want another mini van when I began my search for the perfect wagon  We checked out the Camry but the drivers seat felt small and there was virtually no leg room for the middle seats  We still needed space  yet I didn t feel I needed to move around in it like you would in a van  Having three kids we felt we needed that third seat  The wagaon drives smoothly and I have not had any trouble at all with it  We take it in periodically for maintenance upkeep I absolutely love my car however  my husband feels a little cramped compared to the open feeling you have in a van  Otherwise he loves the smooth and quiet ride you get  Are kids have had one complaint  however  no cup holders  Once you get them use to a van with a cup holder in every corner it is hard to go back
