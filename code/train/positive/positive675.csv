 At the age of 40  I found myself in the market for a commuter car when we decided to give our old one to a relative  As it had been some time until I had looked at an  entry level  car  it was with some trepidation that I approached a dealer lot to look at the Ford Focus  The last  entry  Ford I had owned was an  82 Mercury Bobcat straight out of college  and quality was not a word you would associate with that car Even though Ford markets this car to a much younger audience  I found that it had a number of features that appealed to me  the styling  a bit annoying at first  grew on me  My wife and niece think the car is  cute  for just over  14 000 paid for my hatchback model ZX3  the car is well equipped with 2 0L  quot Zetec quot  engine  130 hp  power windows doors  A C  automatic transmission  more on that later  cruise control  front and rear mats  remote entry system and alarm  tilt telescoping steering wheel  and a surprisingly adequate CD radio combination  I like to listen to LOUD classical music   with plenty of low brass  The radio even can adjust its sound level automatically to deal with ambient noise  About the only option I would have like to have added was the side impact air bags  which are available   a rarity in a car of this class  I m 6 6 quot  and have a pretty wide body  but the seats are quite supportive and the head room excellent  The telescoping steering wheel was a big plus  since I did have to tilt the driver side seat back  Then again  I ve had to do that in much larger cars  handling is fairly crisp  especially for an American small car  but overall ride quality is quite decent  as is road noise  Fit and finish is excellent  comparable to small Japanese cars Ford has hit the nail on the head with this award winning  world car  or at least come closer than they have before to producing a small car that can take on the Hondas and Toyota small models  The only inconveniences are small ones  For a 130 hp  130 ft lb torque engine  the automatic transmission ratios do not seem terribly well implemented  I had test driven a coupe model with the standard 5 speed which seemed much more responsive  I find a lot of downshifting required to accelerate promptly  on the highway  a convenient  quot overdrive off quot  button on the shifter makes this somewhat easier  ZX3 s don t seem to come with center consoles  which leaves your right arm sort of hanging  Front passenger seats  although equipped with a handle to tilt out of the rear passengers  way  do not automatically slide out of the way as do many other small cars  seats  CD player cannot fast forward through tracks  a minor but odd omission All in all  if you re looking for a small  fun  inexpensive  well built  and cute car  you d do worse than to test drive the Ford Focus  Also available  but not reviewed  are several models of sedan with differing trim levels  SE  LX  ZTS  a station wagon SE  and a couple of  quot custom quot  models including the Sony and  I think  one featuring a Trek bicycle and rack  with a unique color called  quot Dirt quot
