 I recently spent a week with a 1999 Contour SE on a 3000 mile vacation  When I first picked up the car  I thought that it would be a total drag  I was pleasantly surprised  though  It is a very roomy car with all the features of a more expensive car  The ride quality is excellent and managed 400 miles per tank with a lot of highway driving at speeds of 80mph  Mountainous driving requires manually shifting the automatic to get the most out of the 2 0 4 cyl engine  Braking is sure with no fade  even after driving down a 8  grade for two miles The trunk is large and roomy enough to carry luggage for four  Though billed as a 5 seater  four can sit comfortably  I have also driven V 6 Contours in the past  however the 4 cylinder wil be more than adequate for most peoples needs br br
