 The 1997 Ford Escort is highly reliable  but somewhat less impressive to be seen in than its distant cousin  the Mustang The compact has a very small turning radius  which  in city driving  is crucial  Another benefit for city drivers is the way the Escort holds its alignment  After 1 1 2 years of driving the pothole laced Monroe Ave  in Rochester  NY  and discovering many of the previously mentioned potholes  I have yet to need an alignment  The Escort s sturdy frame is a surprise  but this 4 banger s pep keeps pace with that surprise  Its speed  however  does not keep pace with radar or NY State Troopers  police band radios  Caution is needed for the heavy footed  unless you opt for the cruise control feature The trunk  likewise  is surprisingly roomy  with enough room to pack for a weekend getaway with a clotheshorse spouse and an infant s accessories  The trunk is also accessible through the fold down rear seat  which gives much needed added room when bringing 2X4 s home from the hardware store On the down side  the driver s seat is just enough off center to help your chiropractor keep up the payments on his timeshare  Additionally  the headlights tend to go out a little too often The Escort  though  is sweet on gas  scoring nearly 30 MPG in stop and go driving  And  with its front wheel drive  it s an economical option to SUV s for winter driving br br
