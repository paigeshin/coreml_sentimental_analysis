 Now first off my title might be a bit misleading  Owning an Escort doesn t make you spoiled by any means  Its not like my parents went out and bought me luxury car or anything  As a matter of fact my parents didn t go out and buy me anything  I bought it myself  and I also make my own insurance payments  I am not looking for wide spread acclaim by stating that just that I am not a materialistic suburban brat   Now to the car b I love my car   The ZX2  I own the four door model which is quite different than the ZX2 pictured by opinions  Mine is actually the exact car they show in the 1998 escort picture only mines a  99  The ZX2 is a two door model that has more of a pinched tail end  and a bit more of a bullet shape overall  It s the  sporty Escort  My best friend owns a ZX2 and she couldn t be more pleased with it  Although its not the car of her dreams it is still her baby  and she couldn t be happier   The Sedan  Most people don t associate a  real  car with the Escort name  I have heard time and again  Wow Escorts have changed this is like i a car i  Now as intellectual as this comment might sound it is all to true Up until recent years Escorts have been cheep looking hatchbacks  The Escort of today has a much larger body and a spacey interior  The sad news is that you can say goodbye to the sedan  After 1999 they are being replaced by the Focus which is an equally cute car if you ask me  But the Escort legacy isn t going to dye so soon  Ford is planning on keeping the ZX2 around for a while b My ties to the Escort  This is my third Escort  Yes my third  When I first got my license I drove around in the car my step grandmother had driven since she bought it brand new in 1982  Ha  Yes  I drove an 1982 manual Escort with no air conditioning  or any other perks for that matter including a radio  Not to mention the 250 000 miles it had racked up  But that was just fine  I loved it because it was a car  it was  my  car  However  it started to encounter some mechanical problems  finally  and we  The  rents and my self  thought best if I got a bit newer car because they didn t want me to be a 16 year old female stranded on the road somewhere  So I went with them to get a newer car  We got a 1994 Escort  This one had air  a CD player  power mirrors  and power seatbelts so I did manage to get some more stuff  That was a plus but not necessity  I grew to love that car  I really did  The only problem it has was one of the speakers had been blown out by the previous owner  But the problem was solved when I asked my mom buy me speakers for Christmas  Then the next problem came my CD player died  I was able to pick up a Pioneer flip face CD player  nice stuff  at Best Buy on Sale  It cost me 250  but it was nice  and it has and will last me for quite some time  For a surprise my mom paid for that for my birthday though  She didn t have to and I told her that  But she did and I love it  And those were the only two problems I ever had with the car  Just the audio system  Other than that I loved it and it loved me  However  a couple of months back I learned the inevitable lesson that you can t drive through other cars  And I lost my car to the  totaled  gods  Because I bought the car so cheep  I worked my finagling powers  I ended up making a bit of cash off the wreck  Because when the car is totaled the insurance company gives you market value of the car  So after a month of no car I went on a search for another car  With the money I had made off the accident I was able to spring for a nicer car  Although I was looking at 1997 s originally  I realized that I could spend about the same for a 1999  At the time I thought I had a job that was an hour or more away so I sprung for the  99  Again I love my car  I have an automatic  remote keyless entry  power mirrors and all that fun stuff  I honestly love my car  and better yet  I was able to get the old speakers and CD player installed into the new car  So everything is great  Mechanically the car is wonderful b My friends do it so should I  All of my friends sadly own Escorts  It is a very practical car for a teenager to drive  They are cheep  have great gas mileage  cheep to insure I mean come on how perfect is that M  drives a 98 ZX2  so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes  L  owns a 97 four door  so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes  J  owns a 93 two door so far only problem was when car was side swiped and insurance paid for the fixing  out side of that no costs outside of gas and oil changes  Me and L  own  99 four door sedans  surprise  surprise  so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil chnges  B  owns a  95 Neon poor  poor B  has had to put her car in the shop for the  check engine light  poor  poor girl she should have bought an Escort b The car I haven t told you about the car  What is there to say  I have no complaints  It says something that I have gone out and bought two of the same car  It says something that the 1982 Escort with 250 000 miles was still going  Fords have a bad rep  with some people  Maybe they have been burned before  but I am happy as a pig in mud  I could sit here and tell you that the car has decent pick up  I can tell you that I have had nothing but success  I could even tell you about how comfortable the seats are but I think the fact that so many are on the road lets the car speak for itself   Have you driven a Ford lately b br br
