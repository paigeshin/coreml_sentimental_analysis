  Why Ford Focus b Of the choices available to us through our leasing program  the Ford Focus was simply the cheapest model with the required safety features  twin airbags  anti lock braking system  We have been driving a leased 2003 Ford Focus auto sedan for about 6 months now in Australia b Driving Experience  We have certainly enjoyed the improvement in our driving experience as compared with our previous 7 year old small car  Daewoo Cielo  Much quieter  smoother  more powerful  We found ourselves more relaxed after longer drives  From that perspective we are very happy with this car b Features and Options  Some of the features are annoying  particularly that the indicator controls are on the  wrong  side of the steering wheel  Also  the indicator noise is incredibly loud   its unbelievable that the designers included such an annoying noise in their design  The stereo controls on the steering wheel are so close to the actual stereo controls its of no benefit to have a second set  In fact the track radio station control on the steering wheel is not intuitive and I have to work it out every time I use it  I ve stopped using it now  A common problem with the Ford Focus is that the fuel gauge fails during the first two months   this happened on our car and on several others that we know of  A further issue is that the cigarette lighter does not seem compatible with our phone charger   the same charger works in a number of other cars that we have used  Finally  the air intake defaults to  open  every time that the car starts  so closing it in traffic becomes a regular chore for us  So much for the negatives The features that we like are this car s comfort  handling and performance  Its got high headroom which is a big plus  The door lock and boot lock remote is something we love  Plenty of space in the boot The options that we got were  roof rack  we removed this immediately   the noise on the highway was shocking  scuff plates  yes we like them  passenger seat bag  too big  gets in the way  boot liner  excellent for cleaning up spills  and boot carrier net  saves the shopping from rolling around
