 I just purchased a Ford Explorer  four wheel drive two door SUV  and I love it  This truck is outstanding  Room  The Explorer is very roomy  It has room for several adults  and lots of gear  The back seat folds down for extra storage space  I recently transported two large mountain bikes in this vehicle  and they fit with no problem  in fact there was quite a bit of room to spare Power and Speed  Oh yeah  This thing is  quot zippy quot  It feels like it could fly  The engine certainly provides more than enough power for a vehicle of this size  And with the 4wd engaged it can go through just about anything  I can t wait for winter to get her  so I can run it through some serious ice  snow  and mud Handling  This truck corners very nicely  really grips the road  However I do have one complaint  the steering seems a bit  quot loose quot  a takes too little pressure on the wheel to turn  and this causes it to seem unstable  It really takes some getting used to Brakes  Good  Solid antilock brakes  No complaints there Ammenities  Air conditioner  power locks  power windows  AM FM cassette stereo  all the standard bells and whistles  I just wish it had a CD player Aesthetics  Mine is red  Very red  The lines are smooth  and rounded  It has a very pleasing look to it  The gray interior is a nice counterpoint to the bright red exterior  it provides a calming effect  Overall this thing looks great Safety  Seat belts  natch  air bags  two  Anti lock brakes  That s about all you can ask for In conclusion  a great vehicle  all around wonderful with two points of worry  steering takes some getting used to  and doesn t have a CD player br br
