 All right  now that I m married and we have a great dane  I have grown out of my regular cab Chevy  It has served it s purpose well and done everything I ve asked of it  but there is just not enough room anymore Now being from Texas  I m sure I m living up to every stereotype when I say   quot I love the Ford F 350 Crew Cab quot This truck is a giant sure  but when it comes to comfort  power and styling you just can t beat this truck The one I drove had the Lariat package which included all the bells and whistles  If your familiar with Ford trucks  you know that this is the top of the line  and they like to charge you for it The leather seats do more than just hug you  they embrace you  After a hard day at work they just call out to you  And this is a truck that actually makes you look forward to the commute  It s that comfy This truck also makes you feel really safe  The one I drove was a 4X4 so I sat higher than just about everything else out there  I was almost eye to eye with the big trucks  That was kinda cool As for power  how does 235 HP   2 700 RPM and 500 lb ft of torque   1 600 RPM sound  Yes  I had the Powerstroke diesel  Although this is not a choice for many people  this truck will out pull just about anything  And it looks good doing it Another thing I like about the diesel is that it s like riding on a Harley  The sound of it demands attention  Of course this Harley has a cab for 5  I got the bucket seats  air conditioning  CD changer  trip computer  and reliability One thing I haven t mentioned yet was rear seat comfort  Well  you won t be disappointed here either  I believe it s rated at 41 quot  of head room and almost 43 quot  of leg room  This  shockingly  is more leg room than even the front passengers have  At 6 0 quot  I was more than pleased Things I don t like  ground clearance  The truck I drove had the Off Road package  This includes two skid plates  one for the transfer case and one for the fuel tank  and a decal  With the size of this truck you think it would be perfect for doing a little trail riding  However  the  quot pumpkin quot  has only 8 quot  of clearance  I know  I know  that s what lift kits and 35 quot  tires are for  Little news for you  even 35 quot  tires look a little small on this truck Only other thing I don t like   parallel parking  Never had to do it  just wouldn t happen So if you re in the market for a work truck  a crew cab  or even a half price Hummer  this truck is for you br br
