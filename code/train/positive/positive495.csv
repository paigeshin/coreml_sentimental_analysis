 I have just purchased a RHD Ford Maverick known as the Ford Escape in the U S I need a vehicle that was capable enough to tow my caravan   trailor plus it had to be car like to drive and not like many of the European SUV s i e  Freelander   Discovery which give a choppy ride and certainly do not have all the extra s thrown in as standard  I test drove a 3 0 litre Auto which i thought was great but here in the u k  petrol at about  6 0 a gallon makes this affordable only if money is no object  The only other option was the 2 0 litre Manual which i opted for and ordered before test driving as the dealer did not have one available  I have had the car 3 weeks now and it is GREAT   in everyway  Easy to handle   Park and reverse  Excellant driving position   Loads of room   Plenty of storage and cup holders which are not common here in the U K  but which i think are a must  It tows fine   feels stable although the 2 0 litre engine has to work at it  This is the first vehicle of this type i have owned and i don t think i could go back to a normal saloon which i had before  Overall Great car and as i headed this up A BREATH OF FRESH AIR for us normally stuffy Brits
