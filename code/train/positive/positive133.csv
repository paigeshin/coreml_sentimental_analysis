 This was the first new car I ever purchased  it was my dream car  My 1995 Ford Mustang 2 Door Coupe was Forest Green with Saddle  tan  interior  The 6 cylinder 3 8 liter  145 horsepower engine was all the power I needed  Sure I would have liked to have had a bigger  beefier engine  but did I need it  No  I have the two speeding tickets to prove it I only had my car a couple weeks and we decided to take it on a  quot road trip quot  up to the mountains  to show it off to my parents  It handled like a dream  with 3 passengers that engine pulled us right up the Sierra Nevada Highways  passing people left and right It was a great commute car  with good gas mileage  I could go a week  traveling 60 round trip miles a day  on one tank of gas  The only draw back for this car was the comfort level for long trips  As long as you were driving it was fine  but the passengers were not as comfy  The head rest on the front seats were to far back to recline and enjoy the ride  The back seat area was small  Only a petite woman could sit back there comfortably for any long period of time We traded in my Mustang for a 1997 Ford Explorer when my due date approached  It was going to be too difficult to get a child in and out of the back seat  Let alone all the  quot stuff quot  that goes with one in the trunk area  I really miss my car  and breathe a sigh of regret every time I see one on the road  Hopefully one day in the future we can get another one  I will bet my daughter would love one when she starts driving Fourteen more years  wonder if I can wait br br
