 I had the opportunity to rent a fully loaded 4wd  4 0L  Edge edition Ranger supercab for 10 days recently  I was traveling through Northern California and camping in Big Sur with stops in San Francisco and Lake Tahoe Initially  I was surprised that the Ranger I d reserved was such a highly optioned model  I d been expecting a 2wd  3 0L V 6  extended cab model  Apparently this is the only way Budget equips Rangers rented from SFO  This was a pleasant surprise  but a surprise nonetheless  especially considering I d been quoted a rate of  18 00 day  Truly a bargain The white Edge edition is a sharp looking vehicle  with the performance to back up it s aggressive looks  The first thing I noticed when getting in was how stiff the seats seemed compared to my S 10 pickup  I felt like I was sitting in a truck  The lateral support seemed pretty much nonexistent  The interior was handsomely trimmed in typical Ford style  Driving the vehicle out of the garage one of the first things I noticed was a lot of tire noise from the knobby Goodyear Wranger RT S tires   This may not be the best long haul driver  I thought to myself During the course of more than 1000 miles of driving in various conditions including some off road runs around Big Sur  I found the truck to be a trusty friend  It corners competently on the highway  with the power to pass and accelerate from a stop quickly  Driving the winding roads on PCH around Big Sur  the truck felt solid and well planted  Switching to 4wd was a seamless affair with a simple dash mounted dial  The 5 speed automatic transmission was also faultless and very smooth The driving impression is quite different from my 1998 S 10  which feels so carlike in most driving situations  The Edge never let you forget it was a tall truck  The trade off for all the power was woeful gas mileage  15 17 mpg range  in all driving conditions  With gas costing  2 00 and more per gallon for regular in many California cities  it made for some painful gas stops  The 2 forward opening doors on the extended cab were very welcome  The chassis also seemed very tight and squeak free despite the large openings the truck s doors could provide  Anyone who has these 4 doors will wonder how extended cabs ever did without them Overall  I would say this is a very versatile vehicle with good looks and strong performance  The unremarkable seats  tire noise and poor mileage might make it tiresome to live with for some people  The 6 disc CD player also decided it wanted to keep my cds just before I returned the vehicle  I had to fiddle with it for more than 10 minutes before it decided to eject my cds  For the type of people in the Wranger  Xterra demographic  however  this is a great vehicle
