 I utilize a F 150 XL Model through work  It s a base model featuring a 5 Speed  Titan V 8 and a tape deck  This truck is abused  Numerous people drive it for deliveries  getting supplies  and weekend use  There is no doubt in my mind it takes a beating  I have to say it s durability has impressed me  Our truck is approaching 40K in mileage and the only work required has been regular maintenance and self induced  The later primarily refers to several flat tires  a broken front grill  someone bumped on of our bigger trucks  and a sheared off Lug on the right rear wheel  You can see what I mean about abuse  However  the drive train remains quite solid  Considering the base model  and I drive it in workboots  the thing picks up quite good  and breaks loose quite easy  Rain is the biggest enemy  as with most trucks  That big V 8 will break the wheels loose quickly and efficiently  The ride is comfortable considering it s work status  It equipped with a basic cloth benchseat  I ve made several day long runs in it and it could be more comfortable  but it could be a lot worse  The lack of cruise control is a bigger factor to me than the seats  The bed is sized to hold most of what we need  The tailgate easily disconnects if necessary  nice feature  This truck has an excellent utility aspect  and I would recommend it to any fleet or local shop  However  if your shopping for a personal truck  I would recommend a better equipped model  The build quality is certain to be the same  but you don t want that bench seat br br
