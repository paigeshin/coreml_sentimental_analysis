 I 146ve had my  14686 Ranger since 1996  I bought it for  700 and consider it a great investment  I 146m a contractor on the side  a salesman full time  One of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up  Sales have been slower lately but are building up again  I stay busy doing jobs smaller than most guys take on but no matter the economy I cringe at the thought of covering a new truck payment every month  Why pay someone else money I made  Let 146s see  buy new truck and throw money away  I do electrical  plumbing  dry walling  tile work and more  This truck has been great for all of it  Tax deduction  I 146ve two great tax deductions I get to tuck into bed at night when I 146m not out on a job late  Then I 146d also rather spend some time with my tax deductions  girl in 1998 and boy in 2001  rather than running ragged all the time  I 146ve got about 130 000 miles on this little critter and figure I 146ll drive it until it falls apart around me  One day I 146ll close the door and the thing will disintegrate into a cloud of dust  I 146ll rummage through it and pick out my tools  I do believe the next work truck will be a van  though  But  off topic One of the first things I had to do was have the exhaust system replaced    300 for the whole thing  Another  200 for a topper   I was ready to go to work and not letting the entire neighborhood when I came   went This never was a beautiful truck  It was originally dark brown with a tan interior  But now the rust has given it a two tone color scheme  The only body panel that has not been eaten away at least partially by rust is the hood  All the wheel wells are slowly expanding  The right pivot point for the end gate has fallen off  I found it and have it on a shelf in the garage  Believe it or not  I 146d rather drive this than a new truck  I never worry about door dings in the parking lot at Lowe 146s Menard 146s Home Depot  I cut shingles on the hood and use the side panels to knock concrete out of my mixing trough  Why  Because I can   it 146s convenient  Nothing I do to this truck will reduce its value at all because it is far from the showroom Nor has this truck ever been considered powerful  The 2 3L engine is sufficient to keep it moving with traffic  but not to pull anything large and continue to do so  I 146ve driven from Des Moines to Chicago with it to do a basement finish for my brother in law and even in Chicago traffic I was able to hold my own  I 146m never  147chosen 148 at stop lights but people give me room when I signal I 146m changing lanes  I think other drivers see the rust and are afraid that if they get too close it 146ll jump onto their car  too  A POX ON YE  Fine Once when I rented a lift and was backing it into position up a driveway  the clutch began smoking  A lot  It  150 the clutch not the smoke   lasted another year or so until I could barely make it up my own driveway  So  I dropped the transmission   with someone who knew what they were doing   and replaced the clutch for about  300  The mechanic who does the work on my car quoted me about  750  I hate paying retail  The only issue I 146ve had with the interior noise level  150 it 146s tolerable even at Interstate speeds  150 was on that trip to Chicago  I turn the radio up to cover the engine noise  Even though I say it is tolerable  that doesn 146t mean you can hold conversation with a passenger  I 146d also noted a great deal of wind noise from the passenger door and could see daylight through the top seal  So  at the next rest area I stopped and tweaked the door a bit  It wasn 146t quite enough  So at the next exit I tweaked it again  Harder  That tightened the door to the point that it 146s difficult to open  But  the wind noise is gone  I like the bench seat  It really is comfortable  Compared to the seats in my sales car  2000 Taurus  it is very comfortable  On the longer trips it doesn 146t limit you with bolsters or even attempt to cradle you  It just supports you and does this job very well  I keep my cordless drill   Sawsall in the space behind the seat  I 146ve also mounted a first aid kit behind my head over the seat  It hangs down over the window but doesn 146t obstruct the view  Since the seat doesn 146t have whiplash protection  the first aid kit has a dual use  Perhaps someone will encourage me to purchase a newer vehicle someday by rear ending this truck  It wouldn 146t take much so I hope they 146re gentle The rear view mirror sought new employment one day out of the blue  It came groveling back from under the seat and now sits close to the end gate pivot in the garage  The view out the back is limited by stuff in the topper anyway  I 146ve quite a lot of tools neatly boxed in those cheap  plastic 50 gallon bins  They keep the tools out of sight and small parts easy to find  I 146ve tested the payload capacity a few times too many  The tires have been the only suspension on the rear at least a couple of times   once with a too large load of shingles and the second with a way too heavy tree trunk  A couple of other times since then I 146ve had the rear bumper drag on the way out the driveway  It doesn 146t take as much as it used to to do that  The right front brake hangs up once in a while  I believe I need new calipers but don 146t feel like dropping the money into the truck and don 146t have the time to spare anyway  I just avoid using the parking brake and things work fine  The windshield is cracked from a large extension ladder being strapped to the roof of the truck  I just laid it over the top of the topper and roof of the truck and strapped it down in the front and back  It caused a bit of stress on the roof and some cracks developed  Iowa doesn 146t have laws concerning cracked windshields so I 146ll let it go until it becomes a problem  I carry the ladder very rarely as it looks like a hook   ladder truck coming down the road  Well  perhaps more like a tight contractor who won 146t spring for a ladder rack The windshield wipers don 146t like to be too cold  If the day is under freezing they need some time for the engine to warm them up a bit  Not a huge deal  Most old trucks have a quirk or two  this one just has a dozen or so  A more annoying thing is that when the humidity is high or especially if there 146s been heavy dew  the truck is very reluctant to start  I 146ve replaced the starter twice  The first time was because it was worn out  The second time because a damaged flywheel was actually the culprit the first time  The second time I opted for the biggest starter that would fit in there  Teamed with an oversized battery what 146s  147reluctant 148 for me may be  147not at all 148 for someone else  I don 146t know  I 146ve also noted a lot of leaves end up in my vents  Then  occasionally the blower shreds them fine enough that they blow out but normally I need to dig them out  I gave up and tore the vent louvers off the dash  Now the leaves just blow whole out of the chute while I 146m driving down the road  Just wait until this winter when the heater really gets going  Picture flaming leaves 133 Anyway  the vent louvers have joined the collection on the shelf in the garage This may be related to the leaf thing  but when it rains I 146ve noticed that the floor on the passenger 146s side is wet  I just make certain anything that I put on the floor isn 146t going to be damaged by moisture  copper fittings   small bins of screws  I 146ve had a couple of cardboard boxes disintegrate with a couple of pounds of screws in them before I began to watch what I keep there  The bed has taken a great deal of abuse but looks pretty good  I found a bed mat in a garage I was working on one time that a previous owner had left  It keeps those plastic bins from sliding around as much  It 146s also a bit more comfortable than the metal when crawling up to reach the bin with the power tools   That 146s why I 146d like to go to a van when this truck gives up the ghost The radiator or a hose has developed a small leak  I 146m hoping it 146s a hose or clamps myself  Three cans of stop leak and it slowed down a bit more  Reflecting upon that it 146s probably the water pump  I notice this leak better in the winter as when the water mix gets too low in the radiator it doesn 146t reach the heater core and the cabin blower blows cold air  Otherwise the heater works great  You could almost scald tender skin on the hottest setting  I 146m not certain what tender skin you 146re thinking of 133 No A C but I grew up without A C and am generally fine without it when dressed in grubby clothes  On really bad days I just knock off early  You can 146t work on a roof or in an attic when it 146s that hot anyway and if you 146re in an A C controlled house or a basement then you 146re golden  150 so to speak anyway  working in the dark I get rather pasty I think the carpeting is after market  At least it looks like it  Not very well fitted either  Heck for  700 you think you 146d get something a bit better  eh  The shifter knob for the five speed transmission has fallen off a few times  No doubt from that blistering acceleration  No threading on the lever or in the knob so I wrapped electrical tape around the lever and pounded the knob onto it  No problem  Many items on this truck seem ready to jump ship  I 146m not certain why  Electrical tape fixes many things  not as well as duct tape  but I 146m more of an electrician  not a heating   air guy The dash holds note pads  gloves and assorted ends well  The blowers also contribute an odd leaf or two  There 146s a nice bin above the glove that is at least as big as the glove box itself and that is great for the smaller things I don 146t need in my pouches but need to have along  The glove box is the tip out variety and doesn 146t hold much  It also doesn 146t always want to stay closed  On harder bumps it will fall open and try to steal items from the bin above it  It takes two or more tries to get it to stay closed again  Even while closed it looks like it 146s threatening to open  A cautionary glance stops it but it seems to be muttering to itself even as it stays closed  Insurance and licensing are almost silly   50 per year for registration   240 per year for decent insurance coverage  Again  one of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up  This truck does it well When I was an employee  we had most everything delivered  This truck was more than sufficient  Now that I work on my own  I 146ve learned that I personally need something that can carry a bit more  A   ton or one ton van would be right  Would I recommend this to you  I guess you need to evaluate what you 146re going to use it for and what you 146re willing to put up with  I 146m out to impress exactly no one  Now  if you need more cargo room  more tonnage  towing power I 146d certainly get something else  If you want a good solid truck to occasionally take a new bed home for yourself or your neighbors  then this truck is plenty  You won 146t catch too many new truck owners hauling dirt or garden manure in their new truck  I 146ve no qualms The decision is  of course  up to you
