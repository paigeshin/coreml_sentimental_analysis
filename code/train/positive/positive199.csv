 My parents own a brand spankin new Ford Explorer and I can not believe the extra qualities it has compared to other SUV s  My parents bought this vehicle because of its overall power and luxury  It has a big triton V 8 engine that provides enough power for this vehicle  On our Explorer we have the Eddie Bauer package which adds more luxury inside of the vehicle which is almost to much to better  I think that the options this vehicle gives you are almost unreal  It also comes with a 4x4 package which is nice for the winter time or if you want to take this vehicle off road  I recommend this vehicle to every person looking to buy a very nice SUV for a reasonably price br br
