 My sister got a 1999 Ford Explorer 2WD 2 Door Sport for her 16th birthday  It was a great SUV to start off with  At first  everything was great and nothing went wrong  Now from what we thought was a little problem we re ending up having a big problem  The first thing to go wrong was the back seat head rest  After it went up it didn t come back down  The Ford dealership had to send it to an upholstery shop so they could take the seat apart to get the headrest back down and they still have not fixed  It takes them 2 days just to figure out they have to order a part for this seat and they still have not gotten the part in  Next  the front passenger seat wouldn t slide up  Well after that was fixed  we had the bomb dropped on us  THE TIRES  She HAD Firestone Wilderness tires on her Explorer and they ve been recalled  The tread is coming off and the tires are worthless  so to speak  The worst part is is that we are in the 3 phase of the recall so it will not be until next year that we can have her tires replaced  It had been bearable until we found this out  I do  however recommend the Explorer  I just recommend that you check the serial number on the tires before you make your final decision  Other than these few problems  the Explorer has been a joy to drive br br
