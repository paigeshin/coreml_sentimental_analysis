 If you are a person who needs an all around versatile vehicle  then the Ford F 150 Extended Cab pick up is what you want I recently purchased one  and it is the first full sized pick up I have ever owned  I have 3 children  and did not think a pick up would be a practical choice for me  considering the fact that you need room in a family vehicle for the entire family I had always borrowed a pick up from my families shop when I needed to haul a load of wood  hay  etc Much to my surprise  this pick up had MUCH more room than the sport utility vehicle I had previously been driving  and it has a third door  which completely erases the problem of trying to load kids  groceries  saddles  or whatever you need to put in the back seat  Three seatbelts in the back ensured the safety of ALL my children  and in front are 2 air bags  with a shut off for the passenger side air bag in case you have a fourth child The rear seat is also split  and can be folded down entirely or independently  depending on how much room you need  and when folded  it is a solid metal bottomed cargo area It has a V 8 engine  with a convenient switch to take you easily from 2 wheel drive to 4 wheel drive  it is the most comfortable and easy to drive vehicle I have ever owned  and I can haul anything  I haul wood  hay  wood chips  gravel  rocks the pretty kind  I am an avid rock hound  lumber  you name it  you have the room and the power to haul just about anything So the next time someone says   quot Pick ups are a mans work vehicle quot  you can say   quot Pick ups are for women and families too quot br br
