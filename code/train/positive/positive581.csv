 I own a 1996 Ford Explorer with leather interior and all the options  It is a classy looking SUV that is luxurious to drive  It has smooth handling and and has been very reliable  Cornering is ok but sometimes tippy on very sharp turns  Four wheel drive is excellent for winter conditions  especially slippery stop and goes I would not recommend this vehicle for someone who is planning to drive on rough terrain  It is very bumpy on rough roads and is better for road driving People who should buy this vehicle are small families  individuals who are worried about driving in winter conditions  and anyone who camps or participates in outdoor activities such as skiing or biking Overall  this is a great vehicle to own because it is a nice ride  is asthetically pleasing  is good in winter conditions  and has luxurious options
