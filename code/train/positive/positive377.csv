 After 9 years and 196 000 miles it s time to retire the Escort 3 door  I cant say enough about this little car  I bought the car back in  94 for 13 000  After 9 years of commuting logging over 196 000 miles it s time for a new car  Why you ask  The family does not fit in this little economy car anymore  It s still running great and ready to go  The only repairs to this car over the years have been 1 wheel bearing  1 timing belt  1 battery  and the head light bulbs  I cant believe it  All these years and so few repairs  The ride of the little Escort is on par with most cars in this class  Handling is good at speeds even up to 90mph  The fuel economy is amazing  This little car was outfitted with the 1 9L in line 4 mated to a 5 speed manual transmission  The best highway mileage I have recorded is 41mpg on a trip from Reno NV to Salt Lake City UT  The air conditioning works great  although there is a noticeable lack of power when the air conditioning is on  The seats are comfortable for the day to day driving  but for the long trips bring a pillow  The controls are all located in right places  no hunting for missing controls  The trunk and fold down seats are perhaps the best feature of all  I used this car for commuting around the San Jose area as a Computer Networking consultant  For one particular job I needed to haul some computers to Oakland  I was stunned when I fit 11 computers into the back of this little wonder  Over the years this little car served me well and I would not hesitate in getting another one The stereo is not great  The little speakers that come in the Escort are junk  If you like music  go out and get some good speakers installed  The Transmission is great with one exception REVERSE  Sometimes reverse can be a little tricky to engage  This problem was present from the first day I got the car  Every mechanic I spoke to said this is normal for these cars  No big deal though  just put the car in first gear before you try to put it in reverse  Doing this will get the gears to line up  and reverse is ready to use
