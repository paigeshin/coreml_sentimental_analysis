 In 1996 my husband and I  having just recently had a baby set out to get ourselves a new car since the  89 Escort we had needed some work  Not having a lot of money we decided to look at used vehicles  The car dealer had a few  94 Ford Aspires on the lot and we decided to try them We test drove a nice  burple  color one as it became known to us since the color was a cross between blue and purple  We went and talked price and drove away the proud new owners of a 4 door  94 Aspire The interior of this car was roomy enough for our family of three  My husband is tall at over 6  and never had a problem in this car  This car actually seems bigger then the Escort to us Many people have complained about the power in this car  While we found that you could not expect 0   60 very quickly it did perform well enough for us  I mean we are not racecar drivers  The only thing was to get enough merging power we would have to turn off the A C  This car diligently moved us from California to Louisiana and then to Alabama with no problem  Our biggest problem with the car   The windshield hummed at any speed over 55 Unfortunately  at 60 000 miles  a large promotion  and the thought of another child we decided that it was time for us had come for us to trade our Aspire for something larger with more options  It was a very sad moment for us as we had seen a lot and done a lot in that Aspire of ours  She had never let us down  We traded her in and said our goodbyes and before we even took delivery of our new car her new owners who bought her right after we traded it in were driving her out  We watched her drive down the road and I must say it was like watching the end of an era for us On a lighter note  we do see our Aspire around town every now and then  It always perks my spirits to see her  Even better yet  it means she still is running br br
