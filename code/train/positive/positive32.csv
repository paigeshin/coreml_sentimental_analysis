 First off  let me state that I do not own this 1995 Ford F150 4wd XLT Supercab Pickup that I am about to review  My best friend owns this truck  I borrowed it from him recently on a 320 mile round trip to pick up an item I bought out of state  Some of you are probably asking yourselves  how can he write up a review on a vehicle that he doesn t even own  Let me add though  that my job provides me the opportunity to drive A LOT of different makes of light duty trucks  1 2 ton  3 4 ton  and 1 tons  These trucks are work trucks  I do not baby them  I use them  With that said  here is my opinion of the 1995 Ford F150 This particular Ford is a teal colored  yuck  short box with 73 000 miles on the odometer  It is fitted with the optional 5 8 liter  351 c u  V8  mated to an automatic overdrive transmission  This engine provided very adequate power  I set the cruise at 75 mph and the truck held it  even going up steep inclines that brought tractor trailers and vw buses to a crawl  The automatic transmission seemed to be very smooth and precise during shifting  With the cruise control set at 75 mph  the tach read a very respectable 2200 rpm  I was very impressed with this since engine life would probably be extended with such a low engine rpm  I have no complaints whatsoever with the engine and tranny in this Ford  I would recommend this engine over the smaller 5 0 liter  302 c u  V8  especially if you plan on pulling a trailer of any size  Also  I checked the mileage on my 320 mile journey  all interstate driving  I got 15 6 mpg  I would say this is par with other makes of 1 2 tons in the 1995 model year  Not as good as our 97 chevy 1 2 ton 4X4  350 c u  I use at work  I can squeeze 20 mpg out of her  This Ford contained two gas tanks to minimize gas station stops  A nice plus I thought the ride quality of this 1 2 ton Ford was quite harsh compared to other makes of 1 2 ton trucks I have driven  I could feel every crack and bump I traversed on the interstate  I could even feel the vibrations through the steering wheel  I couldn t blame the poor ride on bad shocks  since I know my buddy just replaced the shocks  Maybe the poor ride quality could be contributed partially to the type of tires he is running  I don t know  Secondly  I thought there was more road noise entering the cab then was acceptable  Thirdly  I found this truck  quot wanders quot  When this truck would wander into a rut on the interstate  it would pull suddenly to one side than the other  If one wasn t holding onto the steering wheel with both hands it could take you by surprise  I don t know what caused this  tires suspension  This model was equipped with a 60 40 split seat in front  I found the seats to be fairly comfortable  The driver was treated to a power lumbar support  In the center of the seat there was a fold down console  This was very nice  It contained 2 cup holders able to accommodate my rather large coffee mug  The console also had compartments inside for currency  notebooks  cell phones  etc  I am 6 2 quot  and found legroom to be acceptable  Rear passenger legroom is limited though  as is with any extended cab pickup  The small fold down back seat is designed for small children  not adults I did not care for the stock sound system  It was an AM FM stereo cassette w  four speakers  Sound quality was very poor and could not drown out the excessive road noise that this Ford exhibited  The buttons were extremely small making it very easy to hit the wrong button  Also  the stereo was placed in a very awkward position in the dash  I had to reach very far toward the center of dash to turn channels  This could prove to be very hazardous when driving  First thing I would do if this was my vehicle is upgrade the stereo with an after market system  I had the opportunity to use both the air conditioning and the heater on my short 1 2 day trip  gotta love Wyoming  I found both worked fantastic  No complaints in this department This truck was equipped with the power window door package  I found the power windows locks to be very efficient  The windows rolled up and down very fast  I own a 1987 K5 Blazer and my power windows are pathetically slow  So  this was a welcome change In terms of safety features  this truck contained rear anti lock brakes  don t quite understand the reasoning here  and a driver side airbag  A passenger side airbag was non existent  In terms of reliability of this truck  my friend has had darn good luck thus far  Like I mentioned above  the truck now has 73 000 miles on the clock  He has had some problems with keeping the truck aligned  might be linked to the  quot wandering quot  problem  and front wheel bearings going out  I believe that is the only problems he has had in the four years he has owned the truck  I personally like the styling of this 95 F150 better than the new styling of the Ford F150 s  But  if it was my choice I would choose the 95 Chevy 1 2 ton over this Ford
