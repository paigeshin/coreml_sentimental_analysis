 I bought a Taurus GL with power package  cruise  automatic  cell phone  6 disc cd changer in late 97  It was a previous rental with 15000 miles so I was able to defray some of the initial depreciation  and have been satisfied every day since  I have always been a Honda man and have generally steered clear of american cars for their rapid depreciation  however when we had our second child I found it difficult to go on long trips with the stroller  port a crib  luggage  and various other newborn necessities due to the limited trunk space that Honda s have I started looking around at larger cars  I wanted something with a v6  plenty of room  comfortable on long trips  limited outside noise there is nothing worse than listening to the wind outside for hours and hours on long trips cruise and power amenities and a cell phone in case of emergencies I got all of that with the Taurus  with plenty to spare  It is plenty roomy the trunk is nothing short of Huge  very comfortable on long trips  I can take all of the hills with ease  a definite joy to drive  My one suggestion would be too consider one with a little bit of mileage as long as it has been cared for to cut down on depreciation  I was looking at a new 97 when I bought mine with most of the same features for 24Grand  I picked up mine with 15000 miles for 15Grand  Can you see the initial depreciation on these vehicles  I currently have 50 thousand miles on mine  I take it in for regular maintenance and have had no serious problems  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a family who enjoys traveling br br
