 What does my Ford F 150 4x4 Offroad Have in common with Submarines  Airplanes  and 18 wheelers I ve flown my f 150 airborne many times  I ve driven in water over the hood I have the pictures  I ve towed overloaded Trailers  I ve chased coyotes through rough terrain  I ve loaded the truck with over twice the weight rating I even put in a supercharger and pushed the 4 6 liter overhead valve Triton V8 engine s power way past its design limits  It s been to the shop for oil  tires  brakes  plugs  a rear end oil seal  and one O2 sensor in 90 000 miles  We consistently choose our F 150 for Long trips over our 2000 F 250 and our 94 300ZX  It has the most sophisticated suspension of any truck I know Don t let that scare you  its been VERY durable  It rides like a Cadillac on the road  but handles bumps  rocks  mud  gravel  like a racing 4x4  It holds onto turns in a gravel road very well  Doesn t slide sideways The interior is very comfortable  Fully adjustable seats and steering wheel  Although the gauges are out of view with the steering wheel lowered all the way  The three door system and small rear seats are great for kids  but I wouldn t subject an adult to a very long drive back there  Colder air  it was 110 this summer  than the 2000 F 250 My biggest complaint about the drive system is the lack of limited slip  If you get one wheel in a muddy ditch  it will spin in the mud and rob torque from the other three  You can get an accessory that will eliminate the problem over  500 00  It does not have as much power or gas mileage as the Chevy  but generally  Ford does seem to forego power for reliability  and frankly  I d like it to last longer even if it isn t as fast About the  quot 4X4 Offroad quot  option  You get  17 inch wheels with recalled lug nuts  your wheels can fall off with the old ones two  quot 4X4 OFFROAD quot  stickers  A guard plate under the engine   quot Offroad quot  does have a higher book value and does sit up higher  but ask yourself if its worth the price  And remember  17 quot  tires can be hard to get and pricey br br
