 I bought this 4 wheel drive truck in February of 1995 because I liked my 1987 4WD Ranger so much  The Supercab has greater room for seat back movement and a larger  4 0 vs 2 9  engine  The only thing I wish it had is air conditioning  The autolocking hubs and push button  on the fly transfer case engagement have worked flawlessly  I get 22 24 MPG and the original 265x15 quot  tires lasted about 65K miles  amazing  One does get used to the power of the engine and it now seems a little weak  though I am sure it hasn t lost any ooomph  The cassette player started refusing to change directions and ended up  quot eating quot  tapes after 4 years  55K miles  I replaced it with a JVC radio cassette 12 CD changer from Crutchfield  I then heard vastly improved sounds from the speakers I will buy another Ranger when the time comes   or an Explorer if I no longer need a truck  If you can find this truck with reasonable mileage and price  go for it  It is terrific in snow Tis tough to give the  quot amount paid quot   below  cuz I traded in my 1987 Ranger  The price I have put in was the sticker price  Get list and invoice prices from Edmunds com before you go looking for any vehicles br br
