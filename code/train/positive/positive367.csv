 Wow  what a truck  Or should I say Car With the way the Expedition drives and handles  it does not feel like the 5 800 lbs truck it really is  I have the first model year  1997  with the 5 4L engine  and 4wd  It has the rear bench seat  towing package  dual zone climate control  and the premium sound system The steering is variable power assit  which makes driving a car of this size a lot easier  Also  the larger engine helps with accelerating from a stop  but because of the immense weight of the car  you can forget about those quick 60 80mph passing acceleration  and don t even try to pass anything going up a hill at a fast speed Don t get me wrong  this car doesn t lack any  quot oomph quot  especially when it comes to towing  You don t even feel the weight of a 3 000 lbs boat behind you  And with a 8 000 lbs towing limit  you can certainly tow large loads Of course  if you are towing anything  you want to make sure you can stop with all that extra weight  No problem  I think the Expedition probably has the best brakes in it s class  You can t stop instantaneously  but for a car of it s size  you will be very surprised at how tight and responsive the brakes are If you are going to use this car as a  quot people mover quot  also  I would very strongly recommend that you buy the dual zone climate control  The powerful fans in these systems are ideal for any climate  They can heat the car faster then an explorer can  partly because of a very strong and powerful floor blower in the back  Likewise  they can cool the car very quickly  and keep it cooled While the four wheel drive differential lacks a neutral setting  I highly doubt this will discourage most buyers from purchasing this car  The best  and most used setting by me  is the  quot Automatic Four Wheel Drive quot  In this setting  the car is supposed to enage the 4wd system when it feels tires spinning un evenly  It is a great added comfort for wet or icy roads  and can be used up to 60mph  the system will automatically detect if you are going over 60  and won t engage so as not to damage the transmission All in all  Ford really came through with an amazing successor to the Explorer br br
