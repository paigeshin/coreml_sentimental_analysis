 My wife and I were in the market for a SUV and test driving the mini SUVs  Honda CRV  Hyundai Sante Fe  Subaru Forester to name a few of the vehicles we tested  After the first mile driving the 2001 Escape XLT my wife s mind was made up  She was impressed with the visibility  power  and interior room  She was giving up her  95 Mitsubishi Diamante for a 4 wheel drive vehicle  The ride was a little stiffer but not as bad as we expected  The front seats took some time getting used to  but after a few trips we realized that they offer good support and back fatigue after 2 3 hours of driving has not been a factor We purchased our Escape in Oct  2000 and have had one recall notice that did not apply to our vehicle  We ve been averaging 16 17 miles per gallon around town and 20 21 mpg on the highway  It has been through several snow storms this winter here in CT and has performed admirably  It feels very stable at both highway speed and in bad weather  I m sure the 4 wheel independent suspension has a lot to do with this  The automatic 4 wheel drive works amazingly well  One has to try hard to get a wheel to spin on wet as well as snowy roads  The most important factor in our decision to buy this vehicle was that my wife felt completely safe driving it  After a snowy winter she still feels the same We were hoping for a little better gas mileage  but for an SUV I guess the mileage we re getting isn t all that bad
