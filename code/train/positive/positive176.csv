 After my daughter was born  I just knew that I would have to give up my need for speed  Sports cars and kids just don t mix  I began my journey for an affordable family car with a little sport  and never dreamed I would find it in the Taurus  My husband actually convinced me to test drive it  and I loved it  The back seat is wonderful for car seats  It is easy to put them in  and easy to remove them  There is child locks on the doors  and locks for the windows  The front middle seat pushes down for easy access to the kids  or folds up to reveal a neat little cubby hole for drinks  and any other junk you want to hide  The best part is that I can still get up and go  I love knowing that I can still beat those slow pokes at the red lights  and be safe in my Taurus br br
