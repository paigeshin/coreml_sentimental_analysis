 My wife and I live paycheck to paycheck just like most of the World does and our current car was falling apart quick  So when we decided that that we needed a new car we sat down and talked about what we wanted  With a tight budget we knew our choices were limited  All I wanted was an american car with a tape deck  She wanted a car with four doors  since we had a 1 year old and one more on the way  and an air conditioner since we lived in Georgia at the time  I was very stern about buying american because that s what keeps out country running and I feel that every time you buy something foreign an american worker loses his job  So we checked out the dealerships for Chevrolet  Dodge  GMC  Saturn  Ford  Jeep and many others  We looked all around looking for the cheapest and the best car we could find  Once we looked at the escort we knew that s what we wanted  It had everything we needed  Four doors for easy access to the loading and unloading of kids  an air conditioner and a tape deck for me  The interior and exterior are holding up pretty good after 4 years but nothing is child proof  The engine is still in good condition after 50 000 miles in 4 years  routine maintenance conducted regularly  but the leg room leaves something to be desired  Granted the leg room isn t anything like a Geo Metro or a ford festiva where your knees are in your chest  You have enough room to move around and not get cramps but i wouldn t try stretching out to much br br
