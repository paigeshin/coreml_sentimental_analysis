 Hi I was out in the market and I came accros with the idea of purchasing a SUV  I found none that would fit my pocket  So I had to go to an auction to get me one  This baby came along  Eddie Bauer  loaded  4X4  control track  Man  my first SUV and I had a winner  HEre s my opinion b i Exterior   On the outside this truck is a winner  Its tall  heavy and has a sporty look  The side moldings and trim add a lot of personality to it  Big all aroung glass allows you to see all over the place  Keyless entry and alarma integrated  Roof rack and a hitch ball come to make everything more appealing  Wheels and Tires  225 75 16 and beautiful 16  3 spoke chome wheels b i Engine   It has the 4 0 CID engine  Mine was 6 cylinder but there s a 8 cylinder model too  The millage on this baby was kinda high  170K miles but if you could only hear her  its like the day it rolled off the assy ine  The previous owner did a terrific job taking care of it b i Interior   Leather baby  all leather all over  front and rear seats  central and side arm rests  The instrument cluster seems somewhat not so luxury but it gets the job done  To small glove box for my taste tho  Seats are the bomb  confortable  soft and lumbar support  This is for both front seats  On the back  there s space for that trip or the groceries  A convenient jack storage space and 4 frame bolted hooks so you can strap that baby seat or a flat tire b i Extras   6 CD changer and premium sound kicks it  subwoofer integrated  Automatic antenna  Rear wiper and squirter  Premium carpet job  Rear seat radio and AC controls  Automatic climate control  Power windows and locks  Cargo Cover  off ebay  4 x 4 BABY  ALL THE WAY b i Inconveniences  so far   AC unit on all explorers had a failure called blend door actuator  Mine has it  It wont let you mix the temp for the air  its either all cold or all hot Change the shocks for a model that allows you a softer ride  Otherwise you will get yourself a  kidney milkshake Only Motorcraft plugs are recommended for Ford engines I hope this review has helped you and please rate it
