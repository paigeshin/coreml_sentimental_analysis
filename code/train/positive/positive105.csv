 I 146m personally not a big fan of large SUVs  They use massive amounts of gasoline 151mileage is generally in the low teens 151and owing to their nearly three ton weight and high bumpers constitute a danger to anyone in a smaller vehicle  especially if that vehicle is a lower riding car or minivan  Yet even I am not entirely immune to their appeal  There is something fascinating about vehicles so large  probably the same thing that is fascinating about large beasts such as elephants and hippos  and large anything for that matter  Size is impressive to the animal brain  Recently I had a coupon for a free oil change at a Ford dealer  It was supposed to be a  147fast lube 148 but with nine cars in line ahead of me it was not  So I took the opportunity to indulge my revulsion fascination complex with large SUVs by taking a 2003 Expedition for a test drive My motivations were a bit more sophisticated than I have let on  I knew that Ford had substantially revised the Expedition for 2003  The revised styling follows the path set by the 2002 Explorer  with the largest change being a less round and more massive looking front end  Most intriguing to me  steering changed from recirculating ball to rack and pinion and the live rear axle was tossed in favor of an independent rear suspension to improve handling   Handling more than any other area affects my satisfaction with a vehicle  As in the 2002 Explorer  the new rear suspension permitted a much lower load floor  promising a larger rear seat There 146s also some history here  GM used to own the large SUV market  Then Ford finally got around to introducing its own full size four door SUV in 1997  and that first Expedition was instantly a success  GM responded with its own substantially redesigned large SUVs in 2000  and they 146ve regained some of the lost ground  This intense competition for high margin sales  large SUVs command much higher prices than mid sized SUVs  but do not cost that much more to produce  explains why Ford so substantially revised the Expedition for 2003 b Styling  As with the 2002   a href content 39524011652 Explorer a b   click for my review  I like the new styling much better than the old  The rounder front fenders of the first generation Expedition  as successful as they were at adapting Ford 146s aero look to a truck  were just a bit too pretty for a truck  The new styling makes the vehicle look stronger and more up to date  rounded forms are on their way  147out 148 without resorting to an overly macho theme  i e  the Avalanche  Some people complain that the Explorer and Expedition look too much alike  I don 146t have a problem with this personally  The point of styling is not to entertain auto journalists or third parties  The point is to give owners the  147look 148 they want  If they want the  147Ford SUV look 148 and the Explorer is large enough inside  then that 146s the way to go  If they want this look  but need a larger SUV  then that 146s what the Expedition is for  No one complains that Cheerios uses the same graphics on the 15oz and the 22oz box  right  And if every different size cereal box had a different look  wouldn 146t this lead to even more confusion in the cereal aisle  By similarly styling and naming its SUVs  Ford presents a clearer image and simplifies customers 146 decision making  Finally  wouldn 146t it be worse if they looked different  and people who only needed a mid sized SUV but really liked the look of the big one were thus forced to buy more gas guzzling truck than they need  So I have no problem with Ford SUVs looking alike Inside the Expedition has also been de rounded  The round forms of the old dash are gone  replaced by a more conventional arrangement  The most prominent features of the new dash are a large swath of black plastic across the driver 146s side and Audiesque rotating metallic finish rings that adjust the volume flowing through the vents  To my eye  the latter are much more aesthetically successful than the former  I 146m not sure what all of this black plastic is for  Minimizing glare  based on the Mercedes line of thinking  The Lincoln version isn 146t similarly blessed  so even if this is the line of reasoning Ford can 146t be too committed to it  Overall  I find the interior restyle less successful Ford claims that the new truck 146s interior materials are an improvement  with VW as the benchmark  They are an improvement 151this is a nicer interior than that of the new Explorer 151but VW is still a ways off  There 146s still a large amount of hard plastic to be found here   Accommodations  Hopefully  people who buy an Expedition do so for reasons beyond an infatuation with size  To whit  hopefully they need to carry a large amount of people and or stuff over nasty roads  or even off road  Let 146s cover the capacity issue first The Expedition is a big vehicle in all dimensions  length  wide  and height  This permits a large interior  even after allowing for generous ground clearance  Now  just about any car claims to fit three adults in the back seat  However  few have enough shoulder room to fit three comfortably  i e  shoulders not crammed into each other  middle person not sitting on a high  hard lump  etc  No problem here  All three rows have enough shoulder room for three adults to fit with little or no touching  A split bench is standard on the first two trim levels up front  so an Expedition can be configured to carry nine people  The upper trim lines  including the top of the line Eddie Bauer I drove  are fitted with buckets and a center console  I found the driver 146s seat fairly comfortable  especially after I deflated the lumbar support  an earlier driver had pumped it all the way up  I found the driving position much better than that in the current Explorer  In the Explorer  the windshield header and sun visors intruded on my vision  It was like a billed hat I couldn 146t take off  In the Expedition  I sat well above the dash  affording an excellent view out all around  yet the top of my vision was also unblocked  Much  much better  No improvements possible here  Huge mirrors were also much appreciated Many cars these days do not provide enough interior storage  No problem with the Expedition I drove  The center console  which reduces seating capacity to eight  has a HUGE storage compartment in it  A small dog could be stored in there or  more likely  a laptop computer and or good sized purse  This compartment was topped by a padded leather armrest  Also nice  Smaller storage areas are scattered throughout the interior The Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove had the  147climate control 148 seats  These include not only heating  but also air conditioning  each with five strength settings  I set the seat A C to  1475 148 but never noticed a difference  I would suggest saving  625 by forgoing this option  except it 146s the only way to get heated seats  and these can be very nice to have on cold mornings with leather  You 146re call  just know the seat A C isn 146t worth much In the second row  the truck I drove had a bench split in three pieces  The middle piece can be slid forward  to position it closer to the front row  something parents with small children might like  Two captains chairs separated by a center console with a large storage compartment  as in the Lincoln Navigator  are a  795 option  Be aware that while the seats fold the console will not  so with all seats folded it sticks up a few inches above the otherwise nearly flat load floor  Second row seat comfort is pretty good  definitely better than that in most smaller SUVs and minivans  The seat cushion is nearly high enough to provide good thigh support  The cushion is padded and contoured enough so you don 146t feel you 146re sitting on a board  To get to the third row  either outboard section of the second row tilts forward in two fairly easy steps   Not quite easy enough for children to manage  which might not be a bad thing The real surprise is in the third row  Ford 146s main reason for eating the approximately  200 additional cost of an independent rear suspension was to avoid packaging a center differential with 10 148 or so of travel  This permitted the floor to be lowered nine inches  a huge amount  This lower floor permits two things  First  it permits a surprisingly roomy third seat  Now  many vehicles these days offer a third row seat  including many minivans and an increasing number of SUVs  I 146ve sat in many of these third row seats  I didn 146t sit in them any longer than I had to  though  They tend to be uncomfortable  and they tend to be mounted so close to the floor that my knees are at chest level  I don 146t like sitting like this  In the Expedition  in contrast  the seat cushion is generously sized and padded and is mounted high enough above the lower floor that I had plenty of thigh support  move even than in the second row  Overall  I found the third row seat to be the most comfortable in the vehicle  more comfortable than the second seats in most alternatives are far ahead of any third row seat I 146ve sampled  Among SUVs  only the even larger Suburban comes close  Quite an achievement The lower floor also permits this large  comfortable seat to fold completely into it  leaving a flat load surface behind  Ford faced a choice here  They could have used the lower floor to expand cargo volume by making the seats removable  as before  They elected instead to keep cargo volume constant 151and thus substantially less than a minivan s 151and eliminate the need to remove any seats  ever  I suspect the great majority of buyers will favor this decision  as removing and storing seats tends to be quite inconvenient  For maximum cargo volume  though  a minivan remains a better choice  as the reduced ground clearance and removable seats permit a taller cargo area My test vehicle had the  455 power folding third row option  Worth the  455  Probably not to me  but I 146d suggest personally evaluating the effort involved in the non power version b On the Road  The revisions for 2003 have added a few hundred pounds to an already hefty vehicle  So even with the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter V8 acceleration is just adequate with a moderate load  By this I mean it felt neither underpowered nor equipped with power to spare  It moved as quickly as I wanted to  which admittedly is not too quickly  this being a large vehicle   The   a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a b  is about equally powerful  the GM SUVs have an edge here  Towing a heavy load and or carrying a full load of passengers might lead some people to desire more power  but as I did neither I cannot say  I can say that even when pushed the engine sounded quieter and more sophisticated than past Expeditions and competing GM products  With the accelerator floored  the transmission shifted well short of the redline  at about 5500 RPM  perhaps because going above that level on an engine with a low power peak makes no sense Handling was another pleasant surprise  The steering and brake efforts were nicely firm where they used to be overly light  Roll in turns is moderate  Unlike past Expeditions  I no longer felt I was driving a boat  Not a sports car  either  but I generally felt the new Expedition could be handled with adequate precision and  perhaps most important  a sense of control  Overall  its handling felt similar to that of the Toyota Sequoia  Sadly  the ride is not quite up to the almost Lexus like Sequoia 146s or even the Tahoe s  Over some surfaces the generally composed if not quite luxurious ride felt a bit jittery  though never uncomfortably rough  Still  I never felt the degree of body on frame shimmer that turned me off the current Explorer  Overall  ride qualoty is adequate  but I expect better The interior is fairly quiet  even at highway speeds  with one qualification  Whenever the A C was on  at any setting  a loud blower stayed on at the rear of the vehicle  I tried and failed to find a way to cut this blower off without turning the A C completely off  I think this blower recirculates air  pulling it through a vent at the very back  but even turning off  147recirc 148 didn 146t kill it  There has got to be a better way  On the positive side  the climate control system appears well up to handle the task of heating and cooling all three rows of this large vehicle   Pricing  The moderately loaded Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove carried a sticker of  45 190  Yes  quite shocking  But corrective actions are possible  The new  147safety canopy 148  airbag to protect the first and second rows in a rollover  and  147AdvanceTrac 148  stability control  are impressive safety features  but together add nearly  1 400 to the sticker  I 146ve already mentioned the climate controlled seat and power folding seat options  another  1 080  Not yet mentioned is the nicely sized but  800 moonroof  Yet more can be saved by going with the XLT trim  where the luxury of leather is still available  Equip an XLT to   a href content 68354674308 Honda Pilot EX a b  levels  and the sticker drops under forty  Still nine grand over the smaller but in some ways nicer Honda  but more help is on the way  The Honda sells at or above sticker  while according to Edmunds Ford dealers typically accept four grand under sticker  Add in Ford 146s current  2 500 rebate  and the likely transaction price for a still well equipped Expedition comes to just over  33 000  Suddenly the price seems quite reasonable  doesn 146t it  Even further reductions are possible by doing without leather  front buckets  and so on GM s full size SUVs  such as the   a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a b  tend to cost a bit more than the Expedition  For reasons discussed in my review of the Yukon  I prefer the Ford The   a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a b  costs much more than the Ford or GM SUVs  even though dealers are finally discounting them  The big Toy is more refined  but low on power and not as roomy  I prefer the Ford b Last Words  Generally I 146d still recommend a smaller  more fuel efficient vehicle  but if you need to carry seven or more  adults  comfortably  there are few other choices  and those aren 146t much more efficient  For many uses  a minivan will do as well or better  but off road and or travel over uneven or unplowed snow covered roads can justify the space robbing  weight adding ground clearance of the Expedition  With these qualifications  I can recommend this vehicle  With the changes for 2003  the seating comfort  interior versatility  and handling feel now exceed the closest competition  Acceleration  some areas of handling  and ride quality still lag  but among large SUVs this is now my favorite b Update November 2003 b This fall Nissan has entered the large SUV arena with its Pathfinder Armada and Dodge has introduced a new  singificantly larger Durango  After driving both my preference for the Expedition remains  though the Dodge is a close second  The new Durango is much quicker than the Expedition  feels more maneuverable  rides better  and costs less  Its disadvantages include a less comfortable third row  less shoulder room  and a cheap looking interior  The Nissan is also much quicker than the Ford  but its chassis feels very trucky and its interior quality is abysmal for a  40 000 vehicle I ve noticed that Expeditions  front wheels are often thickly coated with black brake dust  They appear to have a problem in this area  If you must always have a clean looking car  plan on washing this one s wheels often My reviews of related vehicles b a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a b   equivalent to
