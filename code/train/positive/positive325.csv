 I personally never owned or liked Fords until my husband and I went shopping for vehicles  I was a GMC kind of gal and was really looking more at the GMC Suburbans  My husband is a Ford fanatic and has owned Fords all his life  I didn t like his F 150 because of the leather seats and even though it was a 3 door  it was too small for us and his 3 kids  On this trip we went into a dealership and I was looking around while he arranged some maintenance for his pick up  I actually liked the look of the Expedition  and was asked if I would like to test drive it  I said  quot sure quot  knowing my heart was set on a Suburban  I LOVE the way the Expedition handles and the comfort level while driving  It was perfect and it opened my eyes  It handles and rides like a car  The seating is more comfortable than any SUV we had previously driven and the adjustable pedals are a blessing  The back seats are even comfortable  The third row seats are fine as long as you don t try to put a 6  tall person back there  a teenager or two would fit back there comfortably  The only thing I don t like about this SUV is the small amount of space behind the 3rd row seats  I guess that is why there is a luggage rack on top  We opted for the 2 wheel drive model as we live in Arizona and don t venture much in snow  That is where the posi trac rear end comes in handy  It senses slipping and the posi trac kicks in  Hubby really liked that feature and was glad to have had it while going up through the Colorado mountains  I think this is the perfect car for families wanting to travel in comfort or for people wanting to start a family sometime soon  The automatic locking doors are perfect for keeping small children in tow while trying to remove groceries and such  This feature also keeps the curious kids from accidently opening the door while the vehicle is moving  An excellent choice in my book  Lots of other features and goodies are available but my advice would be to test drive one and fall in live with it on your own br br
