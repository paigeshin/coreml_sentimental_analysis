 I got a 1991 Ford Mustang GT from my parents back in 1991 for my senior year  They always told me they would buy me and my sister one good car to go to college on and that was it  After that I would have to buy the next one  Little did I know that I would still be driving this car almost 10 years later  Well  that s exactly what I am doing and I haven t had it in the shop for more than minor work ever  I have never had to take it to the shop to do any kind of work on the engine  transmission  or other major parts  There are many pros to this particular car  There are also a few cons  I will list each of these below  Keep in mind that this is a 10 year old car that has run like a charm ever since I got it b Pros  1   Acceleration and speed    I have never had a problem with the acceleration of this car  In fact  it will almost go too fast  I have had it at an ungodly speed  that I do not wish to diverge here  It will get up and go with the best of them  2   Handling    I went to school at the University of Arkansas my first year of college  The road I chose to take was very windy and I loved it  Never once did I lose control of this car or even have the tires slip  I typically doubled each suggested speed limit up to around 30 mph 3   Looks    Even though this car is 10 years old  I have tried to keep it looking good  especially on the outside  I still get some looks from people while I am driving because the car demands looks from others  It is still fun to drive around town and see how many people turn their heads  This particular model was the first year Ford put five star rims on it  In my epinion  this makes the car much more appealing to the eyes b Cons  1   Cheap minor parts    I think that Ford spent all of their money on the engine and transmission  The major problem I have had with my car is minor parts breaking  I have replaced the inside and outside door handles more than once  The speedometer is broken  The hydraulics for the hatch won t hold up the hatch anymore  These are the majority of problems I have had  The door handles were just poorly made  They have some plastic parts that aren t very strong 2   Service at dealership    I know this isn t really dealing with the car  but our local dealership is very hard to deal with  It is Smith Ford in Conway  Many times they refused to fix something that they actually screwed up  I had them put on a new door handle many years ago and they scratched the paint  They agreed to repaint the door  but it had new paint on it  The rest of the car had paint that was around four years old  It didn t match and you can still tell it today 3   Spare tire    I know this is very minor  but I really wish they would have included a regular sized spare tire with the car  The donut tire is really small and  if you were in a bind  you can t drive it very fast So  there are a few pros and cons to the 1991 Ford Mustang  I feel that the pros heavily outweigh the cons  Yes  I would like to have a new car  but I m not getting rid of my pony  I plan on keeping it forever  I am going to rebuild it  fix the minor things that are wrong with it  and get a new paint job  Then my wife and I can cruise around town in a 30  year old car that looks brand new  Actually  I hope one of my kids wants to drive it when they get old enough br br
