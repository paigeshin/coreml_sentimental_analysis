 Buying my first car four years ago I searched high and low to find what I thought to be the  quot perfect car quot   for my needs   400  and one lemon later  I realized that I needed to be a bit more circumspect when searching for a used car  I sifted advice from a dozen sources  read books and did a lot of looking around  My decision was to buy a  92 Ford Taurus with 119 000 miles as much as for the excellent offer as for the technical knowledge I d gained about the vehicle  A bit of background first on buying used cars  This is surely not comprehensive  One owner is always a plus  If you can find an older person who is willing to sell  that is also good  More likely than not  they will have religiously taken care of regular and preventative maintenance and will not have beat on the car as young people tend to do no matter the make or model  I might add  they drive it as if it s a sports car  It s also convenient to have access to all repair records  There are stores that will even run the VIN  vehicle identification number  to determine if it has had any factory work performed on it  I ve driven my car for four years now and I have logged over 35 000 miles bringing the total to 156 000 miles  I have driven in rain sleet  snow and hail  I ve driven on new tires  bald tires  performance tires and touring tires  I ve driven cross country and I ve driven locally  My point is  I ve taken this car through every condition possible  hmm haven t made it to the autobahn yet  and I m very familiar with it Over the four years I ve owned my Taurus  I have made substantial repairs  Thus far I ve replaced all four brakes  two front disk and two rear drums  all four struts  the water pump  four tires  one window motor  and two front CV joints These repairs have been costly  but they were necessary for the mileage and their cost was certainly leveraged by the utility I received from the vehicle  Most of the miles I ve logged have been highway miles from commuting  The vehicle  fully loaded with two passengers  would attain a fuel economy of 28 miles per gallon  avg  on long trips  more than 100 miles  For the shorter work home commute it averages 22 25  Around town  the average drops  but that is to be expected from the extremely reliable 3 0 V6  The engine is well known in auto circles as an economic choice that provides power when necessary  I have found it to be a great compromise without moving to a larger V8  The car accelerates well which is not only fun to do occasionally  but necessary when making quick and aggressive driving decisions  Indeed  most reviews will give the 3 0 L a hands down appreciation over its larger counterpart  the 3 8 L  because of its reliability  the latter has often had technical problems The ride of a vehicle or how well it handles inconsistencies in the pavement without disturbing the passenger depends on many factors  Certainly  the road is a factor  but so are tires  inflation and type of struts and shocks  Many cars today have progressive shocks which adjust to the road conditions and change the ride according to speed  Though they weren t standard  I chose to have these put in when I replaced them  With properly inflated tires the vehicle provides an excellent ride even more so at high speeds as compared to a smaller vehicle  The car has power steering brakes locks trunk windows as well as AC and a 4 speaker stereo  These amenities are all standard the GL  While the car has an average wheel base  an average length compared to other vehicles of similar size  the trunk is spacious  I was able to pack modest luggage for four people into my trunk with some room to spare  While I wouldn t recommend towing with the GL  I found it to have the capacity and power to capably transport a full load of people and their luggage One inherent problem with a seemingly large number of pre 1995 Tauruses  enough that this problem had a small write up in a major automotive magazine  seems to be a knocking in the front strut area  This has occurred in my vehicle  and while I don t see any dangerous effects such as uneven tire wear or sloppy steering  this doesn t mean that it couldn t propagate in the future besides  the sound is not only annoying  it causes alarm in my passengers sort of a bump in the night Though my be loved vehicle is aging  and I may soon have to lay it to rest  it was  dollar for mile  one of the best vehicles I ve purchased  and if you as a used car buyer are in the same position I was  I would encourage you to consider the Taurus as a possible vehicle br br
