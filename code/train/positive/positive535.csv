 I bought this 1997 Ford Explorer because I wanted to upgrade to something larger than a car  but not a mini van  I can tow  should I need to  but don t on a regular basis  It s big  but not too big  I love the adjustable seats  Being only 5 2 quot  I can set my seat just the way I want to  And I can see over the hood  I have the tinted windows  which I think keep my explorer cooler in the hot  sunny south  It also provides some privacy  I find it gives me a very comfortable ride  even on long 7 hour trips  My husband drives a Lexus and says the explorer drives like a truck  but that I know  I still think it is a comfortable ride  for a truck It has pretty good pickup for a V6  I didn t get the 4 wheel drive  but plan to the next time around  At the time  I didn t think I would really need it  but it would have been nice to have  The dash is laid out really nice and I love the middle console  It holds my cd s and a tissue box holder is build in  And if I need to slide in something larger than the back cargo area  I can fold down the back seats br br
