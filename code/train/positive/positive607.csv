  PLEASE NOTICE THIS IS A REVIEW FOR A 1998 ESCORT ZX2  NOT A STANDARD ESCORT Just recently early this year  I have the opportunity to purchase this fine automobile they call an escort ZX2  I previously owned a Geo Tracker which went completely belly up on me for the fourth time  grrr  and thought it was time for a new change  also being that I desperately needed a car for spring break  and fast  I didn t waste any time to go to the town car dealership and I checked out their used car lot  They had plenty of cars there  but I had my eye on one car in particular and that was the ZX2 I was able to purchase this car remarkably for  3000  I have been a proud owner ever since  and I have had all kinds of crazy ideas on what to do to it next  Hopefully  eventually  I plan on putting a subtle body kit that will bring the lines of the car out a little more  This car is an extremely under rated car  It drives me nuts that magazines don t talk about them much  if at all  I mean  for some reason  Ford wanted to replace this car with the Focus ZX3 which  don t get me wrong  is a great car  but so is the ZX2  Well  enough about how I feel  on with the review b LOOKS b Overall  The ZX2 offers a very tasteful  sporty lines that are a step up from its Escort Coupe counterpart  Honestly  I prefer  the ZX2 over the Escort Coupe one reason only  It looks a heck of a lot better  I mean  when you drive  you want something that will turn heads  The ZX2 hopefully will do that  Also  if the factory setup isn t everything that you were looking for in a ZX2  there are plenty of body kits available for this model  Knowing where to look is the hard part  Magazines tend to leave out this fine automobile and look past its potential in becoming an excellent custom  Wings West offers an excellent  subtle body kit that is if you have the money  This body kit  as well as many others  don t come cheap b DRIVETRAIN b The Escort ZX2 is powered by the 2 0 liter  16 valve  dual overhead cam ZETEC engine which pumps out 130 horsepower stock  This car is available with a 5 speed manual transmission  or a 4 speed automatic  This car has an incredible amount of acceleration  The only disappointing fact is that Ford put a governor at 106 mph on all ZX2 models except the s r models  which has an improved cam timing  and a speedo cluster that goes up to 150 mph instead of 120 mph like the other models  Also  the s r has 150 horsepower  This car is a limited edition car that was offered in 1999 and 2000  But with a little bit of money  you can get the same performance out of your ZX2 as you can out of the s r possibly  maybe more b INTERIOR b Inside the ZX2  you will find that there is plenty of room in the front  and viewing is excellent from inside  the car has solar glass that tints slightly to the sun  The seats are very comfortable  and provide a very smooth ride  The back doesn t have as much leg room as one would anticipate  but the seats are very comfortable  The roof is slightly low in the back which makes it slightly difficult for taller people to sit in the back   HANDLING b The car is a very responsive car  It will quite possibly turn on a dime  I don t know what else to say about it other than  it handles real good b BRAKING b Just like any car  brakes need to be serviced  I changed the brakes on my ZX2 as soon as I purchased it  So far  I can t complain about the braking  except  I did experience the brakes locking up on me when turning off of a highway  It was rather scary  Fortunately  no one was in front of me  or in the other lane  I would HIGHLY recommend getting ABS brakes as an option if it doesn t come standard  I obviously don t have them after that little incident b SAFETY b My 1998 ZX2 comes standard with driver and passenger second generation air bags  ABS was an option back in 1998  not sure if it still is now  but if it isn t  like I said before  It would be very beneficial if you do get that My ZX2 is a 1998  Even though this is a review for a 1998  the whole design of the car hasn t been altered between 1998 2002  Maybe the only difference is that  Escort  was dropped off the rear bumper  My ZX2 hasn t failed me and I got mine USED with 75000 miles on it  I haven t had a problem with it yet and hopefully I won t for a long time  My ZX2 has about every option offered for the 98 model  It has power windows  power moon roof  power mirrors  alloy wheels  rear spoiler  6 disc CD changer  memory driver seat  intermittent wipers  fog lights  did i forget anything  lol  This car is HOT  They are very affordable  and very reliable  If you haven t driven a Ford lately  maybe you should start with the ZX2  you will be hooked for life
