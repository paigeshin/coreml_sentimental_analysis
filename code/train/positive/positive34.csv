 I bought a new Ford due to the history I have with the company  I have owned 3 Ford pickups and all have lasted past 300 000 miles  with understandable maintenance I recommend this pickup for everyone who truly needs a pickup  In the first 4 months of work  this pickup has truly proven it s self  In my line of work  I go places and sometimes carry more weight than most people would even try  Believe me or not I feel this pickup could go anywhere a army jeep can  strait from the factory  The gas mileage is decent  18 20 with the 298 v 8  better than I expected  and that does not seem to change much when hauling heavy loads  5000lbs  The engine performance is ok  given it is such a small motor  I would love to have the old 460 v 8 in every pickup ever built  The ground clearance is larger than in pervious models  This pickup also has several in cab dodads that I like  Such as more comfortable seats  additional compartments  outdoor temperature indicator  and easy adjustments to it all It was difficult to find a pickup with all of my specifications that I needed and had to special order this one  I do recommend the following  hand crank windows for longevity of use  5 speed manual trans  for better mpg  less engine strain in mud and towing  and emergency push starting I do not like the new body style  although it is growing on me  The lack of front fenders with this body style allows a steady rain of mud  amp  gunk to fall on the overly large front windshield when 4 wheel drive is needed  I also do not like the car like interior set up  Although the cab is roomy  this set up wastes space and is hard to clean  Another downside of this pickup is that  unless you are a mechanic  you can not fix any major problems that may arise yourself  Just open the hood for yourself br br
