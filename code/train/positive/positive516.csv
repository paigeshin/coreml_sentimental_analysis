 The Ford Explorer was one of the best investments i have ever made  That stuff that people say about a car flipping over isn t true with this SUV  You feel safe when you re behind the wheel  The car rides smooth and is great for long trips with lots of cargo space  I ve owned this vehicle for 2 months and have had slight problems  This car really hasn t had any problems  and it s reliable  But the minor problems were both fixed by the Ford Company because of the 36 000 mile warranty  The company is fair and honest  and they really know how to treat a customer  Also  my car has been hit four times when it was parked somewhere  It has survived all four instances without even receiving a scratch  I may just be lucky  but i would say that the car is built to protect the driver  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves to drive because it is great for road trips or just cruisin  around town  It is definitely an awesome buy
