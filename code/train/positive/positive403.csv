 I drive a 2000 Mustang V6  This car gives you a lot of bang for the buck  The hood  bumpers and trunk are of a composite material which means they will not rust  It also makes the car lighter  The good part is the winter won t rust the car out  but the car is lighter   for winter driving  with this car being a rear wheel drive  put some weights and get good winter tires  if you are to drive it in the snow  Of course rear wheel drive is fun though  for going around corners The car handles well and is a dream to drive  The seats are comfy  and adjust well  The gages and interior is basic  but doesn t give you that  cheap  feel  like a typical GM car  Sometimes the dash squeaks  but only rarely  The sound system is good  even with the basic system The air conditioning is VERY good  and so is the heating  The back seat is short and not comfy for people taller than 5  4 The V6 will not win you an Indy 500  but the gas mileage is very good  and another thing   this car is sexy  You can also spend more money like any other car  but the aftermarket for the Mustang is awesome there are a lot of toys you can buy to make your Stallion fly Don t let anyone tell you Ford is junk  Ford has their problems  but so does GM  Toyota  Honda and whoever else  The difference with this car is that it is easy to get parts for  and cheap to repair  Nobody should laugh at you for owning a Mustang  Not everyone wants a rear wheel drive sports car  but if you re looking for something fun take a look
