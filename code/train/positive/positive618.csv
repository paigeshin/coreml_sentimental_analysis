 My 1998 Ford Escort has almost 36 000 on it and I must tell you I have been very happy with my car  It is a four door  and the back seat is very roomy  My kids can have their friends go with us on trips  as 3 people can fit in the back seat  The front seats tilt back enough for roomy leg room  My six foot 2 son s head does not hit the roof  It is also very good on gas  A tank of gas can last me around 150 miles  I think it is very easy to drive and compact enough to find a good parking spot  The trunk is spacious  also  We camp a lot and I can fit in the trunk all the gear we need for a weekend  including tent  sleeping bags  firewood and cooler  I plan to pass this car along to my youngest when he turns 16  I m sure it will run as well for him as it has for me br br
