 I don t even own a minivan  but I wish I did  I have a two year old and a three month old  and drive a small car  That is one tough thing to do  My father recently purchased a Windstar  and I fell in love with it I love the fact that there are climate controls in the front and back  the doors can be locked from the tailgate  the seats adjust nicely  and the windows can be rolled up after the ignition is turned off I think my favorite feature about this minivan is that the driver s seat can be moved forward to get to the back seat without having to go around to the other side  I have borrowed my dad s Windstar many times  and this really comes in handy The safety ratings on this vehicle have highly impressed me  and the ease of use has me sold  When I do buy another vehicle  it will be the Windstar  It drives great  and rides even better br br
