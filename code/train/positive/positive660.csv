 I purchased a 1999 Ford Escort SE in September  I had a Ford Escort years ago  got good mileage and very few repairs so I decided I wanted another one  This car is comfortable  gets good gas mileage  sporty  amp  attractive  I like the cruise control something I never had on a car  The rear defrost is a must and of course  air conditioning  It has an excellent heater  I love the color red the car really stands out  It has plenty of leg room and it is a perfect buy for me  I think anyone would enjoy driving this car especially students and retired people  It is economical and yet attractive  So far I haven t found anything I don t like about this car  Anyone who is used to a Lincoln probably wouldn t be suitable for this car  I purchased the 4 door which has a reclining back seat which makes it nice for hauling mostly anything within reason  I would buy this vehicle again  Ruth Anna Rote
