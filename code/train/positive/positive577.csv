 I surprised myself when I ended up buying a used 97 Escort last year  I was in the market for a new used car  but I had sworn to myself and my dad that I wouldn t get an escort  We had an 88 or 89 when I was a kid and it was one of the most atrociously ugly cars I ve ever seen  It looked like a small happy meal box on wheels  or maybe just a tanks  Well  to get to the point One afternooon I was at a used car dealership and saw a silver 97 Escort in my price range  The main reason I chose to test drive it  aside from it being silver my favorite car color  was to get my dad to stop bugging me about one  Miraculously  I realized it was a great car while I was driving it  It has decent pickup for a car in its class and has wonderful handling  I bought it that very afternoon I m still very happy with my purchase  though I ve had a few small problems with it since I bought it  The service engine light came on repeatedly the first couple of months and then we found out the light itself had gone bad  I recently had the check coolant light come on from time to time  but that stopped once I had the radiator serviced Overall  it is a great car for someone who doesn t have a lot of money to spend on a car  but wants something sort of nice that handles well Oh  and the title of this review is  quot Hillary quot  because I have a  quot Hillary for Senate quot  bumpersticker on my Escort  and it seems to be its new name br br
