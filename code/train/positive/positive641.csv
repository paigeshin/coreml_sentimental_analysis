 My family recently purchased a 2000 Ford F250 4 door  4x4  with the triton V 8 engine  I am extremely satisfied with this truck  The interior is very comfortable  and there is a lot of room  Many vehicles made today are based on economy  and are therefore made small  Not this truck  This truck is based on the old saying  quot Bigger is better quot  Even though the extra sizes makes it not that good on gas mileage  the comfort and style of it well makes up for that  It s towing  hauling  and plowing power is amazing  Some trucks are made for work  some trucks are made to look and ride nice  this is a work truck that looks and rides nice  I ve put the truck through it s hurdles  I ve tested the acceleration  the brakes  and the shocks many  many times  After running this truck up and down fields  through mud pits  and through the woods  I have come to the conclusion that this truck will not only take everything I through at it  but it will through it right back at me br br
