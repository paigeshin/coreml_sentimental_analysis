 My husband has always wanted a new truck and last year we went searching for a new vehicle  We waited until the end of the year clearance time and we found it  We got in on a Ford red carpet lease at 3 4  interest  For real  This was a terrific deal and the saleswoman and entire staff were easy to deal with and it is very fast getting regular maintenance appointments with our local dealership We have the extended cab  flared sides 6cylinder and it gets excellent gas mileage  In fact  it does about the same as my little car and we can haul with this baby  We put a hitch on it and took it to the home improvement store with our trailer on the back and it rode so smoothly you would never know that you had a trailer in tow  We are used to towing behind a Suburban  so that is saying a lot  The only thing I would change is that I would have more room in the extended part for seating  but I know that is really not what the truck was designed for  Driving this vehicle is as smooth as driving a car  It handles terrific and the paint job just gleams in the sun after being actually almost two years old  We have had no problems with this truck and IF we don t buy it at the end of the lease we will jump into another one  No question in my mind about that This is not a large family vehicle for certain  You can easily allow two children to safely ride in the jump seats  but they would have to be small children and I would not suggest a long trip because they would not be comfortable  But anyone who wants a truck for the smaller hauling jobs  or trailer towing  this is perfect  This is also great to go shopping with  put your large purchases easily in the body of the truck and you still have plenty of room for your groceries behind the seat  I do it all the time br br
