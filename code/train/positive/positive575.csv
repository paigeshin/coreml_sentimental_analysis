 I really enjoy my little red 1997 Ford Escort  The size seems just about perfect for easy handling  for one thing  Also  the heater works very well to warm the car up fairly quickly on a cold day  faster than my mother s Taurus  My aunt actually picked this car out for me as it was a moderately priced used vehicle  bought May 98 for  10 000  The only things I don t like about it are minor  I don t like the cup holders  anything larger than a  small  can tips over when you turn sharply  also  the gear shift will smash larger cups when you put the car in park  The horn also seems to require a lot of pressure to get it to honk  It has a nice rear window defrost  I also enjoy the remote control trunk and the foldable back seats  Driving is very pleasant  the car is comfortable and responds well  The model I own is a 4 door  perfect for my family of 4  Anyone who likes a maneuverable  comfortable small car should buy it  I suppose those with large families or hauling needs shouldn t
