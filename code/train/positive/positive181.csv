 I bought my 94 T Bird back in 1995 it had 22 000 miles on it  The reason we bought the car was I like the looks and the way the car performed and my wife loves the interior and the power the car has when she sticks her foot into the V8 engine  I also love the car for it s ride and it s handling it has a tight turning ratio for a car of it s size and the speed sensitive steering feels great also  I also like the fuel mileage I get 23 mpg and on a 300 mile trip the car got 29 mpg and for a car that size with a 205 hp V8 I was very happy  About the only thing I don t like about the car is that it s not very good in the snow but with the right tire s it s not to bad  The car now has 82 000 miles on it and it still looks and drives like new I always keep the oil and filters changed and being an auto detailer I keep the car polish and waxed  For who should buy it  Someone that likes a car that is comfy and the performance of a smooth V8 engine and handling to match  Who not to buy  People that hate to drive in the snow
