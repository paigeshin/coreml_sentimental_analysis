 I ve had my 1991 Ford Mustang LX for 3 years now  I had just come off a bad relationship with an 86 Cadillac and found this rather sorry looking Mustang for sale by a private owner  I picked it up with hopes of exchanging it within a year for something better  but it seems to be getting better with age  I did an awful lot of cosmetic work on the car because it s previous owner did not care for it properly  Now it is not only looking almost like new with it s original paint  but well accessorized as well  I ve added many performance products to this 2 3L car and have gotten the response of a V6  while maintaining the exceptional gas mileage  She spins tires in third gear  which  for the engine type  is impressive  It gets me to work and back  it s quick off the line  it looks great  and I ve had many offers  It s over the 110 000 mile mark and NO LEAKS  It has visited the shop about 3 times for regular maintenance  radiator  clutch cable  differential gasket  Other than that  I ve done all the tune ups and oil changes  Runs like a dream  smooth  quick  and just plain exiting  Unfortunately  you see too many of these cars on the road looking like they haven t seen a rag or sponge in years the better you take care of it  the better it will take care of you
