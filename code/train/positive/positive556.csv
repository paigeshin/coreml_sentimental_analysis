 I have owned a  91 Explorer Sport for nine years  My driving skills are very aggressive  especially off road  This has placed me in several awkward and embarrassing moments due to my driving  The Explorer came through everytime  and I don t even have all wheel drive capability  Parts can be expensive and hard to find  but there worth it  I have never once broke down or have experienced a component failure  I do recommend upgrading stock tires to more aggressive tread and a K amp N Filtercharger for increased performance  Explorers do need constant care and attention  If this is done  you too may own a vehicle and still love it after 10 years
