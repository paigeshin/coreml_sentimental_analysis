 My wife and I bought a 2000 F250 crewcab a little over a week ago  Everything we wanted was not on the vehicle  but it was a good compromise  Our intended uses for this truck include hauling our cattle to market  farm chores  and occasionally hauling the family around two adults three teenagers and one younger  We sat the kids in an extended cab to check legroom and found that size coming up short  When I drive  I don t care for kids knees in my back  Once we had decided on the vehicle size that fit us  we realized only Ford made a well equipped truck that large  We looked at the Ford commercial pamphlet and decided for long life the 6 8 liter V10 and heavy duty automatic transmission would be able to perform the tasks we were buying the truck for  It is a stout engine  and has torque that becomes available at a lower r p m  than the Chevy 6000 V8  Driving home and subsequently  I have found the Ford to be quiet  with a high quality ride more at home on a car than a truck  We have driven bumpy roads to test the ride quality as well as the ability of the cd player to withstand bumps without skipping  and it passed  The power trailer mirrors are great and the amount of glass in the body lets you see forever almost  The gas mileage is about normal for a truck  perhaps slightly better than I had thought for a large engine I enjoy driving this truck  it is comfortable and not bouncy  I put a half ton of feed in the back and didn t notice any difference  I would have liked the captains chairs and a different color  but I am happy with the purchase and it looks like it will last for years
