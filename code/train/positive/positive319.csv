 When we bought this van we had an Aerostar for almost 5 years and loved it  It was very reliable and lots of fun to drive  It was also one of the safest vehicles on the road at the time Last year  99  we bought the new model Windstar  It was like a dream car  it is so pretty and rides really well  It sits all five of us comfortable and if there are a couple extra people with us they are fine also My father in law mentioned it rides like a caddy and it does  Handles well and everything The gas mileage is good and it has taken very little to maintain it It has the highest safety ratings of all cars and this was a huge selling point for us  comfortable and safe  Both my husband and I were in an awful accident in Italy and don t want to take any chances again  Well  now what I don t like is this  A  It has an engine knock that has been checked over and the dealer said that there isn t a knock  It must be the cheap gas  well we upgraded to a name brand and the knock is worse We also have been having problems with the transmission slipping  again we were told they couldn t duplicate the problem  This isn t as bad as it was but is still there  The engine knock is bad from time to time  was so bad the other day that it was hard to accelerate We are leasing and in 2 years our lease will be up and we will have to decide whether to buy this van or go on to another vehicle  If the problems are not fixed  you know where we are going  To another dealer br br
