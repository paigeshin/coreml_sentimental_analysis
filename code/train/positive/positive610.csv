 The 1998 Escort ZX2 was my first car purchase  I shopped around all of summer 1998 and bought the Escort in August  I bought it for three reasons  price  looks  and handling  Price  I bought it for  9998  with pretty much no features  radio  rear window defroster  I ve been following the used car market  and I ve noticed it s kept its value exceptionally well Looks  I bought the denim blue model  I really love the sleek lines  and low slung look of this car  Handling  This car drives like a dream  It accelerates quickly  hugs corners  and has lots of zip for a four cylinder engine If you are taller  I m 5 4 quot  you probably will feel cramped in this car  It is a perfect fit for me  I don t have to scoot the seat forward much to reach the pedals  which I do for most other vehicles  The fully loaded ZX2 came with some pretty neat stuff  like CD  ABS  moon roof  air conditioning  power door locks windows and remote keyless entry  I couldn t afford those extras  but it s nice to know I could have had them  The one noticeable lack was the absence of cruise control  For long trips the seats are comfy  the stereo is decent  but no cruise control is a drag  I highly recommend this car for commuters or for mostly in town driving  For long trips though  the gas mileage is great  It has quite a bit of trunk space for a coupe  and the back seats are pretty spacious
