 My husband bought me a Ford Explorer Sport for Christmas last year  and told me that it was going to be our family I was so excited to have a Ford Explorer Sport  The prices do very depending on the options you get I have seen prices as low as 17 000 00 and as high as 25 000 00 Our SUV was priced at 21 500 00  I was disappointed because it seems like we got nothing for it Our SUV is pretty simple All it has is power windows and power door locks I really wish it came with an alarm  What I have discovered over the year is that it is a good car to have Its very dependable on and off road I was staying with my parents and where they live theres a lot of dirt roads This SUV can handle sand  clay  and rocks  I usually would drive about sixty on these dirt roads and it drove great It rides bumpy on the dirt roads and very smooth on the paved streets  Off road lovers will love this car  The SUV is pretty roomy It would be ideal for a family with child that don t have to ride in a car seat As I found out it is difficult to install a infant carrier and remove it as needed  For that reason I wish I had A Ford Explorer Besides that its really roomy  As for gas mileage mine gets roughly 288 to 295 miles per tank A tank holds roughly 17 gallons  I feel that s a lot of gas for those mileage  I do suggest that couples with babies consider the Explorer 4 door instead of the 2 door sport For couples with no children and children that don t need car seats would be a good buy
