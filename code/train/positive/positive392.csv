 Our lives were in the early stages of a complete overhaul  Well  not entirely  We were driving an old Corolla with nearly 200 000 miles on it and were becoming cramped  My wife was in the end stages of her first pregnancy and we wanted a minivan Truthfully  I hadn t even considered a Ford  no pun intended  I was focusing primarily on the Mercury Villagers  We wanted something with power  reliability  comfort  and a good look  Quite frankly  the Aerostar was not my first choice Aerostar s have a tendency to rust  I certainly don t want to drive a rust bucket  They seemed a bit bulky and their style never really changed in all the years of their manufacturing  It just wasn t the van I was looking for However  some friends of my parents were selling their 1994 Ford Aerostar Extended van  I just happened to be visiting my parents in Detroit and thought it might be fun to check out an Aerostar  I have to say that I was impressed  The van was a two tone maroon and tan  It had fiberglass running boards giving it a sort of solid   quot cruising quot  appeal  This Aerostar was clean and elegant The interior was customized boasting of quad captains chairs  plush carpeting  color TV  and oak trim throughout  The extended rear left plenty of room for strollers  pack n  play s  and luggage  Passengers found themselves in a comfortable situation without feeling cramped or inhibited I fired up the 4 0 liter V6 engine only to find it quiet and smooth  The van rolled down the road with ease and the acceleration left nothing to be desired  Handling was impressively good considering its size and shape  The odometer read only 68 000 miles  Needless to say  I bought it I have been very pleased with this van  Not long after I purchased it we packed it with seven people  an over abundance of luggage  and drove to Pittsburgh  There was plenty of room and the engine bolted up and down those steep Pennsylvania hills like a champ  My only criticism is the cost of repair  Though it is not scheduled for a tune up until about 100 000 miles it will cost me approximately  400 because of the compact engine compartment  I did have the drive belt replaced recently and it only cost me  36  I suppose  like most cars  the various repairs will balance out  This is a good vehicle and one that deserves consideration  I would buy another br br
