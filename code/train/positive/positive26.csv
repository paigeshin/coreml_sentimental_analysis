 INTRO Trucks  you either love them or you hate them  Me  I love them  Trucks in England are extremely rare  if you did own one it would be almost impossible to afford to run one  I wanted a truck so bad  When i moved to Oklahoma  i could not believe the amount of people who owned trucks  The one way for me to fit in  For me to become Americanized would be to buy a truck  And i love the F 150 FROM DEALERSHIP TO DEALERSHIP With so many dealerships and so many different types of trucks out there  my wife and i set out early  I knew i wanted a ford  I m a ford man  Always have been always will be  you always know what you are going to get with fords  Reliable  dependable transportation at reasonable prices  I started out looking at used trucks  i found a 2000 XL model for  10 000 and was really tempted to buy it  but i wanted to look around at one more dealership  So we went to Hudiburg  There was a beautiful red pickup right by the entrance to the show room  The salesman told me it was a 2003  i told him i could not afford it  and then he told me the price   12 988  After i picked my jaw up off the floor and put my eyes back in their sockets i was ready to take the beast for a test drive  He told me that it was the special Oklahoma Texas Package that made it so cheap  It is just a basic F 150 XL but oh boy do i love it FIRST IMPRESSIONS If you have read any of my other reviews on automobiles you will know that i am quite particular on what i like  I like my vehicles to be curvy  I have no idea why  This was a big deciding factor in what truck i wanted to buy  The F 150 looks beautiful  Sleek curves and lots of chrome and a re designed grill for 2003  The XL comes with chrome wheels as standard and they look pretty sharp  The F 150 is very easy on the eye a pure joy to look at The Interior of the truck is basic but everything you need is there  The XL is the low end model of the F 150 so there are no extras  what you see is what you get  The dashboard is once again like the exterior very curvy and real appealing it is nice to look at and is not harsh on the eyes  The layout is simple and looks clean and tidy  On the XL there is no rev counter  just the Speedo  oil gauge temperature gauge and fuel gauge  The mileage counter is digital  which is pretty standard nowadays in most vehicles  The dials are big and are very easy to read and in classic ford style they light up green at night The stereo and the a c and heat controls are within good reach of the driver and they are very easy to operate though i think the stereo could be better  i also wish that ford would stop fitting double din stereos in their vehicles  That just adds extra cost when you want to replace the stereo  which i have just done  The A C and the heater work very very well  It gets cool very quickly in the truck  which is what you really need here in Oklahoma  and the truck gets nice and warm quickly too My truck comes with a bench seat  which is actually pretty comfortable  and gives a reasonable amount of support  It folds forward so you can put a few small items behind the seat  I have a complaint about the material used on the seats though  It really isn 146t very good  I would have thought that being a truck the fabric would have been a bit tougher but it is not  About 2 months after buying the truck the stitching begun undoing and holes started appearing  and that is just through normal use  so i have now brought seat covers to stop further damage to the fabric  The steering column is not adjustable and the bench seat only moves back and forward and the back really doesn t move very much so you are always sitting in an upright position ON THE OPEN ROAD The F 150 i have is the 4 2 v6  with standard transmission  The engine puts out 202BHP and is plenty powerful for everyday use  Correct me if i am wrong but i think the 4 2 V6 is only 20 BHP Less than the 4 6 V8  The Truck is quick  not lightning quick but there is ample power there  Over taking on the interstate is not a problem  nor is having little fun at the lights   The truck does about 19 MPG on the interstate and about 17 MPG around town  which is pretty good  It costs me about  25 00 to fill the tank from scratch  The Interior Noise is pretty high  but compared to earlier model F 150 s it has improved greatly  The truck handles pretty well and it comes with power steering as standard  which always makes life easier  Another thing that really surprises me with the truck is that there is very little roll when you turn into corners  More so than if you were in a car but still impressive  The ride quality is very good  You get the usual bouncy ride that you get from most trucks but overall the ride comfort is very good  My only other niggle is that the truck is rear wheel drive  I understand why that is but when there is nothing in the bed of the truck the back wheels tend to spin very easily so you have to take great car when driving this vehicle  the wheels spin if there is loose gravel on the road and it can be pretty bad when it has rained  so you just have to be that extra bit careful There is plenty of room in the bed of the truck for whatever you want to put in there and man does having a truck come in handy  We just moved into our first house and i do not know what we would have done without the truck  you can fit tons of things into the bed  it comes in very handy Overall this truck is great  I love it  For  12 988 i cannot complain to much  it is a basic model truck that will do you proud and will probably last you a life time
