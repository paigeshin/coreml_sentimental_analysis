 We are on our 4th Taurus  The 93 Sable 3 8l met it s fate during a winter storm and a tree  Wife walked away with a sore shoulder  We had 98k and no problems  I had a 92 Wagon with 182k and traded it in when I found the Mustang I wanted  My wife is on her 2nd  Gen3  The 98 DOHC is by far the best car we have ever owned  Plenty of power  great mpg  and enough room for our family of 4  With family 4 8 hours away and 2 small kids  road trip comfort is VERY important  The 2k model is by far the best refined edition of this car  The same basic chassis since its 1986 introduction  it is even used as the base for the Windstar  If we can afford it when we go for our next car  we will probably upgrade to the  Star br br
