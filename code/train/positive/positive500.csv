 The Ford Ranger is sharp looking truck and provides a comfortable ride  I t has been great for getting back and forth to work and has been very reliable  However if you want to pass someone the four cylinder engine does not provide enough power to do it without downshifting  and I would always hesitate before trying to pass on an up hill slope  Overall the paint seems to be holding up very well as are the factory alloy wheels  Braking and handling provide no major complaints If you are looking to do heavy hauling this is not recommended though it should do fine with the 6 cylinder version  This is going to be a wonderful starter vehicle for my son when he turn sixteen next year
