 To begin  I should say that this car was not my first choice  My heart was set on a new Honda Civic  I had test driven the new 2 door coupe and had fallen in love  and after the problems I had experienced with my  94 Jetta  the review is at  a href auto review 6ED0 CE1F0E5 3A1D7F4C prod4 tk CB008 1 13 http www epinions com auto review 6ED0 CE1F0E5 3A1D7F4C prod4 tk CB008 1 13 a  if you re interested  I wanted a car with a reputation for reliability  Not only that  from witnessing problems other family members had been faced with with their own Ford vehicles  I had decided that Ford wasn t even worth considering  Finally after dealership after dealership refusing to give me what I needed for my Jetta in a trade in  I was still financed up to my neck  I ended up test driving a Ford Focus  only half seriously  But not only did they offer me what I needed for my trade in  they also had a program where they will add up to  4000 onto the purchase price of the vehicle  and give it to you in a cheque so that you can go on a trip or pay credit cards or whatever you feel like doing with it  Seeing as the Jetta ran up my credit cards significantly  and this was the perfect opportunity to unload the thing  I jumped on it  and managed to bargain them down to close to invoice price  I ve only owned it since mid May  but so far no regrets My Focus is a Fort Knox Gold SE  with the standard 110hp 2 0 litre SPI engine and manual transmission  It has loads of standard equipment  such as A C  CD player  and remote keyless entry   everything my Jetta had and more  The one I bought had the  Comfort Group  which included map lights  tilt telescopic steering wheel  and cruise control  I don t think I would have bothered with this package had I ordered the car from the factory  but I love the tilt telescopic wheel  Unfortunately the cruise control hasn t worked from the beginning  and I ve been waiting 3 weeks now for parts  Very annoying  because though this is not a life or death option  I have to wonder if all parts take this long to come in Now though I haven t owned this car very long  I ve put almost 5000kms on it already  so now that it s reasonably well broken in  I feel I can write a decent opinion about it I ll start with the transmission  Before I bought this car I had never driven a manual tranny  so I can t really compare it to anything  I do know that it took me no time to figure it out and I can get some beautifully smooth shifts out of it  Far smoother than the Jetta s clunky automatic tranny  I let my parents drive it from time to time if I don t need it  and they both could go on for hours about how nicely this car shifts and how positive it is  The one thing that I could have really used while learning to drive it is a tachometer  I have no idea if I am over revving the thing and it s a bit unnerving  The  shift up  indicator is a joke  It comes on at the stupidest times and if you follow it the car lurches and lugs constantly  I try to ignore it and go roughly by what the owners manual says  but even then it seems like it s too soon  I have found it goes best if I shift at 10 15kph higher than what the manual says  and I still get over 500kms on a tank of gas  so not too shabby  The Jetta had a bigger gas tank and I was lucky to get 400kms out of it  I m still getting used to stop and go traffic so as I get better at that I suspect I ll get even better mileage in the city  however I am doing much less highway driving than I was a month ago  it accounted for about 20  of my kilometres  now maybe 5  at best  so I doubt I ll see much of a difference in my gas mileage Now to the engine performance handling  This thing is loud  Good for knowing when to shift  but takes away from the initial refined feel of the car  Fortunately there is a really cool feature on the stereo that pumps the volume up to compensate for the engine noise  The car has pretty good pick up as far as I am concerned  but keep in mind that before the Jetta I drove a 3 cylindar Subaru Justy for 7 years so I m used to sluggish cars  I think this car would keep up with my old Jetta  but not on hills  Especially mountain highways  It s rather pathetic  even if you shift down  Since I don t have a tachometer I am not comfortable experimenting with shifting down again  so I live with it  On the flat road the car handles 140kph quite nicely  Even though it is a relatively tall car  it seems to hug the road and handles curves beautifully  And that stereo just keeps pumping out exceptional sound The interior is wonderful  So smooth and sleek  feels way richer than it really is  Just don t look too closely  Some seams are uneven  and parts like the air vents feel like you could just pull them right out with little effort   my friends and I are thinking of betting on how long it will take before the window handles break off  But then when it comes to this stuff I am rather picky  Where the shift console meets the carpet really bothers me  It looks like someone just cut the plastic quickly with scissors  As far as roominess goes  I am very pleased  The bucket seats are slightly hollowed in the back so that knees don t press into the front passengers  backs so to offer extra leg room  there s lots of head room   even my 6 2  boss had room to spare   and you don t feel like you re going to bash elbows with the person beside you  I don t know that I d try to fit 3 people in the back  but with the middle seat having a shoulder belt I would feel safe doing it  It already has a couple rattles  which are annoying  but not unbearable  though it is disappointing that they have started this early in the car s life Trunk space is huge  And if someone manages to get locked in the trunk  there s a glow in the dark handle which can be pulled to open it from the inside  So far none of my friends have volunteered to try this little feature out  the chickens  To make the back seats lie flat you have to pull knobs in the trunk  Not sure if I like that or not  I guess it s nice that anything in the trunk is secure  I m just used to doing it from inside the car I have to say I am very happy I bought this car so far  It has far exceded my expectations for Ford cars  It has also been a good replacement for the Jetta as it has most of the features the Jetta did  plus a few extra  I would recommend this car to anyone as disgusted with VW as I am  young people just out of college  or young families  If you re a speed demon  you ll probably want to upgrade to the Zetec engine  It s not expensive  and it gives you 130hp which is 20hp more than the SPI  My only regret is that I didn t upgrade to that engine
