 I have been driving my 1994 Mustang GT Convertible V8 5 0 for about 8 months  It is a beautiful car and a pleasure to drive with it s power and great handling  It is as fun to drive as it is attractive  It s a car that you can drive and actually enjoy yourself  Ample room for four but small enough to fit in those all too prevalent compact car parking spaces Now for the downside  in these 8 months of joyous driving  I have been hit 6 times  Once I was sideswiped  twice I was rear ended at traffic lights and three times I was hit while parked or stopped in a parking lot Maybe I have bad CARma  But I really feel that a bright red convertible draws more cars to collide with them  It acts as a magnet to other cars bumpers Another problem the car has is that in many 93 95 Fords  the transmission has been known to slip an operation which costs about two thousand dollars to repair and I am currently undergoing the operation for the third time  this time under warranty  thank heavens So the transmission slips  and cars seem to flail wildly about when they are near this one but who cares  It is a beautiful car  made to run on 87 octane  which saves money and now is very inexpensive to buy  Buy one  keep it for two years  and then sell it  just so you can have the experience of driving this fine piece of magnetic metal br br
