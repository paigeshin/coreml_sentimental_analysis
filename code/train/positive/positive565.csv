 I have loved mustangs since I was old enough to drive  I finally got one  It was well worth the wait  I have had more fun with this car than any other I ve driven  I bought the car used because I was just not quite ready for a brand new car  Besides  Mustangs always hold their worth  She is small enough that I can move in and out of traffic with ease  yet I am very comfortable when driving  The only downside is the small back seat  Or at least it is a downside to my daughter who has the very long legs  The back seat does not bother me at all in the driver seat  This is a sports car and not a family vehicle  The car will really run too  Not that I am a speed demon or anything  Anyone who wants to have fun driving should get one  If you are a young family with small children  you may want to wait until all the kids are driving themselves  But eventually everyone should experience the fun of a mustang  There is only one thing that I would change about my car  That is the placement of the drink cup holder  It sits directly behind my stick shift and sometimes a drink will get in my way  It needs to be back about 3 inches  Other than that  I have the perfect car
