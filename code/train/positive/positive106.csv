 Let me first preface my thoughts by assuring you that I do not work for any car manufacturer  After considering the Acura MDX  Chevy Tahoe and Toyota Sequoia  I went with the 2003 Eddie Bauer 4x2 5 4L Expedition  I must admit that I have been reticent about American cars in recent years and at first was leaning toward the MDX  My primary fear was quality  However  after extensive research and a test drive of all four  I think Ford has the best product for the price Ford really did a good job with the new Expedition  It looks like Ford actually listened to the feedback from the previous Expedition drivers  strange concept  and then built the new Expedition  Examples of what I am talking about 1  Design  The interior design  while still American at heart  is clearly not the same old Ford  For example  Ford seems to have a habit of slapping together a confusing array of tiny plastic buttons and lights and then calling it a dash  Did Ford actually think that people like to have a readout that looks like one of those blinking light panels that Spock always used to stare at  The new dash really looks somewhat like the new Audi  See the air conditioning vents and two tone black and tan dash  I just wish they had gone all the way with this concept  There are still some of the old Ford here with tiny buttons and green led lights  I d prefer 100  analog except where absolutely necessary  2  No More Noisy Wishy Washy Ride  The frame is stiffer  Outside noise seems to be less  There is also rear independent suspension  The ride is really nice and the steering is apparently much improved 3  Convenience  The third and second row seats fold down completely flat  Storage is everywhere  The Eddie Bauer edition even has buttons to lower the third row from the back  No need to haul in and out huge unwieldy third row seats  Seat memory  In dash 6 CD  Pop down mini wide angle rear view mirror to keep an eye on activity in the aft section  DVD for the kids  Second row middle seat slides forward  This is great if you ve got a kid in a child s seat back there 4  Quality  I know that I just bought the thing  But the fact of the matter is that the Expedition just seems to be built to last  No jiggles on the highway and a general sense of solidity 5  Price  Maybe I just had a better negotiating experience with my dealer  but the price I got it below invoice bringing the 41 000 sticker down to 33 000  When compared to the competition  this was hands down the best option On the downside  while apparently more efficient than previous models  the Expedition still likes to consume gasoline  Also  while most of the upgrades seem quality  a few seem like less than first rate  To give you an idea what I am talking about and I concede this is nit picky  the sunglass holder kind of jumps down at you when you push the button  In my 1997 Pathfinder  when you hit the sunglass holder button  it gracefully slides open  The leather also seems to be a little lower grade than some of the top of the line SUV s  e g  Acura
