 Bottom Line  I have had my Escape for six months and love it The Great  A lot of car for the price  roomy interior  decent gas mileage  people crane their necks on the road to check it out The Not So Great  Lots of wind noise on the highway  probably not ideal for true off roading may cause accidents from other drivers admiring it I first purchased my Ford Escape last October when I was staring straight into the beginning of another harsh winter and a daily  two hour round trip commute  I needed a vehicle with four wheel drive and did not want to have to resort to selling off body parts to pay for gas  Here s some specifics The look  I purchased a light parchment gold Escape with the leather interior  The truck looks great inside and out  People are always admiring it  asking about it  and I definitely recommend going with leather if you can afford it  It is comfortable  sharp  and will help hold up the resale value The ride  The car rides very smoothly  However  when you jump on the highway  be prepared to turn the radio up and or talk very loudly with your passengers  The wind noise is pretty bad  This is about the only negative thing I have to say about the car  Bells and Whistles  While I have a more Spartan model  you can  trick out  your Escape with moonroof and deluxe sound system  including a six CD changer  I have the standard  single CD system and am very happy with it  Shifting into four wheel drive is a snap  and the cruise and wiper controls are of the standard  simple to use variety  The gear shifter is somewhat awkwardly placed and gets in the way of the radio  I have the V6 model and the fuel economy is decent while still providing plenty of giddyup  You can also get a four cylinder model for increased fuel efficiency  but I have my doubts as to whether that will lend enough power to adequately drive the car For serious off roaders  this probably is not your best option  The Escape rides lower than larger SUV s and I wouldn t trust it in a true off roading situation
