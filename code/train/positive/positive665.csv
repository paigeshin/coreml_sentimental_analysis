 Ok so maybe Econoline Vans aren t for everyone  especially if you live in the city  If you aren t someone that lives in the city and you like to drive long distances on vacations then this vehicle is for you What s The Interior Of The Econoline Like Well one way to explain this question is by comparing the interior of an econoline to that of an airplane that is first class  The seats are very comfortable  and my particular model is equipped with gadgets galore  A plug in vacuum  a TV and VCP  a mechanical bed that turns into a back seat  a 10 disc CD Changer  and much more  With power AC a ride to my grandparents house in Florida is very comfortable What s The Mile Per Gallon On The Econoline Although I am very seldom a driver of my econoline since my parents do most of the driving I do know that the Econoline gets better miles to the gallon then that of a Jeep Grand Cherokee  Note  This may not be accurate for all types of Cherokees  The only reason I say this fact is because I recall my mother and my uncle comparing gas mileage prices  And the econoline was better then the jeep How Is The Handling Of An Econoline Although I very seldom use the econoline for my personal driving the few times I ve used it I noticed that it is a difficult vehicle to manuever in tight situations  This is due to the size of the vehicle rather then the steering  The steering is very good  the only difficulty with the handling is getting used to the size of the vehicle Why Should Someone Buy One These Like I said earlier the Econoline is not for everyone  If you are however one who likes the travel  then this is the perfect car for your needs  With good miles to the gallon  and an extremely good ride  it is well worth the money br br
