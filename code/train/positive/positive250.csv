 I just turned over 30 000 miles on my 1998 Ford Ranger  four door XLT  4x4  This is my third over the past fourteen years  This is the first that ever had a glitch  The  door ajar  light stays light and occasionally the dome light stays on by itself  The dome light is always on for the first few tire revolutions  I haven t counted the actual number but about twenty feet worth The rear transaxel  clanks  once for each of the first two gears when accelerating from a stop Of course the original tires were Firestone Recall brand  I was lucky enough to have my blow out just before the story hit the media  I paid six hundred plus for a set of Big O tires at less than twenty thousand miles  At this time there is no known recourse for people like me who only got hurt in the wallet when their Firestone s fell apart For the most part I love my truck  It s got personality and a past   Like most of my friends br br
