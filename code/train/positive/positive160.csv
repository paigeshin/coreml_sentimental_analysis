 We 146ve had our 98 Windstar since it was new and give it an overall excellent to superb rating  PROS  The Windstar is a decent sized minivan  There is enough cargo space behind the back seat to load a couple hundred dollars worth of groceries  Other minivans I looked at such as the Dodge Plymouth Caravan  Japanese models  and the Chevy Astro were lacking in this area The Windstar is a nice riding vehicle with great driveability  The seats are very comfortable for long trips and the dash is laid out perfectly  This van is probably heavier than it 146s counterparts  which will affect gas mileage and performance  but it 146s worth it for it 146s 5 star safety rating  This vehicle feels very  very solid Weather sealing is superb  Road noise is not bad at all  The brakes have performed flawlessly and still do not require replacement at the 60K mile mark The engine and transmission have performed flawlessly and are very smooth though shifts can be mushy at times  You 146re better off turning off the over drive in town or the transmission may  147hunt 148 for the right gear  I like how Ford put the over drive button on the gearshift making this very simple and easy CONS  The door ajar sensing switches are prone to failure causing the light and audible alarm to continue to annoy you until you exceed 15 MPH  This is very frustrating  It will usually quit within the first mile or two but Ford needs to find a permanent fix for this problem  This same problem existed in the Aerostar  You 146d think they could find a better system  UPDATE  I found that if you spray WD 40 or a similar light oil in the door latch this problem may go away  Dirt seems to be the culprit since the door ajar switches part of the door latch  This area obviously isn t sealed The driver side and passenger side front doors are too large  This is great when you need them but when you park on an upward incline they tend to slam shut at the most inopportune times  I E  on your legs or back when leaning in the vehicle  Even worse your kids  This is the only safety factor with this vehicle  For some reason each of the four Ford cars and vans I have owned have had problems with excessive battery corrosion  The batteries usually last two years at the most  My GMC pick up has seven years on a four year battery and is still starting fine RECOMMENDATIONS  If you want a 98 Windstar look for the following options and or problems 1  Get rear air conditioning even if you live in a cool climate  It 146ll add to the resale value and the additional air ducting will help with heating for the rear passengers in the winter 2  Opt for the large engine  The 3 0 is what I have and it 146s very peppy but the 3 8 would provide nearly the same gas mileage with an increase of torque and horsepower  3  Check the front suspension for loose or damaged components  I had a bolt loosen itself on the front stabilizing bar in the passenger side wheel well  It made rattling noises whenever a bump was hit  I torqued it down and have had no problems since 4  Test drive the vehicle to see if it has the faulty door ajar sensors Other than the things mentioned this vehicle has been very reliable and a pleasure to drive  Other brands of minivans also have their quirks and problems too which you 146ll find if you look at reviews for those  I feel the Windstar is a very safe and reliable vehicle for the entire family and a good value UPDATE  As of March 2003 the Windstar is still a reliable vehicle  Some problems noted since writing my initial review are   Drivers side window quit working and sliding door lock quit working  These items should not have failed with 70 000 miles on the vehicle  Resale value has also dropped faster than I anticipated  I would still recommend this vehicle though even with these flaws
