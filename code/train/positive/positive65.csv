 If you re looking for a reliable and safe family sedan  then look no further than the Taurus  I ve had mine for nearly eight years and it still performs like the day I drove it off the dealer s lot  The car handles extremely well and has plenty of passenger and storage space to accommodate a family of four  The gas mileage is adequate  I d prefer it to be higher  but the ride is comfortable and the design is appealing to the eye  Price wise  there are few cars that can offer you what the Taurus does at its price  Overall  I have been extremely satisfied with my purchase and expect to keep this car for at least another 5 years br br
