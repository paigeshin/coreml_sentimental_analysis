 I recently purchased a new 2000 Ford F150 XLT Super Cab 4X4 7700 pound package  I owned a 1999 F150 XLT Super Cab 4X4 right before this purchase  There were many reasons why I traded the 1999 in on this 2000  One of the biggest reasons for the trade was the 1999 never felt like a  quot real quot  truck  It rode more like a car and actually handled like one too  The other BIG reason for the trade was the 1999 IS NOT rated for a snowplow  I have never owned a truck that you could not put a plow on  I live in a very snowy area and a plow is a must  With the new 2000 I had a 7 1 2 foot regular duty Fisher Plow attached  The truck RIDES like a truck  it HANDLES like a truck and it WORKS like a truck should  The best thing about the Ford F150 7700 is I can still register it with my State of residence as a 1 2 ton truck  This saves me money and the trouble that goes along with having  quot commercial quot  plates on my private vehicle  So while I have the payload of a 3 4 ton vehicle I still have regular plates  While all this is great the truck still has an awesome appearance  best value for the money  most truck for the money  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody that has heavy towing or hauling to do  Anybody that needs a plow or anybody that remembers the way the old trucks felt when you drove them  I would not recommend this to anybody that is concerned about fuel economy or anyone that likes a nice cushiony ride  This truck is a REAL truck and there are no manf out there today to compete with the Ford s 7700  package  Do yourself a favor and check one out
