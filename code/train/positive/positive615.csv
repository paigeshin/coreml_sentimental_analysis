 This is my first new car and I was interested in getting the best car for the cheapest price  and that is what I got with the Ford Escort  The price was great  and I even got extras  Automatic door lock  air conditioning  automatic transmission  were all included  The only problem with the climate control is the heat does not get REALLY hot and it does take a long time to heat up  this occurs only in the severe cold  The air conditioner works immediately and gets REALLY cold  The only other  quot problem quot  or disadvantage with this car is the pick up  I do not notice any problem until I am merging into heavy traffic and have to make a quick entrance onto the roadway it just doesn t happen  The engine revs  but I find myself pushing myself back and forth  in a futile attempt to get the car to perform faster  Other than those 2 minor disadvantages  the car is wonderful  It is small enough to get in and out of places easily  yet does not compromise comfort   I suppose if you weighed over 200 lbs  there might be a problem  Very smooth ride  and easy to handle  The back seats are split and either one can come down  or both  and give more trunk room  I notice of all my cars and I have had many this one has the most useable trunk space never have problems with my groceries  Gas mileage is great  The only thing I have ever had done was oil changes and have had no mechanical problems  It is a great car  for a family of 4  2 kids and 2 adults fit with no  quot room quot  problems
