 Headline  Avid Honda owner trades for All American made rear wheel drive After 9 wonderful years of Honda Accord ownership  I ll save that story for another Epinion  I traded in my Champaign colored 1989 Accord LX for a 4 6 liter V 8 equipped 1997 Thunderbird in early 1998  Ah  the car of my dreams  there are many  since my friend Mark Potter bought a 1986 Thunderbird back in 1988 I only paid a couple thousand more for the one year old T Bird than my new Honda back in  89  what a great deal  And this has been a FUN and reliable car  I feel spoiled by all that power spinning the rear wheels  And the optional traction control really works  you try to scoot the back end out from under you but you can t unless you push that little white button hidden in the console to defeat the system  However  in the rain you better watch out  the back end tends to slip during relatively slow turns when the road is slick I like power  but not for power s sake  I like knowing that I m able to launch up a freeway onramp without the fear that I won t be up to speed while merging with that big rig doing 70 MPH  This car gives you all the merging confidence you need with power to spare While you receive many benefits from having such a large power plant under the hood you sacrifice gas mileage in a BIG way  If you drive conservatively you may be able to wring 21 MPG out of a T Bird  But if your heavy foot wins over reason much of the time be prepared to give up more cash at the Shell station for that privilege to the tune of 15 or 17 MPG   or even less if you REALLY like racing The fit and finish of most American cars have been in question since the  70s so I was pleased to find that this car was well put together  Body seams are straight and even  and interior members are held in place with relatively few rattles  There are body flex noises at times  but in a car with such rigid construction something has to give Rigid construction is a major player in handling  And this T Bird handles well while flying low and straight on the freeway  and gets only a moderate rating in tight corners  Why  For a car this size it should be much lighter  it tends to push the front end while cornering and doesn t reassure the driver the way many lighter  front wheel drive cars flatly tackle tight turns  However  for such a beefy ride it eeks out adequate performance The maintenance has been quite minimal with the first major tune up due at 100K  I m only at 45K  Changing and checking the fluids are quite easy with Ford s signature yellow color coding under the hood helping you find all the different fluid intakes to keep your V 8 running smoothly   This car loves maintenance and pays you back with smooth performance I ve considered trading in this car for an SUV  but I can t seem to part with it  Whenever I get back in the drivers seat and fire up that big engine I m glad I have the power  luxury  comfort and security of a large American car FEATURES 4 6 liter V 8 Traction control ABS Factory alarm Moon roof Leather wrapped steering wheel Alloy wheels Power antenna Power drivers seat
