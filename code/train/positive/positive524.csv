 When I signed a 2 yr lease for a new Explorer I had never had a SUV  I Can t believe I lived so long with out one  I have 22 000 miles on the Explorer and the my plan is to purchase it at lease end  My only warranty repair work has been the Firestone Tire recall and the rear window wiper motor stopped working  The AM FM receiver is great  I can get radio stations I never could in my other vehicles  However  the standard speaker system is pretty lame and the in dash single CD player will skip if you go over really rough roads The Air condition and Heater is great  This vehicle isn t equipped with the Rear Heater AC vents  but with our summer trips to Florida and Winter trips to Michigan the rear passengers were always comfortable  The front optional Captain chairs are very comfortable and roomy  However  the rear seating isn t all that great for adults  but children seem to be content with the rear seat comfort and they like the added feeling of being  up high  with the wider window visibility  And since the back windows are darkly tinted we don t have the sun bake effect Unlike other passenger cars  my young son has never felt car sick in this vehicle  The Cargo area with the fold down rear seats is great for hauling everything from Christmas trees to home remodeling supplies  The Gas mileage is only about 20 mpg at best  and the passing ability on 2 lane roads is poor  but I assume this is normal for V6 SUV s  hey  this is not a sports car Cup Holders   Awesome  The 2 in the front can hold the biggest drink out there  even a 1 liter water bottle  And the 2 in the back are a blessing with kids Snow Wish I could report but we ve had a couple of really mild winters here in the Midwest and I haven t had a chance to try her out  But she s great for going over curbs  Ford Explorer are everywhere  Here in the Midwest it would probably be very easy to find repair shops and parts to work on this vehicle when it s off warranty
