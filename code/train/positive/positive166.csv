  BULLETIN  Our Explorer was nudging 30 000 miles during a difficult month for us   a major service was needed but I was paralyzed with indecision about how the nearest FORD Dealer in Carson City NV would react  My preliminary inquiries about the car and possible warranty issues  Were simply brushed off with condescending comments   no offers to FIX things b  We were filled with misgivings for months  I did not trust them  Our laundry list had grown a bit  The front passenger seat belt was hanging up now  That was preceded by troubles with the Hazard Lights switch  the rear window wiper would not work  and a couple of minor irritants  Came the day of decision   I took the Car over the hill  Sierras  to Sacramento  CA where we had purchased our prize  The service consulant appeared  wrote up the 30 000 mile service  379  I added a  112  including labor  set of mud flaps  then he lent a very interested ear to my woes  He looked at all four items  wrote them down  I asked him to estimate the costs to me   I was willing to come all the way back  224 mile round trip  to accommodate their schedule  He blinked  then took the keys   And offered me a free rental car b  The best place to be while enduring dentistry and car repairs is elsewhere and I went there for several hours  I returned after several hours to find the  Explorer  still sitting in its stall  Of course  it was a  big  service and I had added the mud flaps at the last second  After another hour  came the call    542 24  OK   379 plus 112    491 plus Sales Tax    50 Deductible on Warranty  Seemed OK  What about the repairs estimate    Huh  Those items were fixed   on Warranty b  I fainted  It is incredible how much difference a Dealer can make   With the recent models of their  EXPLORER  SUV the Ford Motor Company appears to have beaten the Import Market at its own game  In fact  Ford  HAS BECOME  an import company  having absorbed such as Jaguar and Volvo recently  These acquisitions came with new  foreign  expertise  combined with the best of a century of manufacturing and merchandising in the USA  With these assets  Ford is producing new products that deliver what the buyer has become used to getting during the past 25 years  What did Ford do  Study the competition and note what the buyers like and try to do it better  Rather than torment buyers with agonizing decisions about options that should be standard items  Ford has created and delivers a standardized vehicle in three basic versions  any one of which can overcome buyer resistance with an ample complement of attractive and useful features that make sense and are easy to use  It should not be necessary to mention but high quality workmanship should be evident everywhere in the vehicle  It is   WHAT MADE US CONSIDER THIS VEHICLE b  From 1973 to 1999  we owned imports by BMW  Audi  VW and Toyota  in that order  They offered reasonable pricing  fuel economy  needed few options and were readily recognizable  They delivered performance and  at times  lots of satisfaction but a graph would show how we fared monetarily   outrageously costly maintenance says it all  Our son  cured of his addiction to Toyotas  purchased a Camry replacement last year   One of his best friends is an executive with FORD  It was a Ford EXPLORER  With TWO Wheel Drive And so  we were ready to be  converted  back  or domesticated   THE PURCHASE b  After two years of planning  we ventured into the car market  For budgeting reasons  the used car market was suitable for us and the search began  My wife wrote the specifications  Explicitly  what she wanted had to be WHITE  have FOUR doors  less than FIVE years old  have LOW mileage  a reasonable PRICE  and COMFORTable  My input was limited to avoiding 4 Wheel Drive Fully prepared  we went off on a joyride one Friday and found our dream car  No luck on color  otherwise they had a 1998 that met her criteria  Exceeded it  in fact  The mileage was only 16 400  Marilyn  currently the breadwinner of the family  did the road testing  It was a  GO  The light green car sold itself   OPERATING  The first impression when entering the EXPLORER is of the ample head room provided in the opening  as well as the roof ceiling height  No more contusions on my poor pate  Although the EXPLORER is a relatively complex vehicle  it is easy to drive  The engine power is ample  easily overcoming challenges from changes in terrain  Although the center of gravity is higher  the EXPLORER glides around curves   Being a car on a truck chassis  the ride becomes  jouncy  when passing over bumps and depressions in the pavement at slow speeds  This is a negligible nuisance i  The transmission gear changes are barely perceptible  The transitions to and from OVERDRIVE are detectable only on the Tachometer  The overdrive control is within reach of an extended finger on the gear selection stalk  Acceleration is startlingly effective  The SOHC V6 needs only the lightest touch on the pedal to take the EXPLORER from standing start to road speed  I estimate that adequate performance in traffic requires only about 1 4  of pedal  Why all that power  For towing a ton and a half trailer with full passenger complement   The EXPLORER is also available with a V8 engine  the operation of which must be pretty exciting i  The instruments and controls are clustered to allow the operator to run the machine without undue distraction from the road and traffic  Crucial instruments are larger  crucial controls  including windshield visibility  are within reach of an extended finger  One must reach for others  an effort that usually involves taking one s eyes off the road  Driver information from the instrument set is abundant  although some warning lights are so small that anxiety can replace knowledge  As in an aircraft cockpit  an operator should know the instrument layout so well that a  sweeping  scan is all that is needed to ascertain that operations are normal  Close scrutiny is advisable only when the vehicle is stopped  The same goes for the Steering Wheel  tilt  adjustment  Simply stated  DO NOT try to do this while the vehicle is in motion  Handling is rewarding and crisp  the EXPLORER has a very tight turning ratio  making it one of the most nimble vehicles we have driven  At road speeds  the steering is VERY sensitive  requiring very little input from the operator  This advantage has a price  One should maintain high levels of attention to the task at hand  Both hands  that is  Braking is steady and smooth  We have not tested the panic conditions for which the ABS system was designed  The parking brake WORKS  an easy push of the foot will set it  The controls for the  Cruise  control  labeled  Speed  for some reason  are located on the steering wheel  One should get to know the 5 buttons by touch  studying them on the road is foolishness  The system is very accurate  requiring only a touch to set and to disable   CAUTIONARY ADVISORY  Since it is a relatively high performance design  the EXPLORER is demanding on drivers  who must learn to concentrate on the task of running this finely tuned machine  All too often  drivers seem to become intoxicated with the SUV concept and design and allow the vehicle to govern them  An operator who is distracted by passengers  usecured items items in the seating areas  comfort and audio control settings and  of course  the infamous cell phones  is out of control and is a hazard to persons and property  A lack of attention can lead to an unpleasant emergency situation  Of course  the aggressive driver is a threat to all  A high performance vehicle like the EXPLORER is unforgiving of driver errors  which can account for some of the highly publicized rollovers   Tire air pressure is problematic  the recent spate of highly publicized accidents illustrate that  In the Ford EXPLORER operator s manual  the recommendation is to inflate per instructions molded onto the tire itself  35PSI on our present equipment  On the EXPLORER itself  a door sticker advises a conflicting pressure of only 26 PSI  This utterly silly and dangerous advice probably stemmed from some anxious sales executive who meant to  soften  the ride for some target buyer segment that dislike  hard  or bumpy rides   or trucks in general  The Explorer design came from the  Ranger  pickup chassis  Anyone with experience with radial tires going flat will recollect how sloppy the handling becomes  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TIRE YOU ARE INFLATING i   DISAPPOINTMENTS  We had some at first  exacerbated by an indifferent dealer in Nevada   15 miles North of here  Per the above  all disappointments were remedied by a crackerjack dealer   112 miles West of here   SATISFACTION  It is a complete success with us  We have had it for eight months now and expect to keep it for 6 5 years  So far  each day has brought a new and happy surprise for us   Ours is a 1998 2WD  two wheel drive    NOT a 2D  two door  Model  SPORT  which is otherwise similar but shorter   FEATURES  This is a high end model variation  commonly referred to as  Loaded  which package includes
