 Ford has made little or no buzz about the fact that the current Ford Mustang is based on the current longest living platform in the American auto industry and probably of the American market as well  the current Mustang is based in the Fox platform first used in the 1978 Ford Fairmont   Mercury Zephyr  Maybe they are not sure whether this is a good or a bad thing to let people know  If you ask me I think is a great thing  Why  Lets see First  Mustang was able to retain the rear wheel drive configuration that is the way a pony car is meant to be  In the late 80 s Ford tried to make a front wheel driver out of the Mustang but at the very last minute they backed up  The result was the Ford Probe  not a bad car in any respect  but definitely not a Mustang  Maybe a Celica or a Prelude but not a Mustang Second  Is really cheap to buy  own  maintain and repair Third  Ford has had over 24 years to improve this platform and it shows Mustang 3 8 V 6 Convertible Ride  The Ford Mustang 3 8 V 6 convertible with a stick shift is a really fun car to drive  In a very different and less relaxed way however  than more sophisticated entries in the market  Mustang is all about rough power and it shows all the time  Is a throw back to the days of the original pony cars but with a very contemporary feel  provided by a extremely well behave steering  quick to respond and very linear  The ride is the best you can expect from a rear wheel driver with a solid axle rear suspension and that does not mean is bad at all  It actually is a very enjoyable ride with a very distinctive American flavor  Cowl shake is not nearly as bad as you would expect from a convertible in this price field  but there is some  which I guess is the price you have to pay in exchange for the pleasures of open air motoring  Interior  Seats are supportive enough if you are not an NBA player and there is plenty of space in the front cabin  and nearly none in the back  which anyway is a given in the pony car segment  Interior materials are far from being the best and I would advice to take a good look at Ford s accessories catalog to personalize an  although well designed  monochromatic and cheap looking interior  None of the above means that the instrumentation is not well laid out and that controls are not at the reach of your hand when needed Power  Power is more than adequate  190 hp inV 6 form moves the Mustang convertible from 0 to 60 mph in 7 7 seconds  this is former GT territory Top  Convertible top is simple  fast and powered  Two latches  one switch and no roof Many may not agree  but to me Mustang looks super sexy especially in convertible form The current Mustang is the best value you can find if what you are looking for is power  No other car offers you such bang for your buck  now that the Camaro   Firebird twins were killed by corporate father GM  and those two were super uncomfortable cars anyway The all new 2004 Ford Mustang will be based in the DEW98 platform  the state of the art base for the Ford Thunderbird  Lincoln LS and Jaguar S Type  That will be a whole different proposition and will see about it then Surprisingly good quality
