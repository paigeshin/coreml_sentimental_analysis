 I bought my new 1999 Ford Taurus just two months ago  but I m in love  My former car  a  91 Mercury Sable had given me so much grief that I was desperate for something new  I bought the Taurus from my local dealer for  19K plus tax  tag  and title  It had everything I wanted  leather seats  sunroof  CD changer  red paint job  powerful engine  I have the 24 valve V 6 Duratec  I have always driven boring cars  boring to look at and boring to drive  and I thought about buying a convertible since I live at the beach  but I couldn t be happier than I am with this car  The sunroof lets me enjoy the weather without the hassle of a convertible  The engine is great   lots of pickup  The interior is comfortable and looks really rich with all the leather  The exterior design and the  quot Toreador Red quot  paint give it the kind of style that makes people notice it  My boyfriend drools over my car  He calls it  quot a chic car with balls quot  I have always been a Ford fan  and this car should keep me that way for a long time  My biggest complaint so far about the car is the puny size of the gas tank  Even though I m getting very good mileage  26 and better  I have to fill up more frequently than I did with my Sable  Other minor complaints  the cupholders are awkward to get to and won t hold my favorite coffee mug  and the controls for the climate control and the radio are confusing to look at   takes a few minutes to find the button you want  If you were very tall  fortunately  I m not  you might find the ceiling to be a bit low  especially since the interior is so curvy  The roof curves in right over the driver s head  This is a great car for someone who wants a sporty car that isn t TOO teenager ish  It s a solid  reliable Ford with a lot of fun features br br
