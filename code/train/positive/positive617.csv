 I was originally looking for a Honda and willing to pay the extra thousands of dollars I saved when I purchased my Ford Escort ZX2 Starting college in Sept I ll have enough expenses without spending a lot on a car  I didn t even know what a Ford Escort was and when I was looking for cars  It caught my eye  It s good on gas and has the power to get up and go  I wish it had a little more leg room in the back for passengers but as the driver I don t have any complaints  I drove a Toyota Camry prior to my escort and I don t feel any difference in the way it handles  I basically will use my car to commute to school Anyone looking for a economical car should check out the ZX2  You ll be surprised it s a Ford Escort  Excellent for moms with small children since it is a two door  Being a two door it is a little difficult for larger people to get in and out of the back as any two door might be
