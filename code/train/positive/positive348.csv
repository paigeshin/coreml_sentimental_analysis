 A few years ago we bought a Ford Explorer used at the dealership where it had originally been purchased  Three years ago we traded it for a custom van  I miss my Ford Explorer so much The ride was comfortable  and the seats were so comfortable  Throughout the time we had it  there were the regular maintenance needed  It did get to the point of needing the transmission replaced  the repair shop never told us it needed to be serviced  So when we had the transmission replaced we decided to trade it before it started needed more work Even though we have a van now  it was easier to carry groceries or anything in the back of the Explorer  I hope to buy another Explorer or perhaps an Expedition after the van is paid off br br
