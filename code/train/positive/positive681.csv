 I am definitely not a Ford girl  Everyone I have ever known who has owned a Ford has called it a nightmarish experience  Then there are the cute acronyms    quot Found On Road Dead quot  or  quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  This past week  however  I drove a car that might start to change my mind  I had the delight of driving a 2000 Ford Focus  If I were to ever break down and purchase a Ford  this would have to be the car for me When I first sat in the car  it looked like the interior of a jet  The dash board is designed so that all the controls for the air conditioning and the radio as within a comfortable reach of the arm  Therefore  the driver need not lean in anyway to adjust the radio or control the temperature  Often when people lean with their bodies inside the car to do anything  they accidentally steer the car in that direction  Not needing to lean over to make these adjustments may avoid an accident The gas pedal offers just the right amount of tension  The driver need not press the pedal all the way to the floor just to go sixty  but it is not so sensitive that you sneeze and  poof  your doing 110  The overdrive control button is on the gear shift  This was a new one to me because I had never even heard of overdrive before  The chairs were designed for the ultimate in comfort  The seat on the driver s chair has a crank which allows you to adjust the seat back to the correct position for you using the minimalist of adjustment  The steering wheel telescopes as well as tilts  The turn signals are fairly quiet and unobtrusive  so you are not stuck at a light with your turn signal on hearing an annoying  quot CLICK  CLICK  CLICK quot  The light which illuminates the dash board is soft and not glaring  The head lights are adjusted using a dial on the dash to the driver s left  which change the lights from off  to parking lamps  to head lights  The brights come on by clicking the turn signal wand toward you once  On most 1999 compacts  I could not even find the control for the brights  Another light control which is usually difficult for me to find is the hazards  On the Ford Focus  the hazard lights are controlled by a button on the dash  right above the radio where you cannot miss it  The car s gas tank fills with about  11  The trunk has a phenomenal amount of room  The cabin is large enough so that my boyfriend who is 6 8 quot  could sit comfortably The car has many safety feature  too  It comes with air bags  It also comes with special anchors along the top of the back seat to better secure a child s safety seat  It has a gear lock   a safety feature which allows you to lock the gears so that you cannot move the car out of park with out pressing down on the break first  The trunk has a latch on the inside that allows you to pop the trunk if you should get locked inside it  This is a safety feature I think that any person with children should look for in a car It also comes equipped with quite a few luxury items which I never knew existed  but now want in every car I own  It has a clear digital mileage display  The top display is the amount of miles you traveled that day  and the bottom display is the total miles traveled  The cabin light does not just turn off suddenly   it fades to black  The radio has an option that allows it to become louder when the engine revs  and softer as the car slows down so that you can always hear your radio comfortably  The air conditioning system does not just go from hot to cold  but has many subtle levels in between Allot of thought was put into every aspect of the Ford Focus  This car was a dream to handle  maneuvered easily  and was a joy to drive  I do not think I even scratched the surface  but for the six days I had the car  I practically lived in it  If I could find a car that even equals the Ford Focus  I might get it  But  in the end  I think I may just have to break down and buy this car br br
