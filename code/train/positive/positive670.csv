 I am originally from NYC  No one there drive as pickup primary car  The Explorer Sport Trac breaks all the rule and whenever  I drive my ride home people stop and ask me so many questions about this good looking ride  Never in a million years did I think I would ever be caught in a pickup  Not only that you think parrallel parking would be difficult  especially in NYC  I have put this baby in some spaces  Ford went way out on this ride by combining the comfort of the SUV EXPLORER and F150 Truck to come up with a ride both woman and men could take pleasure  The Sport Trac definitely makes a statement about ones personality and a taste This four door pickup truck easily accommodates four 6 ft men  Fully powered Even the automatic rear window is great feature  The sound system alone blows most cars off the road  Equipped with not only standard speakers  This ride roars with bottom  BASS  Just like a night club  with all the windows rolled up and volume at set at half sounds heard outside the car are crystal clear Long distance driving is a breeze  Comfortable and great on gas  Switch 2 to 4 wheel drive  high or low in a breeze  Air conditioning is great  I spent tow in in Charleston  SC and it get hot down there  The best part is the bed  This sure comes in handy  Of course it is larger than a car trunk put smaller than a standard size bed  However  you can fit most anything in there I purchased this vehicle last October 2001 for my birthday and what I love most is this is simply a great looking all around multi purpose truck that I am proud to take anywhere whether it to the supermarket or waiting valet attendant  This SUV MPV Pick up truck turns heads and burns rubber when I have to
