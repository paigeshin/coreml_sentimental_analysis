 I Love my Ford Expedition  I purchased my expedition in August 1999 and have been driving it since  I have two kids who are involved in all sports and this car has been the best for transporting them from place to place  There is more than enough room for anything needed  balls  equipment etc  This car is very dependable and comfortable  The gas mileage is not the best  but what do you expect for a big vehicle  It is a great vehicle to travel in not only is it spacious  but all the extras are wonderful  I recently traveled eight hours with my two kids and it sure was nice for each kid to have their own seat and their own air controls  I even felt safe on the freeway  The expedition also has good suspension and brake pedals to adjust to the driver  Before purchasing the Expedition  I test drove other SUV s and I have to say this is the best in it s class  After being in the Expedition other SUV s felt generic to me especially the Chevy Tahoe  But then  what do you expect from CHEVY br br
