 I chose this vehicle for several reasons  mainly the ability to comfortably carry a family of four  haul lots of stuff and tow  It is used to carry construction supplies and debris  take the family and accompanying baggage toys camping or traveling and tow various things  boats  trailers  etc  It does all of these things very well I bought the Eddie Bauer version  2wd  5L  auto trans  towing package  My commute is comfortable  Even during long drives to New England all the family has adequate room  The size of the truck gives a good ride The truck weighs about 4500  with fuel driver  I ve crossed the scales at the landfill weighing 6800  On one occasion  pulling a trailer load of asphalt to be recycled  the combined weight was over 14 000  Okay maybe I ve overloaded once in awhile The truck now has 109 000 miles on it  Oil is changed regularly  tires rotated every 5 10 000k miles  I ve had NO PROBLEMS with it  The original tires weren t replaced until 63 000 miles  Still the original brakes with   20  wear left  good for another 15 000 miles or so  Fuel mileage is around 15mpg  which I consider reasonable for the way I drive  Two fuel tanks are a nice thing to have If this truck ever becomes a repair problem  175 200k miles  I will definitely purchase another Ford  Probably a bigger one If you want a vehicle that does many things well and reliably  this is it If you want something to zip around the city in  you may consider something else  Although there is the intimidation factor
