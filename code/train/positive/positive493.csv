 The Escape is not a classic SUV  it has unibody construction instead of the  classic  SUV s  body on frame  truck like design Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute are brothers  Both cars were developed jointly by Ford and Mazda  part of Mazda belongs to Ford   I think something like 35 b ENGINES  The base front dive Escape uses the Focus s 4 cylinder 2 0 L 120 hp Zetec engine  the optional V 6 Duratec 3 0 L engine  that Ford also uses in Taurus  has 200 horsepower and 200 pound feet of torque  According to  Car and Driver  magazine  the V 6 version  Escape XLT  runs quarter mile for 16 8 seconds at 83 mph V 6 equipped Escape goes from zero to 60 mph in 8 8 seconds  and gets 24 mpg on the highway b TRANSMISSIONS  The manual transmission equipped model has a floor shifter  but the automatic transmission  CD4E four speed  has a column shifter  b i I hate column shifters i b  You cannot get the manual transmission with V 6  Not cool b SIZE  The size is about Honda CR V but the Escape feels larger than a Honda  With the rear seats up  there is 33 cubic feet of storage space  with the seats folded down   63 cubic feet b WHEELS  There are two types of wheels available   15  and 16  The V 6 Escape XLT uses P235 70TR 16 Firestone Wilderness HT tires  The spare tire is 17  temporary one The tires are a little bit too noisy over the rough pavement b SUSPENSION  Escape uses independent suspension  which offers good ride quality  The brakes are equipped with ABS  front disc  rear drum  The stopping distance from 70 mph is 171 feet   better than  any  other SUV  FYI  It takes Nissan Xterra 199 feet   OFF ROAD  Escape XLT weights about 3550 pound Escape  I read that Escape s off road capabilities are challenged  comparing to the real SUVs  However  with available four wheel drive  they are much better than any sedan s  Escape uses the Control Trac II all wheel drive system  which allows the Escape to run in front wheel drive until the system senses the wheel slippage  Then it sends up to  100 b  of the engine s torque to the rear wheels until the slippage stops  Escape has a  4x4 On  switch that does not engage the four wheel drive permanently  but engages the rear drive more quickly  which is better for severe conditions   PRICING  The base front drive Escape XLS  with the 4  cylinder 2 0 L Zetec engine and a five speed manual transmission  starts at  18 160  At this price the car has air conditioning  an AM FM stereo with a CD player  remote keyless entry  a tilting steering wheel  and power locks  windows  and mirrors The  upscale  Escape XLT has ABS  aluminum wheels  cruise control  and fog lamps  It costs  19 710  Nice price  don t you think b OPTIONS  The 3 0 L V 6 Duratec adds  1400 to the XLS and  1480 to the XLT and Control Trac all wheel drive system adds  1625 The XLT model with the V 6 and all wheel drive automatically gets the  350 Class II trailer towing package  which ups towing capacity from 2000 pounds to 3500 Also available are leather trim  a power glass sunroof  and front side airbags  MACH audio system that replaces the in dash CD player with in dash six disc changer The Escape is located between classic large SUVs and midsize cars  It uses carlike unibody construction and independent suspension  available 4 wheel drive is  civilaized   I hope  if you want an SUV  you will get Escape  It handles well  has excellent brakes and lots of cabin space  And the fuel economy is very good i
