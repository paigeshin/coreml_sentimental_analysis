 We own a 95 Windstar  With the rising prices of mini vans a used one is a good option for many people and 95 Windstars are easy to find and reasonably priced for a family We bought our s in Nov 1997 and it had 30 000 miles on it  We bought it because of it s safety rating  safest mini van made  and it s roominess In the last 2 1 2 years I have learned a lot about this vehicle  I ve driven it in snow  wind  rain  long trips etc Good points  Roomy one of the largest mini vans made  Plenty of leg room in the first and second row  An adult can stand  bent over  next to the seats and maneuver children and items fairly easily Fast  The Windstar has great pick up  which is vital when getting on busy highways  It has a 3 8L engine which makes all the difference in the world Mileage  As minivans go  it isn t bad  I can get about 380 400 miles on one tank  21 gallons Visibility  You can see everything around you very well  No terrible blindspots  at least for me Handling  Drives like a car  not a large van Bad points Buggy transmission  The transmission is sensitive  If you don t have it lined up JUST RIGHT you will not really be in park  drive  reverse etc  You must always use your emergency brake on the slightest incline Heavy second and third seats  The second and third seats are removable but not on wheels  The second seat can be removed by one person without much trouble but the third seat really takes two  It is not impossible  just a pain Overall  I really like the vehicle and would buy another and recommend it  The pros outweigh the cons  I happily put up with the heavier seats and lack of drivers side sliding door for the extra room br br
