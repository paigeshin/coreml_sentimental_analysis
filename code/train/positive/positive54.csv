 In previous years I always thought of the Taurus as my Grandfather s first choice  but since the revamp of few years ago my whole opinion has changed Over the past twelve years I have always driven T Bird s  but in 1997 the T Bird was put to rest for a major overhaul and I began to look at the Taurus  I am really glad that I did First off  the interior is really comfortable and roomy for this size vehicle  The dashboard contains exactly what you need  speedodometer  fuel  and a few other things that you need to know  The sound system is outstanding for a stock item  A C and heat perfect  One of my favorite items is the flip up console which is hidden under the arm rest  this allows you to use it or hide it  In the console you can store eight cassettes and has space for that soda coffee on the way to work  The back seats flip down for access to the trunk  not a feature that I would ever use  but I am glad that it is there  Speaking of the trunk  I have not seen this type of space on vehicles this size in many many years Performance and handling have been more than I could expect  Gas mileage has been a very respectable as most of my driving is over the tollway freeway  Appearance and paint surface are brilliant and show no sign of fading over the past two years  Interior buttons dials are large and very easy to access from the drivers seat  One nice feature is the drivers side power window has a  quot one push quot  down button  touch it and your window opens all the way  I know it sounds silly that I cant hold the little button for a few seconds  but I really like the one touch feature Visibility is great  todate I have not had any issues of blind spots With all the good  I do have one item that is poor  When driving on the freeway  exactly at 55MPH   and either the driver or passenger window is down there is a very annoying wind vibration that fills the car  I can t really explain this sound  but it is kind of like a monk humming over and over and over directly behind your head rest This vehicle that comes in under  20K is well worth your investment  I never thought I would own drive a Taurus  but I sure am glad that Ford took this car back from Grandpa br br
