 The car is one of the best I have driven but if you live on a gravel road you are in for some surprises  The gravel roads tend to put the car to the limit  I have occasionally had to do some adjustments to the cars suspension system and had to rewire some of the wiring in order to get the car to perform the way it was intended  A few of the places that need to be fixed were the dash lights i had to put in a wire protector in order to keep the wires from wearing from the bumps on the road  The other problem i have had is with the courtesy lamp after about 1 year of driving it i had to replace it because the switch fused together and kept blowing fuses  The car I really don t think was meant for driving on gravel roads  Another problem is you have to constantly have to lubricate ALL hinges and locks in order to keep them from locking up and causing damage  These things are minor but they provide numerous headaches if you are not expecting them to happen
