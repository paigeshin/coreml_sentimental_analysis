 I bought my Aerostar Van brand new in 1992  I still drive and enjoy my van to this very day  Every time I think about trading it in for a newer vehicle I can t think of anything I would rather have to drive  I bought the extended version of the Aerostar because I wanted and needed the extra space  I can get all my groceries in the back  the kids toys and necessities when traveling to Grandma s house  and when going on a long trip suitcases and everything the kids  quot have to bring quot  along fit nicely in the extend space  I just don t understand how people who have regular mini vans fit everything in when going on vacations  I can t imagine what the passenger area looks like  The extend area of the Aerostar allows for comfortable and less crowded seating when hauling items  The seats are removable allowing for even more room for hauling large items  We have carried lumber  furniture  mattresses  and even key stones in the back of our Aerostar van  It is almost like having a truck and van in one  The seats are not easily removed and it can be necessary to have help in taking them out My Aerostar is currently 8 years old and all I have ever really had to replace is regular wear and tear items  I ve only had to replace the brakes twice and it is on it s second set of tires  One thing I don t like about the Aerostar is that when the brakes get wet  and you go to use them  they are extremely touchy  They are so touchy that everyone is jerked forward when you touch the brakes  Usually this only happens during the first couple of times of using them until they dry out It is for these reasons that I still haven t had the desire to trade my old Aerostar Van in for a newer and fancier van  I value the extended part of the van too much to get a newer one that doesn t offer the extra room in the back  I could care less about dual side opening doors  remote door openers  or less mileage just give me more rear space and I m a happy camper br br
