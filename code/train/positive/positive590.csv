 We originally bought the Bronco because it suited our family needs  The wife and I have 2 growing boys and 2 dogs  The Bronco is a great vehicle to comfortably haul the whole crew around It is also surprisingly easy to drive  with power everything  the size of the vehicle is generally not an issue  We love the easy viewing from on high and the basic ruggedness The Bronco even makes a nice cross country traveler  getting about 17 miles to the gallon on the highway Unfortunately  the in town mileage tends to hover around 10 mpg  It is a thirsty beast The quality of the vehicle was generally good  but we did have one major complaint  Before the 15 000 mile mark  we replaced the front brake rotors and calipers because they had warped  This caused an annoying pulsing sensation when braking  We took it to Ford several times  where they would turn the rotors only to have them warp again within the next 1000 miles or so  After 3 trips to Ford  we went to aftermarket components  Sperry  which cured the problem and actually provided better feel than stock  Cost was  450 00 The Bronco is a vehicle that gives a lot of satisfaction  but is not necessarily going to be cheap to feed or maintain  We would recommend it to folks who really need a rugged  powerful SUV and are willing to pay for it br br
