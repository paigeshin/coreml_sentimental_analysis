 I ve driven Fords since I got my Mustang when I was 16  From there  I bought a Cougar  then an Explorer  I now drive an Eddie Bauer Expedition  I guess the one common denominator with all my Fords is the awesome air conditioner  Living in Texas  with our summers  air conditioning is very important and I believe they get a good testing here when the temperature reaches over 100 for days in a row  To make matters more interesting  my current Expedition is black  While driving home from visiting relatives several months ago  I blew up the engine in my Expedition  I had just had the oil changed that morning  I crept into the nearest Ford dealership in Mineral Wells Texas and was given the bad news  Ford paid for all but  1000 of the new engine and most of my rental car for the next 3 weeks  What happened to the engine  I do not know  Did Ford handle the problem correctly  I don t know  The interior of the Expedition has met all my expectations  There is ample leg room in the second seat for adults as well as children  Behind the back seat is enough space for groceries without moving the third seat at all  With the third seat folded down  I have been able to tote anything I have need to  even with 5 kids and a dog  Golf clubs  trips to Sams  camping trips  etc  have all been accomplished without me ever having to take out the seat  The radio and CD player have been fine with good sound and easy to manipulate knobs and buttons  The handle in the back seat that hangs from the ceiling has gotten loose  and the clothes hook has come off on one side  Otherwise I have had no interior problems at all  I know that the car runs well  however  my prized possession  the great air conditioning  is not the same  It takes almost an hour to get the ice cold air I used to have immediatly  I have plenty of freon  and no one knows the problem  I will be getting a new car in the next 6 months or so and I probably will not be buying another Ford  Not because of anything except I guess at 36 years old I should drive something else so I can have a reference to compare it with
