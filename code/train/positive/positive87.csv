 We traded in our Ford Explorer on an 1998 Eddie Bauer Expedition and it was the best choice we have made by far  The cabin is roomy  the seats comfortable and easy to clean when the little ones get them dirty and feels like you re riding on air  I do wish we had a more current model  since now the foot pedals on the 2000 models adjust to peoples height  as I am 5 4 quot  I would like that little perk  This SUV turns on a dime  which is great compared to the Crew Cab Ford Pickup we used to own  Much easier to handle in those parking lots at the mall  amp  grocery store  In addition  I didn t know that there was airbag suspension we bought the Expedition  but there is  and it makes it a much more comfortable ride compared to that jolty Explorer  I would recommend this vehicle to a family of three to seven  and the smaller the family  the better for a roadtrip  We just take out the third seat and pile up the back with our stuff  I highly recommend this one br br
