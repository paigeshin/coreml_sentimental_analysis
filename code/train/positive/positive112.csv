 I bought my car in 1995  It was built in 1993  I was in college at the time  and it was perfect for my lifestyle  It is a fun  sporty car that was just right for a college girl  Since I ve been married  I wish I had picked a slightly more practical model  There is very little room for groceries  yard stuff and other things that you have to buy when you live in an adult world with a house  And the backseat is a real pain in the neck to crawl in and out of I haven t given it up though  because I love zooming around in it  The radio is great  the car is comfy  and it handles wonderfully  I have had more than what I consider average problems with it  The brakes  exhaust  and muffler have all had to be replaced  The trunk latch has been broken for the past year or so  which makes it next to impossible to put anything in the trunk  The lighter was broken for awhile Overall  this is a wonderful car if you have a lifestyle conducive to a sports car but no money for a sports car br br
