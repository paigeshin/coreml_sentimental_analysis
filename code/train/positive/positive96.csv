 I got this truck new and it took all my money but it was worth it since it s a keeper  I thought it was a bust at first because it kept going into 4 wheel drive for no reason but I just called the Ford assistance line and they sent a tow truck out  It turned out that the factory had left an extra spring shackle wedged in the front end somewhere which would rub on the front axle when you turned causing the automatic hubs to engage  Anyway  they fixed it for free  There was a problem with the rivets on the frame but they fixed that for free too  The only thing they don t fix for free is the automatic hubs which went out once on me  I figure they need fixing once every three years which is better than getting out to lock them manually  I didn t like how low the truck sat so I got a 4  lift  big tires  and this reverse shackle thing on the front which makes it ride better on the freeway where it s all rippled  It s an animal on the ranches  goes up anything  even when the roads are washed out  Once  I dropped the right rear in a ditch and the left front was in the air and I had to pull it out with the dozer but that s the only time it got stuck  It s got this turbo charged  power stroke diesel which will out accelerate the 460 gas version here in California  Some people don t like it making a lot of noise but I don t care  I live in the country
