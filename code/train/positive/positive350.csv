 After wreaking the other car we decided on a mid sized car  Well we have had it for about 3 weeks and are really enjoying it  It seats 6 comfortably  3 in the front and 3 in the back  it has auto windows  with a window lock power door locks lots of foot space in the front and back and power steering  I am really enjoying the power steering  it turns corners so easy and smoothly The comfort level in the car is great And talk about trunk space  The trunk is huge You could probably fit a small calf in it I highly reccomend this car br br
