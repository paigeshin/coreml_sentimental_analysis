 I bought this truck new  had 800 Miles on it  that s new in my book  about 2 weeks ago  Although I have only had it for a short time  I find the ride very enjoyable  on the highway as well as through town  Through town the ride is a little bumpy  but it  quot is quot  a pickup truck  Considering its center of gravity is a little higher than the standard models  because of the 235 tires  It corners fairly well for a pickup truck The 4 0L V6 provides plenty of power  decent acceleration as well as a good amount of torque  I get about 17 Miles to the gallon on the Highway  that s traveling between 75 and 85 MPH  It also has good mid level acceleration  from 35 to 65 MPH  The truck boasts a top speed of about 102MPH  The 5 gear automatic transmission s shifting is almost unnoticeable even under heavy acceleration  It is also equipped with an overdrive switch to limit the transmission to the 4 base gears for those up and down back road trips we all love so much  The cast aluminum deep dish wheels look very sharp on this truck  Another nice feature is the Vacuum Lock 4X4 switching  which allows the truck to be switched from 2w high to 4w high and back to 2w high at almost any speed  The interior of the truck is well laid out  The 60 40 split front seat is quite comfortable  and the center fold up Arm Rest tape holder CD holder Change holder is also a very nice feature  Although the cab is pretty roomy  It is hard for me to imagine 2 grown adults being able to sit on the tiny fold down seats provided in the extended cab  The space within the extended portion of the cab is made super accessible by the two fold out doors on either side  These doors are very well hidden  so well hidden in fact it took me 2 days to realize my new truck was actually a 4 door  There is plenty of room for a great deal of cargo back there  And loading and unloading is a snap My advice for someone thinking of purchasing one of these trucks  is to go with the Extended Cab 4x4 with the 4 0L V6  I have heard from many that the 3 0L V6 and the 2 5L 4 are both under powered for this truck   Besides bigger is usually better  Once I have had this truck a little longer and have more info about the reliability I will write some more reviews on it  I am also planning on making some modifications on this truck which I will also share with you all br br
