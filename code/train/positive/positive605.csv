 I recently had to rent a car after a snowy truck accident  So they gave me a Ford Focus from enterprise Exterior The new  edge  styling looks pretty cool  It s modern and attractive for a car in my opinion  The wheelbase is a little longer than a comparable Honda Civic Interior The dashboard is clean and functional  The instrument panel also has that new  modern  look and feel to it  The stereo and a c settings are pretty easy to use  and the buttons are well defined and easy to access The stereo reception isn t the greatest and the system is sub par overall The seats are pretty comfortable but lacks in lumbar support and armrest  I still found it to be fairly comfortable for everyday driving Driving Experience It surprisingly handled pretty well for a car in its class  Very European like feel  However  the steering wheel tended to vibrate a lot over rough pavement  And be prepared for a noisy ride The ride is actually pretty comfortable  I was pleasantly surprised  It s a bit on the firm side  and you still feel all the road s irregularities  but it s a lot better than most cars in its class The one thing that did bother me a bit was the amount of road engine noise  I ve heard that a comparable Hyundai Elantra does an excellent job of keeping the road engine noise down  and that car costs less than a comparable Ford Focus  Something for the Ford engineers to shoot for  This is a great value and its great fun to drive My only complaints are the noise and the always vibrating steering wheel It would have got a 4 star if it wasn t for that annoying vibrating steering wheel  trust me  it vibrates like crazy
