 I bought my 1995 4 door hatchback Aspire used from my neighbor  It had 70 000 miles on it and I paid  2 000 for it  I just love this little car  My boyfriend is tall and was very surprised about how much leg room he has in it  I get excellent gas mileage  40 mpg  Its air conditioner has a hard time while driving in town and sitting in traffic  but works fine when on the open road  It will go fast speeds  85  if you are in a hurry  but does tend to start vibrating at 70  Excellent for shopping trips  fits well into tight parking places  and has plenty of cargo space  I drive this more than my new 4 wheel drive Ford Ranger  I really enjoy owning this little car
