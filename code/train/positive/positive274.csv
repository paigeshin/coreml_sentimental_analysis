 Okay I have to admit this is my first Ford  Up until 1997 when I bought my Ford Explorer Sport new  I had always been a Volkswagen girl  I LOVE the way Volkswagens handle and look but I spent more time gettin  them repaired then driving  em So in 1997  I decided to shop around for an SUV and fell in love with the Explorer Sport THe Explorer is the most reliable car I have owned  I never worry about getting stuck somewhere because the engine won t start or having it  die  on the freeway  NOT fun in L A  I have 70 000 miles on it and have only needed routine maintenance on it oil changes  filters  brakes  Oh and then there was that minor recall on the tires  Of course I m grateful that nobody was ever injured because of my Firestone tires  I have to admit though  that in my situation  the recall worked in my favor I had 60 000 miles on my car when the recall began and needed new tires I got 5 brand new tires for free  I should comment that since trading in my Firestones for better quality Michelins  the ride in much smoother  If you re worried about a  bumpy  Explorer  or any other SUV  the tires will make all the difference in the world Since I don t have children  the 2 door Sport works for me  If you have children or frequent rear seat passengers  you may want to consider the 4 door  In the Sport  the rear seat is not the easiest to get into and getting car seats in and out is time consuming The standard stereo with CD player sounds great speakers are high quality  I cannot drive without tunes in my car so this was important to me  The interior is attractive richer looking than other SUVs  in my humble opinion and the body style still looks current  despite Ford s yearly body style updates on Explorers The mileage is not that great I would say I get on average 15 16 MPG and I drive a 5 speed  still got the original clutch  When I lived 30 miles from work  60 miles roundtrip  this was a problem  Too much time and money at the gas station  But now that I am 4 miles from work  I only fill up once a week and am much happier  Poor gas mileage comes with owning a big car Ford Explorer or other I highly recommend the Ford Explorer  People tend to either love or hate Fords  I ve heard it all Ford stands for  Found On Road Dead  blah blah blah  but I can t say enough good things about my Ford  It is the best car I have owned  When I first purchased it  I thought I would keep it for 2  3 years tops  But why give up a good thing
