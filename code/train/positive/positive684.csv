 I had the opportunity to rent a 5 door Focus in Germany earlier this year  I drove it from Cologne down to Mannheim and back twice  and also hit the twisties along the Mosel river  The car is excellent  Absolutely no wind noise  very little road noise  and decent if not abundant  power  The car easily cruises at 90   100 mph even in the uphill sections  The car also does a respectable job in the stoplight grand prix if the competition is not to stout  I can only confirm what has already been written about the handling  even with the skinny rental tires It is too bad that the 5 door apparently isn t sold here in the US  It is the best version with the versatility of the 4 doors with the styling of the coupe  The driving position fit this 6 4 quot  240 pounder perfectly I also rented a 4 door sedan with auto trans here in the US  Other than the expected lack of grunt with the auto I found this version a superb car br br
