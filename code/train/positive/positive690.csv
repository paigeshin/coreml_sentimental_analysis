 The 2000 Ford Focus SE 4 door sedan has a spacious interior and a solid feel  I m the only person in my neighborhood to own one  and nearby friends and acquaintances regularly ask me how this stylish and affordable car performs Among the first things I tell them is to spend a little extra money and buy a Focus model that includes the perky 16 valve Zetec engine  This adds several hundred dollars to the purchase price  but the investment is worth it if you value passing performance on the freeway and climbing ability on hills  I drove 2000 and 2001 models with the underpowered standard engine and came away disappointed  Zetec is definitely the way to go Ford engineered the Focus to provide a roomy interior and did so with great success  My head always bumped the ceiling in my Escort  the car I traded when I bought the Focus in November 2000  Head rattling is not an issue with the Focus  Seat height is adjustable  and leg room for a person of my height  6 ft  is more than ample  Front seat passengers gain the most from the cab forward design  Passengers in the rear may feel a bit squeezed if passengers in the front use the maximum amount of legroom My Focus came with a CD player and AM FM radio  Sound quality is not concert like  but I didn t expect it to be  I d rate it better than adequate I ve read a number of reviews that said the Focus was  fun  to drive  Let me jump on that bandwagon  too  Steering is responsive and the car  which has 15 inch tires  hugs the road One caution to prospective purchasers  read the manual  The Focus comes with several design features that initially may create the appearance of being minor malfunctions  One of these is the air conditioning light that signals the air conditioning is in use  During certain times  this light comes on automatically as part of a design feature that  apparently  dehumidifies the air in the car to minimize frosting  I ve read some reviews in which people didn t read the owner s manual and reported a suspected malfunction of the air conditioning unit The styling on the Focus also appeals to me  and to my inquisitive neighbors  The SE model I own has power windows and door locks  keyless entry  tilt wheel  cruise control and other options  Gas mileage is about 32 on the highway   not great  but good  Trunk room is surprisingly adequate One small problem is that the cup holders can t accommodate large beverages  Another problem is that the car doesn t seem well insulated against road noise Hey  I regularly drive a Saturn and a Toyota Corolla  The Focus beats them readily in performance  interior room and value  I am very pleased with this purchase
