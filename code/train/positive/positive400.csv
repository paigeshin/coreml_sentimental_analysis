 Ford did a brilliant job when it created the mustang  It is sleek and powerful  Just driving the car can make anybody feel young again Mustangs come in three varieties  standard V6  GT version  and SVT  Generally it correspods to what type of engine you get  the latter being the more powerful  The best part about owning a mustang is that the interior of the mustang Base V6 is the same as the GT or the SVT save the emblems  You don t feel like you are getting the base model  it feels like your getting the best model I own a 97 v6 mustang and my roomate has a 99 SVT  We both love our mustangs  We know that not many other cars can keep up with us  Say a mustang vs a civic  or a mustang vs a prelude  I think for the price the mustang is the best car out there  Just knowing there is something powerful under the hood and the car is not just looks is one of the things that make a mustang great When driving a mustang  the whole sports car feel is there  A stiff suspension  a nice sounding engine  and a instument panel that has gauges for everything  One thing though  It would have been better if the mustang had four wheel independent suspension  but it still handles very well The mustang is not as quiet as say a lexus  but it isn t supposed to be  You are supposed to hear the roar of the engine when driving a sports car  The sound only adds to the effect Only people who can picture themselves in a sports car should buy a mustang  One thing though  you must be sure of your driving skills because one your behind the wheel you will really want to drive it br br
