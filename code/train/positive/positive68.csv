 When my friend Brian called me and told me he had bought a new car to replace his 1995 Ford Explorer  I thought he bought a more sensible car  maybe a sedan or something  Nope  I was completely wrong  Brain bought a 2001   Ford Expedition   with Eddie Bauer trim  Boy  that is quite a truck The   Expedition   is so large that it resembles a small school bus  However  it doesn t drive like a school bus  not that I have ever driven a school bus  and certainly doesn t look like one when you consider all that the   Expedition   offers i  So What Does it Offer     I know nothing about the engine and so forth  so I am focusing mostly on the interior of the car and the exterior appearance      You could use those as a mirror    Chrome  Boy  it sure is beautiful  I am not sure I would want to keep up with chrome  having to polish it and keep it clean and so forth  but it sure is pretty to look at on other people s cars  The   Expedition   has lots of chrome to look at  Between its chrome bumpers  both front and rear  and its chrome wheels  there are plenty of shiny surfaces to look at  Too bad you have to keep them polished and clean      Brrrr  It is cold  Darn  The windows and mirrors are fogging up    As it did today in D C  sometimes it snows  And snows  And snows  And other times  it ices  But then there are also the times when the windows just fog up  With the good old American defrosters on the   Expedition    that ice or snow or fog will melt right off  But what about the mirrors  They fog up and get icy as well  How do you clear those  Well  the   Expedition   offers something new and exciting  heated mirrors  No more foggy mirrors that wind up being useless  De fog them and they are ready to go    Speaking of the cold and the fog    Fog lamps  The Eddie Bauer line comes standard with fog lamps mounted below the regular head lamps  Fog lamps are not only for show  they also do help you maneuver in the fog  Another cool feature  heated seats  The driver and passenger seats are both heated  A very nice addition for those cold tushies  And  there is also automatic temperature control  Set the thermostat at  say  72 degrees  and it will stay there  automatically    Daddy  where should I put this    When you have little kids  or are just a pack rat yourself  you need lots of storage  Brian has two little girls  who are always in need of a tissue  another pacifier  a different CD  a cracker  or something else  Well  where do you put all those things that a child might need  How about in your ample storage  There are two consoles in the   Expedition    floor and overhead  The floor console has a general storage compartment  a coin holder  headphone jacks  a tissue holder  and 4 cupholders  The overhead console has map lights  sunglasses holder  a holder for your garage door opener  and a compass  Overall  there are 6 cupholders throughout the  quot cabin quot  of the   Expedition       Going on a trip    There is plenty of room for cargo  As long as you remove the 3rd seat  more on this in a minute  there is a large area for cargo  There are cargo tie downs on the floor of the truck and a luggage rack on the top of the truck  on the cargo rack  It is easy to add some small packages to the cargo by opening only the glass on the rear hatch  There is a window door split so that you can open only the glass or can open both glass and door together    Someone has been driving my truck    Brian is exceptionally tall  so when I got in the truck to drive it  I  of course  needed to adjust EVERYTHING ranging from the seat to the pedals  there are adjusting pedals for different height people  But when Brian gets back in the truck  there is a memory feature that resets the seat  mirrors  and pedals to his original setting  NICE    Daddy  I m bored    When going on long trips  the girls often get bored  The nice thing is  Brian s new car has a rear seat entertainment center  complete with a VHS VCR  Now Brian can put on a movie to keep the girls occupied during the trips  I am sure that is a Godsend  And  for the adults  entertainment  there is a 6 CD changer standard with the truck    Analog Gages    voltage  oil  water temperature  speed  odometer  fuel    Warning Lights    door ajar  4 wheel drive  seat belts  low washer fluid  bright  highbeam  lights on  Anti Lock Brakes  Cruise Control  parking brake  low fuel  check engine  airbag  temperature  low oil pressure  turn signals  and security system    Power locks  Windows  and Cruise Control      Removable Third Row Bench Seat      Remote Entry  Child Proof Doors  Airbags   Overall  I think this is a great truck  I don t see any negatives yet  except for the fact that it gets horrible gas mileage and that it is so expensive  Overall  it seems like a great truck  And it works GREAT with both girls  carseats  so Brian is happy  Judging from my experience driving the   Ford Expedition    I would recommend it to anyone who has the need for a SUV br br
