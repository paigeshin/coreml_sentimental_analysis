 About a year and 1 2 ago my motor went in my 1990 Cavalier  So I started to look for a used car  I was looking for something a little sporty but reasonable to afford  Because my kids are older and have their own cars now I do not need the old fashion station wagons to cart them and their friends around in  I looked at many models and at many dealers  I found a few to be at my interest  After review loan and interest with banks I found that buying a brand new car my payment would be fairly close to the payment for a used car  I decided at that point to look at the 1999 Escorts  I went to the dealer and the model that was in the show room was an awesome color  very sporty looking  It didn t have all the option I was looking for so the dealing order up the parts and had the options added  I took it for a test drive and bought it  I never had a brand new car before so this was very exciting  I have it it for one year now and I love it  It has power locks  sunroof  rear spoiler  mag wheel and lots of power  I would just like you all to know before purchasing a used car and someone else s headache check into what it will cost you to buy a brand new one  It s well worth the feeling of owning a brand new one br br
