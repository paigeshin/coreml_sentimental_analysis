 I bought my sport trac in 2001 and have used it hard for two full years and this is what I think so far The best thing is that I m 6 2  tall and I fit in it comfortably  If that wasn t good enough  my brother is 6 5  and he has sat behind the driver seat and not griped  I can t find anyone who can top that The bed is short  but I like that  I tend no to haul a million tons of raw steel at any given time  but I do throw lots of camping equipment in the bed  or bicycles  or my mud covered dog and it works great  I purchased an aftermarket tonnau cover for the bed  the dealer one was too pricey  and I love it  The bed is extra deep and I rarely need to take the cover off of it The fact that I can fit five full grown adults and all their gear for a week long trip all into one vehicle is great  I have driven the truck through a dry  and not so dry  rocky creek bed to go caving deep in the woods of West Virginia and it has amazing ground clearance  This comes at a price though  my short wife has a little trouble getting in and out I got the rear wheel drive version only  and through a couple winters in Pennsylvania snow and ice  I wish I had gotten the 4 wheel drive instead  but at the time  the cost was too high for me The look is wonderful because I can take it out on the town and not feel like I m driving a pickup  but I can also take it home depot and not feel like the idiots putting plywood on the roof of their cavaliers  It s not overly tall like a land rover or a hummer  it s not overly long  so I can park in normal spaces in normal parking garages Finally  the back power window that goes up and down is great for extra long lumber and for the dog to stick it s head out the back  Now for negatives I should have gotten 4 wheel drive because of the outdoor activities I do in it and due to the snow and ice The turning radius is not so good The gas consumption is around 18 20 mpg  not bad for a truck  but not good for an suv When empty  just me driving it  it s a little bouncy  Since it is designed to haul loads  without them  the springs are a bit much  so sometimes control is an issue for the same reason
