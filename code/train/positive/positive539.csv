 Shooting Star Write Off  A charity in SW London is planning to build a hospice for terminally ill children  To publicize this  and to raise sponsorship from all mattygrove s drinking buddies  you are all invited to write a review that is SHOOTING STAR  or at least STAR  based   it could be on a book  a film or anything relevant  Perhaps you re a STAR Trek fan  or into astronomy  astrology  or Hollywood STARs the choice is endless   INTRO TO THE CAR OF THE STARS   JAY LENO AT LEAST b If you are familiar with my reviews  as you should be  you will recall that I once owned a 1991 Honda CRX with tinted windows  custom wheels  a killer stereo system that did obscene things to me via the vibrations of the base through my car seat  and sped up to 95 mph on Montana highways with a mere  5 dollar speeding ticket to show for it Ah  those were the days  After crashing my CRX several times and being put into the  high risk  bracket of car insurance  I decided to purchase a less sporty car  and made the horrible decision of buying a Dodge Colt in a shade of puke tan from a used car dealer in my neighborhood  After the lowered self esteem finally made me realize I simply must find something better  I gave the Colt to my roommate for Christmas  it could have gotten maybe  200 max if I sold it anyway  and withdrew some savings to purchase a 1991 Red Ford Festiva CUUUUUUUUUTE  Do you see the similarities here yet  My CRX was red  my Ford Festiva is red  My CRX was  cute  my Ford Festiva is  cute  My CRX had tinted windows and a killer stereo  my Ford Festiva is  cute  My CRX got me whistles and stares  my Ford Festiva is  cute  My CRX cornered so tight I could take a hairpin curve one handed  my Ford Festiva is  cute  And on and on it goes The Ford Festiva comes in the GL or L model  I for the life of me cannot tell the difference between the two  except perhaps for the rear window windshield wiper  The following technical stuff is taken from www cars com along with my notations in annoying ALL CAPS MPG  City Hwy  35 42   NOT BAD Wheelbase 90 2    TINY TIRES   CHEAPER  FOLKS Overall Length 140 5    QUIT LAUGHING Curb Weight 1 797 lbs    YES  EASILY LIFTED Cargo Capacity 11 7 cu  ft    PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ME Seating Capacity 4   NOT COMFORTABLY THOUGH Engine Size 1 3L   SMALL BUT MIGHTY Number of Cylinders 4   O K  NOT MUCH OOOMPH Horsepower 63  5000rpm   MORE LIKE PONY POWER Torque  lbs ft  73  3000rpm   I M CLUELESS HERE Brakes Power Disc Drum   I VE REPLACED TWICE  Air Conditioning   COSTS EXTRA  849 2 Wheel Front Drive   HANDLES WELL IN SNOW Sunroof  Manual   COSTS EXTRA  243 Defroster  Rear   COSTS EXTRA  160 Seatbelt  Driver Automatic   ANNOYING BUT SAFE  Seatbelts  Front Shoulder   ISN T THIS SAME AS ABOVE Wiper  Rear   EXTRA FOR GL  126 Radio  AM FM STD   EXTRA FOR GL  245  how tacky Steering  Power   COSTS EXTRA  250 Suspension  Strut Coil Spring   I M CLUELESS AGAIN Tires  P145 SR12 All Season SBR BSW   CUTE TINY TIRES Transmission  3 Speed Automatic   EXTRA  515 Transmission  5 Speed Manual OD   BUY THIS  NOT AUTO b Top 10 PROBLEMS with my 1991 Ford Festiva b 1  Exhaust system   I have had to replace my muffler twice 2  Brakes   I have had to replace my front brakes twice 3  Seatbelts   THERE WAS A RECALL on the front seatbelts 4  Seat Comfort   This car is not made for long road trips 5  Upholstery   Driver s side seat is tearing apart  vinyl 6  Other   fan belts have been replaced once  in 10 years 7  Slow acceleration speeds when merging 8  Blown around in a good  strong wind  Not kidding 9  Dings easily   pathetically easily on the sides 10 Horn sounds like a joke   people smile when I use it b Top 10 GOOD POINTS about the Ford Festiva b 1  Excellent gas mileage 2  Red Paint has held up very well   no rusting or chipping 3  Cute 4  Easy to park in ANY parking space downtown 5  For a single person  plenty of room 4 luggage  groceries 6  No electrical problems at all 7  Automatic seatbelts are annoying but insure you wear them 8  Small tires are inexpensive to replace 9  Cute 10 Reliable overall and a good commuter car b CONCLUSION  I would definitely recommend that you consider purchasing a 1991 Ford Festiva if you meet the following qualifications 1  You are single or a couple with no children 2  You need a reliable vehicle with good gas mileage 3  You need a car that is  2 500 or less 4  You want to drive the same kind of car Jay Leno of  The Tonight Show  owns and has souped up with a HUGE engine That s all folks   remember  the Ford Festiva is not a good road trip car because of the uncomfortable seats  but it is a great short trip car because of the great gas mileage Melissa Other write off entries tombarnes  counsel  petra  tigger1313  freak369  lattechick erocat  psychovant  naphtalia  artbyjude  xifphoid  badkittym  xiphoid  and mattygroves
