 Recently I bought a used  99 Ford Taurus  The model came with a V6 engine  power lumbar seat  cruise control  a nice package  For the 7 months that I ve been driving it  its been an extreme pleasure  The V6 engine gives the car a sporty feel and compliments the smooth steering and turning  And personally  I like my driving to be as easy and carefree as possibly  which the well set up cruise control aids me in greatly  While breaking  even slightly  I have noticed a slight twitch to the car  which can prove irritating at times  Although I m assuming this may have something to do with the fact that the car was used  Also  if you intend to install a CD player in the Taurus  think hard or think again  You ll have to pay  700  just for the CD player  no system  to get the custom designed Taurus CD player installed  You have no other options because of the interior design of the car  which is smooth and satisfying to the eye  but only allows for an odd shaped CD deck  Personally  I love the sleek  bold new look of the Taurus  I also know many people who think the looks are  quot weird quot  and  quot showy quot  The look of the Taurus was greatly changed in either  98 or  99 and I think a wonderful job was done  The trunk space was also increased  and I ve still yet to find a time when I actually need more space  Overall  I ve been greatly pleased with the reliability and performance of this vehicle  The gas mileage is mediocre  20 mpg on my count  and the room in the back seats is nice for a compact  The safety features are also very appealing to many  front dual airbags and anti lock braking system  These features plus many others managed to get the Taurus a double five star front crash test rating  the highest possible  A great car for a small family br br
