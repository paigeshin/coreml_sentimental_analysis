 This is my first Bronco  I ve always have had full size 4X4 pickups  I m really impressed with its handling and power  Mine has the 5 8L engine  I was only getting about 10 mpg around town and 14 on the highway  I increased this dramatically along with its power  by putting a K N fuel injection performance pack air filter  I also switched out the stock coil with a Crane  I put a 3 inch cat back exhaust  WOW  What a difference  I now get close to 16mpg around town  I even get 12 3 mpg average crawling around the rocks in 4 wheel drive  I took out the auto locking hubs and replaced with Warn locking hubs  It climbs with the best of the factory 4X4 s  Much roomier than my trucks and turns on a dime Happy You bet
