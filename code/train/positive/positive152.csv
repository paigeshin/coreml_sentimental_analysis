 Is it even possible for FORD to make a good auto  Hey it could happen  Model Info  2000 Ranger Edge Price Paid  20000 Strengths  Looks  4 0L engine  power  Edge styling  ride  great CD  Weaknesses   Interior doo dads   No map pocket on back of seats  no vanity mirror  no map lights  You must get the 6 the 2 5L cant pull anything  My dome light sensor makes the light stay on   Not after the hammer  They replaced it 3 times until my warranty ran out  Now I have no lights and a lil red light on my dash that always stays on  That has been the worst mechanical problem for me  I have replaced most Ford s OEM Air  fuel and suspension parts  They are to weak to have fun with  All I can say is I hate dealerships  I will never have another car of mine worked on at one  The people they hire are usless Compared To  Previously owned 1996 Ranger STX  Checked out Chevy S10  Toyota Tacoma  Nissan Frontier Review Summary  My former Ranger was rock solid and the new Edge is just as good  I custom ordered the Edge model  4x2  4 0L engine  automatic  extended cab  power equip group  6CD changer  I have had constant coments on the looks and no one can tell that it it NOT a 4x4  The Edge package is a little sparse on interior extras  but that is by design  I have plenty of room for my gear inside bikes in the back  great power acceleration  and the automatic is a must for Seattle traffic  Gas mileage is pretty good as well  20mpg right out of the gate  I love this truck and would recommend to anyone
