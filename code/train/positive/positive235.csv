 My 95 Ford Windstar at 90 000 miles has settled into a comfortable middle age  but it went through a lot of grief to get this far  An automatic transmission rebuild and head gasket replacement are the two major repair items so far  Anyone looking to buy a used 95 check to see if the head gasket on the 3 8 liter engine has been replaced  If not  keep on looking The Windstar is a quiet  comfortable vehicle with a good view of the road  The long wheelbase helps provide an absorbent ride  The Windstar is adequately powered at best  Gas mileage on our van has averaged 18 20 mpg  The cabin is comfortable up front  a bit claustrophobic in the rear  Didn t get the rear captain s chairs  but after riding a few hours in back recently  I wish we had  The rear seats are difficult to remove for hauling  but once they re out  you have a huge space for cargo  The rear seatbacks fold flat in an instant  an option I use a lot to haul my bike in the back  The Windstar meets our needs as a family of five very well  Now that it s paid for  we plan to run it into the ground br br
