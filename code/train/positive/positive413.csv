 I ve read all of the other reviews posted for the 2002 Expedition and I m amazed that most of the reviewers don t even own one  yet are compelled to write reviews that are nothing more than retyped spec sheets from Ford Take it from an actual owner   this is a great vehicle to drive  I have an Eddie Bauer 4WD version that I bought new in January 2002  It is so much fun to drive  I actually find myself looking for extra trips to make to the store just to drive it I ve had all the seats full of people  seats 8 comfortably and I ve had it filled with lumber and other cargo  Either way  it s 5 4L Triton V8 pulls it easily  In May  I used the tow hooks on the front to pull my brother s SUV  Olds Bravada  out of a swampy mess  Let me also tell you that at that time  his Bravada also had a 20  pontoon boat and trailer hitched up to it  It was up to it s axles in mud  yet the Expedition gracefully pulled it right out  without even breathing heavy at all  I then towed the boat about 40 miles over hilly country roads and often forgot that the boat was even there because it handled it so effortlessly Now  I don t plan on using it like that too often  but it was nice to know that it could handle it  My main objective with this vehicle to have comfortable seating for several passengers  I need more passenger room than I could get with smaller SUV s  so I only considered the Expedition and the Yukon Tahoe  I love GM products  but the Expedition costs about  5K less when similarly equipped  To those who suggest getting a mini van  I can only suggest that you quit making suggestions  This SUV  even if it never touches the off road environment  is the classiest and most comfortable way to travel  The added confidence of 4WD for winter driving makes any mini van just a glorified station wagon that is best suited for picking up groceries If you re reading this  you re probably already aware of the spec s for the Expedition so I won t retype them  What I will point out to you is that the Eddie Bauer is the only way to go  For about  4K more than an XLT  you get the 5 4L engine  leather interior  seat warmers  MACH audio system  digital temperature control  exterior trim package  very nice  and lot s more  I got mine with 18  chrome wheels and I have to say it s the only way to go One extra that was included on mine was the reverse sensing warning system  A  200 option  but worth lot s more  It has saved me on a couple of occasions by warning of obstructions behind me  and is a great companion for when I back the truck into the garage  yes  it just barely fits in my garage  I can easily back in and pull within 10 inches of the wall every time  just by listening to the beeping tones of the warning system  Make sure you get this option I m getting 13 1 mpg on a combined hwy city style of driving  Not so great on the wallet  but that is what you have to pay if you want a big SUV  It s no worse than any other large SUV  And the other issue about insurance costs   well  it s true that you ll be safe in an accident  but whatever you hit will likely be destroyed  But  isn t that the way you would want it  I know that I want my wife and new baby to be safe in case of an accident  so if it means an extra  100 for insurance  so be it  Your insurance costs are a direct reflection of your driving skills  so all of those reviewers that talk about high insurance costs must have some amazingly poor driving records  Of course it s going to cost them more if they re a bad driver behind the wheel of a bulldozer SUV like the Expedition  After you ve driven it for a week or two  you ll find that it s not very intimidating to drive after all  and the turning radius is really quite surprising To conclude  I will say that I love this SUV and will not part with it  Take it from someone who actually owns one  and disregard all those Pulitzer wannabees out there that have nothing better to do than write reviews about vehicles that they don t own  For 2003  Ford has added a new suspension that allows for the third seat to fold down flat  which is the only thing that I would love to change about my 2002  It would be so nice to be able to fold it s third seat out of the way instead of having to remove it and stash it in the garage before running to Home Depot I hope this review was helpful to you
