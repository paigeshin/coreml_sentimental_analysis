 Hot rod trucks are not a new form of radical transportation by any means  however Ford really is on the proverbial  ball  when it comes to this one  Add an intercooled supercharger to Ford s already potent Triton 5 4 liter overhead cam V8 engine  then drop it into a lowered F 150 with a dramatically stiffened suspension and huge disc brakes  and voila  you have the worlds coolest hot rod production truck  not to mention  at the time  the fastest i Driving Impressions i   A ny full sized pickup truck gives you that sense of power   most notably the 2002 Dodge Rams  towering over small passenger cars  In the case of the 1999 F 150 Lightning though  the feeling is enhanced  With 360 horsepower at your right foot coupled to a silky smooth 4 speed automatic transmission don t expect a boring ride  In terms of  acceleration   the 1999 Ford F 150 Lightning is astonishing  ripping 0 60 in under 6 seconds and to 100 mph in an estimated 15 2 seconds  according to many specs  Unlike most trucks where weight and poor aerodynamics come into play at around 80 or so MPH  the Lightning pulls far past that  Add flat  neutral cornering with excellent grip  responsive steering  and very supportive seats  and the mixture is just about perfect for a hot rod show truck   SVT    special vehicles team  selected the 5 4 liter Triton V8 offered in the F 150 and Expedition as the powerplant for the 1999 Lightning  Very good idea if you ask me  The 4 6 found in the Mustangs would have lacked Torque and power if they would have selected that particular engine  The Trition was conceived primarily to deliver a lot of low rev torque  440lb  ft  3 000 RPM  with a smaller bore than stroke of  3 60  x 4 22  Realizing that the Lightning buyers would want substantially more horsepower  some significant changes were made over its predecessor and its lesser models  The main power increase came by way of an intercooled Eaton Series II supercharger  also found the Jaguar XJR  The V8 got a special forged steel crankshaft  sinter forged alloy rods  and special dished alloy 8 4 1 compression pistons  A Larger 2 28  dual bore throttle body was also installed   Suspension b  The basic ladder type separate frame as used on all F 150s is retained for the Lightning  as is the basic suspension  short long arms up front and a leaf sprung live axle out back  Modifications include a lower height  recalibrated springs  modified shocks  thicker anti roll bars  and some massive  four wheel vented disc brakes i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the F 150 Lightning is very much like the regular F 150s  All Lightnings comes with split bench seats with center arm rests and storage bins  The steering wheel is thick and meaty  The stereo system in my test truck was not stock  it was a 6 speaker Alpine system  but from what I hear they came with  excellent sounding  stock sound systems  The gauge s are white  giving you that sporty feel while looking at your speedometer rise   same gauges that are in the SVT Mustang  These gauge s can be found in a number of Ford performance automobiles  There is plenty of room for 3 adults  and the seats are very supportive  and comfortable to boot  Like the regular F 150s for  99 model year  the Lightning is very  car like  in configuration  The drivers position is especially good allowing for easy access to the HVAC controls and all of the gadgetry in the cabin i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior   while not as bold as the 2002 Dodge Ram or any current generation Dodge Ram  is much more bold than the regular F 150s  There is no confusing a F 150 Lightning with a regular F 150  or any truck on this planet for that matter  The F 150 Lightning comes with side exhaust  a very cool feature  would have been better if it had dual side exhaust  A SVT badge of honor in the rear  Huge 18  rims matched with high performance tires  and an aggressive nose lets other drivers know this is one serious truck  All Ford Lightnings get the practical and convenient opening rear window  Red  black  or white  in all three of the available colors  the F 150 lightning radiates real aggression and style with its lowered stance and sexy five spoke alloy rims  and body extensions  Because of how collectible these trucks are  the  price  is actually higher then what they were back in 1999  I have seen F 150 Lightnings go for around  40 000  New  these trucks had a MSRP of around  30 000 even i Conclusion i While most owners will not utilize the power provided in the Lightning  the Ford Lightning offers amazing performance attributes  This vehicle may not be the best for off road use  in fact off road use is best avoided  however this type of a truck is one that will turn heads and burn rubber  fair enough trade off  The Lightning is recommended 100  to anyone looking for an exclusive  non off road  hot rod production truck Looking to read about another truck  You may want to check out    a href
