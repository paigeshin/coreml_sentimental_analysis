 We have been a Ford family for the past 30 years  And will not change  The previous F 250 Ford Truck we owned had 300 000 miles on the engine before we traded it in for another Ford and the only reason we traded it in was  that it was not a 4x4  We were Truck hunting at Van Boxtel Ford in Green Bay during an ice storm  We spotted the Black 4x4  in there lot  it was in A 1 condition  Unsure  whether or not we would purchase another at this time  because our truck ran perfectly  we were going to leave and let them know what our decision was the next day  Well low and behold we could not make it out of there lot because of the ice  So we backed down to the door and purchased the new vehicle  That was 8 years ago and now we are at the 300 000 mile on this engine and have not had any problems with it nor does it use oil  Gas mileage is at 20 gallon and we sure can t complain on the comfort of the drive  We use this vehicle not only for recreation but as a work vehicle also  Another way to make sure your engines last is to do regular maintance and always use the same brand of oil and the same brand oil filter
