 We purchased our Expedition after test driving both the Expedition and the Explorer  We are young with a growing family  so cabin space was very important to us  The Expedition had much more cabin space  with the ability to put three car seats across in the middle seat  With the Explorer  only one car seat would fit comfortably in the middle of the seat  We are very pleased that we purchased the Expedition which gives us ample room for traveling to haul all the extras  It also has a third seat which is nice when there are more than 5 passenger  It has a very nice ride and is very comfortable to ride in  The only draw back is the high cost of fueling the gas tank  If you have 2 or more kids and are looking for a sports utility vehicle I definitely recommend the Ford Expedition br br
