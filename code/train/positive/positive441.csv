 Recently I took the family on a 10 day trip to CA   In fact  we just got back today after a red eye flight  Why am I writing a review instead of sleeping  Waiting on laundry so I have something to wear to work tomorrow     For the duration of the trip we rented a  2001 Ford Taurus SES  4 door sedan that had about 2 000 miles on it when we picked it up b The road test  During the 10 day trip we put over 1 000 miles on the car  I drove about 95  of those miles  We went from the congested highways of the San Francisco Bay Area  to the wide open spaces of I 5 and the Central Valley  to the Sierra Nevadas and the twisty roads of Yosemite National Park  with side trips up to Sacramento and Sebastopol  Road conditions were always dry b Appearance  comfort  spaciousness  The appearance of the Taurus has improved greatly since the oval mania years  Of course  this improvement now means the car is average looking rather than ugly  It may not turn any heads  but it also won t appear dated in a few years  The car displays clean lines  conservative styling with a slight racy flair  Sporty wheels  rather than wheel covers  are a nice touch The driver s seat is comfortable and suitable for drives of several hours  It was easy for me to find a good driving position  though I m pretty average  5  11  average weight more or less  My wife had no complaints about the passenger seat and I thought it was fine during my short stint there  Backseat legroom appeared average  We had the 2 car seats in the back and only once stuffed someone in the back between them my mother   Lest you think I have it in for my mother  she just really hates riding in the front seat  Her main complaint was the hump in the middle of the floor   Why is that there in a front wheel drive car anyway Interior storage space is adequate  I m used to a minivan for our family travels so maybe I m a little bit spoiled when it comes to cupholders and places to throw things  The dash does not have built in cupholders  instead they are built into the cushions in the center seating position  If there is no center passenger in the front seat  the armrest is folded up and the center seat cushion flips around to reveal 2 cupholders and a general storage area  Now revealed on the floor under the armrest are coin holders  cassette tape storage  even though we didn t have a cassette player in our car  and more general storage space  The cup holders will hold most normal sized cups but will probably not hold Big Gulps or larger  There are two cup holders for the back seat that are also modestly sized Trunk space met our needs with no room to spare  We stored 7 bags in the trunk  from my wife s behemoth suitcase to a carry on sized bag  We were so tight that when we took my mother for a 2 night trip  I could fit her garment bag in the trunk but her small  carry on sized  bag had to ride with the passengers I don t have specs  speaker count  wattage  for the stereo system  In our car we had AM FM CD  with separate controls for bass  treble  balance  and fade  We picked up a couple of CDs when we discovered we had a player in the car  we didn t bring any of our own not expecting this feature  and they sounded like  well  CDs  The player did its job  no skipping on bumpy roads  AM FM reception was good  The stereo sounded clear and we enjoyed listening to it  both of our cars have premium sound systems so we re a little spoiled there too  It was loud enough to drown out the kids if necessary  Climate control was very good  I didn t get to use the heater  but the air conditioner works very well and doesn t seem to tax the engine at all  The front defroster clears the windshield in short order  Fan noise is average b Miscellaneous  The key fob has buttons for door lock  unlock  trunk open  and panic  honk horn  flash lights  There were no integrated child seats  The rear windows only roll down halfway  and the doors have child switches  which prevent the door from being opened from the inside  Child seat tether anchors are easily reached as they are on the rear shelf  There was some other mount at the base of the rear seat but I don t know what that was for  Rear defogger works quickly  Windshield washer fluid is dispensed in copious amounts so the windshield gets clean fast b Ride  handling  performance  Empty or loaded  the car rides very nicely  Even though from the outside the car appeared at full capacity  with a full trunk and full back seat  there was no noticeable change in the ride  Acceleration could be a little better  it takes a good mash of the accelerator to kick the car into passing gear and get moving  Overall  though  the power is more than enough  we zipped up mountains with all our stuff  air conditioner on  Through the winding mountain roads the car performed nicely  It took a little while to get a feel for the car  normally I drive a Mitsubishi Eclipse  but when I did I was able to safely navigate the turns at a decent rate of speed  fast enough to make my wife tell me to slow down at least no one rode our tail  On the flat  droning asphalt of I 5 the car tracked steady  largely unaffected by the wind or trucks  Cruise control works as advertised  though I didn t test it on hills I did not track gas mileage but fuel consumption appears average  given my lead foot  From the East Bay to our destination in Yosemite  a trip of about 200 miles  the car used less than 3 4 of a tank of gas  This drive consists of solid freeway traffic  high speed interstate driving  and a 6000 foot climb into the mountains  The car takes regular unleaded All in all this is very nice car to drive  I don t think I d call it  fun  but it makes driving as painless as possible
