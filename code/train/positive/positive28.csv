 I had a 1993 Escort Wagon  I owned this vehicle longer than any other vehicle before or since  I really liked this car  Believe it or not I was one of those people who swore that I would never own a station wagon  Then my first child came and the extra room just made sense  We could throw the stroller  diaper bag  portable playpen crib all in the back of the Escort for a trip to Grandma s house  This car was really nice to drive  The seats are comfortable  It handles well on the road  even in the snow  This car would normally be fairly inexpensive  It that were true in my case I would probably still have this car  Unfortunately I made some bad choices and ended up with a lot of negative equity  This car ended up with the brunt of the inequity and an extremely high interest rate to go with it  So as much as I loved this car  I hated the price I had to pay for it  I was lucky enough to find a car dealership that would help me rectify this situation and gave me a great deal on my last 2 vehicles   if you live in Western Washington check out Automotive Alternatives in Bremerton  they were great  I really liked this car  I can t think of anything bad about it  No costly repairs  no breakdowns  just routine service br br
