 A little backstory  In my family  we buy cars out of necessity  In this case  the 1989 Chevy Corsica had its last dance at the auto shop and was costing more than its utility  if on average I m spending more on repairs every month for the old car with no payments than I would on a newer car with the payments and higher insurance premiums  I ll dump the old one  Time to shop  We found a 1998 Ford Contour SE with 10 000 miles on it  Now  I knew of the horror stories about this car  the endless parade of recall notices and all of the repairs that follow  The guy who sold it to us  it was his father s before the he pasted away   and I think the family had more affection for this car than they did for the old man  had all of the service records showing that every recall  something like 8 or 9 of them  had been addressed and that the car was regularly serviced  I figured the rough patches in the car s history were over and that anything that could go wrong with the car already did  That was in March of 2000  For two years and 26 000 miles  or 36K miles on the car total  we have not had any problems beyond the usual wear and tear  Visits to the shop have been limited to routine maintenance  front end alignment and a new set of brakes and tires On the Powertrain Suspension  It s the SE w  the 2 0 liter  4 banger  Although the acceleration on the 4 cyl  w  auto trans  is relatively weak  it handles very well and the braking is superb  All Contours have independent suspensions and rack   pinion steering  My SE has the 15 in  alloys and 60 s all around  Put them all together and it s like I m glued to the road  A word about drivetrain choice  The 2 0 I4 w auto trans   overdrive lacks punch in the low end  I can t be too aggressive getting on the interstate or weaving through traffic  I ve had this type of engine in another car  Mazda 626 with a 5 speed manual  so I believe it s the tranny that s the problem  trouble translating those 125 horses to the tires quick enough  If I had my druthers  I would prefer the 2 5 liter 6 cylinder SE or the SVT  And  the combination of higher horsepower  195 horses in the SVT  and the road handling of the SE or SVT would surprise most BMW 3 series owners  On style and fit  The 1998 model look more like a shrunken Taurus  than the econo box Escort  Overall the Contour has very clean lines  even if it s a little generic  But  you can always tell the Contour from the rear end  though  The light cluster and combination of reflectors and chrome reminds me of the Lincoln Continental  just shrunken down  The seats are supportive and  overall  the interior design is very clean  The flip down seats in the back and the roomy trunk are big pluses  too  I ve got my roadside repair kit  golf clubs and diddy bag back there  but  I still have room to go grocery shopping or mall hopping        Side note  Okay  you re asking  what s a diddy bag   it s the backpack where I keep a change of clothes  shower stuff  and my golf shoes  I confess   I m a horrible golfer  but rarely pass on a chance to play  With that bag in the car  my answer to anyone who asks is always  sure   I ll play      Beyond being under powered  my only substantial complaint about the Contour is the interior noise  The cabin has poor sound insulation   road noise is excessive  Overall  Overall  the car is a real prince  It has a charming personality with just enough styling  comfort and handling  It s a shame they stopped making these little go getters in the US  Ford dumped the line and makes the Mondeo in Europe  the Jaguar X Type and the Mondeo are both cousins of the Contour  There are some notes about buying a used Contour  though  1  Take the SE or SVT over the GL or LX trim levels  The GL s and LX s that I ve seen  read about  and driven  seem chintzy inside and don t handle as well as either the SE or SVT  2  Get the 2 5 liter 6 cyl  over the 2 0 I4 if you can  You will be so much happier with the added power  3  Check the service records before you buy the Contour  or any used vehicle for that matter  If you re buying from a private person and they don t have the maintenance records or can t tell you where it was taken for service  be very careful  something ain t right  4  Get a warranty  If you re buying from a dealer  don t skip the extended warranty offer  And  if you re buying from a private person  check with the finance manager at your local Ford dealership  like the dealer that maintained the car for the previous owner  to see what they will do to put you into one  At a minimum  think about getting an engine and drivetrain warranty to cover you for as long as you re making payments on the car  you will thank me later  5  Be religious about vehicle maintenance  Fords tend to be very spiteful when you neglect them  In another year  I ll be getting a new car  We have the mini van  see 2000 Chevy Venture review  but we won t be getting rid of the Contour  My wife will take it back and forth to Annapolis and she insists that it will be the perfect car for our kids to have for their first vehicle when they get their driver s licenses  That s at least three years away  But so far  I can t say that I disagree with her
