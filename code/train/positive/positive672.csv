  What a pleasant surprise to have Ford build an affordable  cool  well sorted domestic pocket rocket and then to have so many bolt on performance parts available after only a year b To start out with the ZX3 has a racing history in the FIA World Rally Championship  WRC  Drivers Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz are trying to capture the manufacturers title this year  Anyway  your ZX3 likely did not get the Rally Option with the 230 hp motor  but you ll be pleased to learn that you can come real close to that with some carefully chosen bolt on goodies   disclaimer  these upgrades may invalidate your warranty   do your homework before modifying your new car b    Start with a K amp N air filter if you want to keep a stealth stock look  or you could opt for one of the umpteen gazillion cold air induction kits    Next you ll want an aftermarket exhaust to let everything breate a little easier  The one from http www focussport com has a great exhaust note and is relatively easy to put on  you will have to cut the stock exhaust off  however    Next go for an underdrive pulley which will free up a few horsepower   A performance chip is always an easy way to increase power   sometimes by as much as 20 hp    If you re really serious about more horsepower there are actually turbo kits available as well    Think about some nice cosmetic goodies also   a duck tail rally car style wing   check out  http www focaljet com  for group buys  There are also tons of ground effects kits from West Wings and others    Lower the car to improve the handling and appearance   try the coil overs if you can afford it  but just a solid set of lowering springs should do fine for all but the most serious competitior  try H amp Rs    WHEELS    some people use the  Contour SVT 16 quot  wheels  my personal favorite b  while others have used the Cougar 16 quot  wheels  both of these fit great since the bolt pattern is shared  There are also a ton of 17 quot  wheels that are fairly cheap that look great like the Konig Monsoon The sky is the limit from there  Check out the websites mentioned above for great tech articles also  What a great car and some great ways to improve it even more br br
