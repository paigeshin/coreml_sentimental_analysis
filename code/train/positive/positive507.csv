 Full Review Ford Taurus SEL 2002 NoBull  The Ford Taurus SEL Wagon 2002 is an example that a car manufacturer can put out a vehicle that will surpass government recommended safety standards and still be a very attractive and stylish automobile  Ever since a coworker bought a Taurus Wagon and rode in it  I always have been very impressed by this car  I thought that not only it looked very nice on the exterior but also that the interior was very practical  stylish and comfortable  Ford has equipped the 2002 Taurus with a series of safety features that makes it one of the safest cars on the road  Some of the safety features includes dual stage front air bags  crash severity sensor  safety belt pre tensioners  safety belt energy management retractors  safety belt usage sensors and driver seat position sensor  With all those innovative safety features it is no wonder that the US government has giving the Ford Taurus a Five Star Crash Test Rating  the highest mark a car can receive for crash test safety testing  The newly design cabin will give occupants an added two inches in rear seat headroom and a full inch in front seat headroom  The front seats are very comfortable even more on the driver side  which is equipped with a six way power driver s seat adjustment including a very good and appreciated manual lumbar adjustment  The interior of the car I drove had a very beautiful and stylish color combination  The seats and door panels were creme with medium dark grey dashboard and trims and the carpet was a light brown  the color scheme really looked smart and was very pleasing to the eyes  The Taurus Wagon can sit 8 passengers so claims Ford  but if you are thinking of 8 adults you will be stuffed in like sardines  Once you open up the fold down rear seats  you have no more room for cargo  I did feel that for a station wagon even with that rear seat down you had very little space for luggage and equipment  The exterior of 2002 Taurus Wagon has very beautiful lines and all its components are very proportionate to each other s  The color of the car I test drove was an eye catching Harvest Gold protected with a Metallic Clearcoat  One things I liked is how high the rear gate opens to allow you to load the cargo  this will definitely helps preventing people from banging their head on the rear gate  The 2002 Taurus Wagon is a real pleasure to drive either within city limits or on the high roads  I had the opportunity to drive it on an extended trip on one of upstate New York most scenic highway  The ride was excellent and the scenery was breathtaking  I really appreciated how well the Taurus wagon hugged the road and how comfortable you are it this car  The Taurus SEL Wagon comes equipped with 4 wheel disc brakes anti lock system and a new Electronic Brake Distribution system mounted on a Power adjustable brake and accelerator kit which makes it easy to find the proper way to adjust the pedals and seat to the driver s choice  N The Taurus SEL Wagon I drove was equipped with a V6 DOHC 24 valve  3 liters  The transmission is an electronic 4 speed automatic overdrive  It had a 4 wheel discs  anti lock system  The sitting capacity is for 8 passengers and the cargo volume is 82 cubic feet  Driving the Ford Taurus SEL Wagon was a real charm  I went for a drive on some of the most scenic roads in North America and what a sight with the Fall foliage turning from green to red  brown and gold and this beautiful gold automobile simply faded in with the natural decor
