 My family has been a Ford family for the past 40 years if not longer  My husband and I have just purchased a 2000 Ford expedition earlier this month  we are expanding our family and needed a bigger vehicle to fit our family and our belongings  The third seat in the back is a great idea it can be removed if we need the space or it can be used for extra passengers  It is so much more convenient then a compact car  We went from a dodge stratus to the expedition and in the car we could not have anyone ride with use so if we want to go some where with some one we would have to take at least two cars and that got pathetic  My mother has owned a expedition for 3 years now so we were not really getting into something new  She has had no problems with her expedition and we hope that we will have no problems either  This is a great car  truck  SUV  what ever you want to call it  it is comfortable to drive and easy to ride in so now I cant wait until our next long road trip br br
