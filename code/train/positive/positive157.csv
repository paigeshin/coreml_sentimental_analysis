 We own a 1998 Windstar  We and everyone else who rides in it  is completely impressed by how well it handles and how smooth the ride is  I really love this car  We got the basic model with very few extras  Still  it is a great car for the money  I didn t realize what an awesome vehicle it was until we were in a car accident  Another vehicle pulled into the drivers side of our vehicle  We were going 30  he was probably going 15 20  We were thrown off the road  and I was 4 months pregnant  Very scary  However  the Windstar shut off when we were hit  so we avoided a huge pine tree in front of us  Also  from the looks of the inside of the vehicle  I though no damage had been done  I calmed myself down  then got out  and saw that the entire drivers side of the van looked like it had been bent in half  It was unbelievable  The drivers seat and all passenger seat areas on that side were not affected AT ALL  I was very impressed and relieved  Neither of us had any physical injuries or problems  At that point I was sold on driving a Windstar for the rest of my life  We have put 60 000   miles on our Windstar in 2 years  We travel an awful lot  We have had ONE malfunction with the vehicle  Our transmission went  That is the only complaint I have about this vehicle  I am not sure if it went because of how much we use it or not  We have a theory that it could be related to the accident we were in  As a side note  we were told that is a good idea to have the transmission serviced sooner than the owners manual suggests  I love the way the vehicle is laid out  I like the cup holders  the little compartments  and the handle to help you get in and out  Also  there are tether strap holders for car seats on every possible location standard in the Windstar  In addition  my husband s brother  a 6 3 quot  basketball player has accompanied us on road trips  and he prefers the back bench  So I guess it is fairly roomy back there  We plan on buying another Windstar  when we do buy again
