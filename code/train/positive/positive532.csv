 I personally own one and I love it  Still the best selling sport utility on the planet  the Explorer rolls into  98 essentially unchanged from its 1995 redesign  although a number of details have been improved  including refinements to the Control Trac automatic 4WD system and  for  98  standard four wheel antilock brakes  An even more significant enhancement  added for the  97 model year  is the option of a new overhead cam 4 0 liter V6 engine and a five speed automatic transmission  The new V6 came along a little too late for our testing last year  so that was our prime focus for  98  and when the dust had settled we emerged with a strong respect for this new engine  With 205 horsepower and 245 ft lbs  of torque 45 hp and 20 more ft lbs  than the standard V6  a 4 0 liter pushrod design the new V6 delivers far better go and hauling power  a 5 800 pound towing capacity  versus 5 300 pounds  than the anemic base engine  Ford also offers a 5 0 liter V8 option  but the 4WD system that goes with the V8 does not include a low range feature  The Explorer s handling was no better than average in our track testing  marked by strong understeer and a slight tendency to lift the inside front wheel when pressed to its limits  On the other hand  its rack and pinion steering system is among the best  both in feel and precision  The same can be said for its braking  and the improved ABS reduces the unnerving pedal pulse and noise that still afflicts some antilock systems  As with the Durango  the four door Explorer s long wheelbase  111 5 inches  and limited ground clearance conspire to make it a marginal choice for tough off road conditions  If that s likely to be on your menu  the two door version is a better bet  with packages designed to enhance clearances and a much shorter  101 7 inches  wheelbase  The Explorer s strongest suit continues to be roominess  even though it s been upstaged a bit in this department by the Durango  The Explorer also has one of the most attractive interior designs of any sport utility  excellent seating  and  like most of its competition  a wide range of features and options  Some of the trim packages the Eddie Bauer and Limited versions  for example will send the price well over  30 000  But if you shop the option list judiciously  the Explorer is still a good buy  with or without 4WD  Our only major caveat  Avoid the base engine  Even though the base V6 is the only one offered with a manual transmission  the new overhead cam engine makes the going much more pleasant
