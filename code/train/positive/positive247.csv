 I purchased my Ranger new in March of 1996  I purchased it because I needed a truck to use while remodeling a home  but I wanted a vehicle that would be small enough to commute to work  I picked the Ranger over the other small trucks out there for a couple of reasons  First and foremost  the Ranger was rated at or near the top in most of the ratings categories in Consumer Reports  Second  in its price range  I felt that the Ranger offered more in terms of styling and options  The XLT package with sport wheels dress it up nicely  I have been more than pleased with my Ranger  It has 65 000 miles on it now and I haven t had a single repair  The 2 3 liter engine with the five speed manual transmission is sporty and fun to drive  I was originally worried that it would be under powered  but for light hauling and in most driving conditions the engine is more than adequate  The truck rides very well  smoother than small trucks I ve driven in the past  There are  however  some sacrifices made when purchasing a light truck  The room in the cab is tight and unless you have a camper shell  shopping can be a problem  My only regret is that did not invest in the extended cab model  Overall  I give my Ranger an excellent rating  I would highly recommend a Ranger to anyone considering the purchase of a small pick up
