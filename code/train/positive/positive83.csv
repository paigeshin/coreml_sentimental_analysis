  This is our nickname for our Ford Expedition  why you say  Because it is such a huge  beast of a truck We first purchased the Eddie Bauer version of the Ford Explorer  last summer  because I was rapidly outgrowing my Ford Explorer  With two kids  car seats  baby strollers and expensive makeup cases to haul around  we decided it was time to expand We had always wanted an Expedition and searched high and low until we found the exact one we were looking for   a black one with a sun roof  It s like a taste of freedom to open that roof and the closest thing I ll get to a convertible  We just needed more room for our family and this is the perfect vehicle if that s what you are looking for  too  It has a third seat in the back of the truck that can also fold down flat or you can remove it altogether Gripe 1  However  you must be very strong to both remove and or fold the seat down  I have found it impossible to do this as a woman weighing 112 pounds  My husband even has a hard time with the seat removal so a lot of the time we just keep it flat  My oldest son is six and he had so much fun riding in the third seat  but I found it to be unsafe back there  I am a big believer in booster seats for kids and that is not the place for him  And  once all three seats are up  there is almost no room for storage at all   Gripe 2  So now that you know how much I weigh  let me tell you how tall I am now  5 5  Why  you say  Well this is my problem with this vehicle Gripe  3  I am just too small to see behind me  especially when I am backing up  The front seats are high  bucket seats which I think are an obstacle  I am thoroughly convinced this is a MAN S truck and not made for women  even though I see more moms driving them  I even tried sitting on an elevated foam pad but that made it even more difficult Since purchasing this vehicle  the price of gasoline has gone up daily   Gripe 4  Can you say  GAS GUZZLER To fill up THE BEAST  It costs  40 00  at least  So part of the proceeds of this review will get me a gallon of gas If you live or work in a building with a parking garage  better check the height allowances   Gripe 5  because this bad boy needs clearance of 6 6  I ve scraped many a garage roof  And let s not forget about parking   Gripe 6  Parking spaces are meant for cars  not trucks  It is ALWAYS a tight squeeze to get into those spaces at the malls and once you get in to the spot  getting out of your car is a whole new issue  You must be thin as you try and squeeze yourself out between the cars  So what do I like about THE BEAST  you say  Three words  FOUR WHEEL DRIVE  LOVE IT  It has never let me down and that s worth it s weight in gold  I also feel very safe in this vehicle and absolutely hate riding in cars now  THE BEAST sits high and proud  and it s V8 engine can really take off All in all  this has been an excellent truck  very dependable and spacious  But I m thinking about trading it in for a slightly smaller truck  I have become convinced that it is not the most comfortable car to drive and it is just too big for me  I take a lot of flack from men that I work with about driving such a monster truck  Most of them are very envious of THE BEAST   everyone has something to say about it  It s kind of like BEAST envy  This is definitely a macho truck and well worth every penny So soon I may have to part with THE BEAST  parting will be such sweet sorrow  But  rest assured  my next one will also be black  four wheel drive and a sun roof  too  it just will have a girlier nick name  like  BEAUTY    hmmm The search is on anyone wanna buy a slightly used BEAST
