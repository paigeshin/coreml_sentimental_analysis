 We wanted a new car  We needed a new car  We wanted a new wagon  our 92 Taurus wagon was a loyal dog but a dog with fleas  It stunk like it was on its last leg We shopped  did internet research and the all important test drives and came up with the  Ford Focus Wagon  And what a deal   plus we got Ford Credit s 0  Financing deal  We pay no interest over 5 years   pretty good deal Here s the review  b Look    It looks great  If it didn t have the blue Ford oval on the front and rear  you wouldn t know it was a domestic let alone a Ford  The inside is a masterpiece  Great curves  great lines b Comfort    Unlike the old Escort models  even the ZX2  you don t feel like you are sitting on the pavement while in the car  What great seats   like sitting in your living room  I don t get numb butt when driving for over an hour like from other cars  Driver s seat has adjustable height as well  I like mine the whole way up b Function    Everything is right in front of you  If you ever claim you hit that car or ran that light because you were fooling with the radio or AC  the claims adjuster will know you are lying   because you re driving a Focus  Cup holders on the floor in the middle are great  Standard AC and CD player are cool  AC blows cool and powerful  Heat comes up quickly for those brisk winter days b Handling    Rounding curves or making 90 degree turns couldn t be more comfortable  What carmakers called European handling in the 80 s is here in this domestic car  The SE Wagon comes standard with the nice Zetec engine and has great pick up  What s more  the car doesn t rattle or feel like it s going to fall apart when doing 70 mph on the highway  You ll be speeding along at 75 and feel like you re going 35  Trust me on this point   it s incredible b Room    Ford says it has more room in the inside than any other car in its class  I haven t really investigated this  but I am a believer anyways  Two kids in car seats in the back haven t complained yet  and they used to be traveling in the Taurus wagon with that huge bench seat  Plenty of leg room up front  too b Gas    The sticker says it should get 25 mpg in the city and 34 on the highway  My guess is that s about right  with moderate driving work  supermarket  etc  we go thru a fillup once a week b Little things    The rear trunk pops up with the push of a button from the inside panel  Automatic windows and locks respond very nicely  It has stiff handling  which is a surprise from a Ford  You can haul a lot of stuff in this Wagon   we haven t suffered by moving down a class to midsize from the Taurus wagon  Inside dome lights have that fade out thing when you get out and shut the doors   nice  A nice security measure is this   when using the remote clicker  only driver side door opens with one push of the unlock button  The other doors unlock with two pushes of the unlock button  This is a nice comfort for those late nights in a strange parking lot b What it could use    It could use lit vanity mirrors for the driver and passenger  Ford put a lot of neat things in this car and this should ve been one of them  Also  there should be dome or reading lights available to the backseat passengers   my kids miss theirs from the Taurus wagon  It could also use those magazine pocket things on the back of the front seats so the kids can put their books and things in them   they miss them too b Finally    Buy it  you ll like it We got ours in White with the Tan interior   looks very sharp  We had mudguards put on as well  It really turns heads and people can t believe it s a Ford and when you test drive it  neither will you
