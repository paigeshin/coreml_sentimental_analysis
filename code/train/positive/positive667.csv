 If you are looking for a new car  for sure go with the Ford Mustang  I ve had my 97  cherry red ford mustang for a little over 31 2 years now and it s the best car i have ever owned  It gets great gas mileage  high speed  and of course it looks awesome  Only thing is  this is NOT a family car  The front seats give you plenty of leg room and you can be very comfortable  But  i must say the back seat area must of been designed for kids only  it s rather small and crampy  If you have young children who still use car seats this  is most likely not the car for you  I ve tried numerous times to fit a carseat in the backseat and still have the passenger in my car comfortable with enough room  needless to say it never worked out  What I love about this car  is that i have had basically NO problems with it whatsoever  Never had to take it to the shop  new tires put on  nothing  It s a very HIGH quality car  The car drives like a DREAM  I highly suggest it for anyone  Insurance can be a real pain in the rear end though  owning a mustang means outrageous insurance people  But  it s well worth every penny of it br br
