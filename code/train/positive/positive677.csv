 Ford has done it again  They have crammed a ton of engineering in a sport value package  I was extremely impressed by this car  From the outside it looks like a new edge design  nothing too special there  once you get in you know its something different  The interior is wonderfully laid out  The stereo is near perfect  the right touch  button size and distance from both passengers  The materials scream quality for  15000 like no other ford i ve been in  The interior material also has style  something I cant say for most value oriented cars  The seats are comfortable  the room  amazing  Im 6 1  250 and I could easy sit in any of the seats  the middle rear is a stretch  The steering wheel and shifter feel like they have been stolen off an a european sports sedan  The Zetec four  Ford should come clean  they must have stolen that off a japanese car  smooth  nice sound  good power  no way an American 4 cylinder  The suspension  wow  its fun to drive too  imagine that  Ford has really done it with this car  This segment is full of buzzing econoboxes  but this car stands apart  Numbers on its datasheet cant tell you about this car  You need to drive it to understand  Yea there are cars that can do all of these things better but not at this price  That is the key  For this amount of money its a true value  Ford put a lot of thought into the car  Safety  reliability  simplicity  performance  looks and VALUE  Great package Perfomance  For this segment its great  Acceleration  handing and steering are all top of the pack  The engine could be a bit more powerful but I will wait for a SVT version for that  A larger wheel tire package would be nice too Comfort  The seats are good  They arent volvo seats but for this size car they are comfortable for long trips and around town  They could use some more bolstering for spirited driving  Styling  Thats a personal opinion  I find the car attractive  not an attention getter but not too cute like the Beetle  The front end is nice but the rest of the car seems a little bland  Again this is not a very expensive car so I cant complain Safety  Almost All ford products  lets not get into tires here  have high crash ratings  The Focus  package is well put together and solid  Airbag equipment is present  Its brakes are good  Traction control option would be nice  added cost though
