 In June of 1998  a 1996 Ford F 150 XL was given to our family as a company vehicle  It was grey green two tone  with grey cloth interior and automatic transmission Inside the truck is a well designed and easy to use dash  Most knobs and dials are easy to find  and fit well in your hands  Most materials of are very high quality  However  the radio controls are awful  the buttons are too close together  and you have to take your eyes off the road just to turn it on  However  the radio and cassette player put out amazing sound quality  The speakers work well  and surround the whole truck cab with your choice of music  The bench seat does not give enough back support  You get a  quot sinking quot  feeling when you sit down  The air conditioner keeps you ice cold in the hottest weather  and in the dead of winter  the cab is red hot in only a matter of minutes  Outside  the whole truck looks great  The paint is average  but there are swirl marks all over after washing  and the alloy wheels  where equipped  corrode quickly  so one must keep them clean  The chrome wheels and bumpers  along with the two tone paint  really accent the exterior  The box is huge and can handle most loads  but the tailgate is too high and rather heavy  Loading the box requires 2 people The ride is bone jarring  You feel almost every vibration the road can throw at you  There is little wind and road noise  though  The V6 engine provides ample power and torque  but you get the feeling you re driving a family sedan instead of a pickup  The 4 speed automatic  with overdrive  transmission robs the engine of much needed power and shifts roughly  However  it handles curves responsively and with confidence  and parking is not a problem  You could steer this truck with your index finger  Surprisingly  this truck is a blast to drive  You can throw the F 150 any curve  and it inspires confidence every time Reliability is not a problem  The only problems I ve had with it so far is a broken driver s door lock  a cassette stuck in the cassette player  and a minor transmission repair  If you are looking for a truck to do basic hauling  moving  or just to run back and forth to the store  then the F 150 is the truck for you  It s tough  reliable  and fun to drive  It s a combination truck family sedan  and it s one great buy
