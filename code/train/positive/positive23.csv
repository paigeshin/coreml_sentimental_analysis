 We owned a 1993 aerostar for over six years  We bought it new and sold it in 1999 with 88 000 miles on it  We bought it because we were planning yearly vacation educational trips with children and friends and thought it would be an excellent vehicle for this purpose as well as serving as our family work vehicle  The aerostar met and far exceeded out greatest expectations  In fact  the present owners are still using it for trips to a hospital in a nearby city every week  It now has 120 000 miles on it  There is nothing to hate about this vehicle  The gas mileage was wonderful  There were no major mechanical problems during its entire stay with us  We did conduct regular maintenance  tire replacements  and so forth  The seating was most comfortable and convenient  Even middle aged ladies from our church enjoyed riding with us to church conferences across the country  No one minded if they had to ride in the middle or back accommodations  In fact  the option of removing the back seat from time to time proved a helpful asset when carrying luggage  groceries  or other items  Our family mechanic often stated that maintenance access was convenient for working purposes  The smooth ride  easy driving  and comfort of the vehicle are exceptional  If you are looking for a reliable vehicle that shelters people and possessions from the weather  that is easy to maintain  and easy to drive  then this aerostar is what you need to buy br br
