 I leased a  99 Ford Explorer Sport  2WD  2 years ago and have been very happy with it  I did a lot of research into SUV s before picking the Ford Explorer  The Toyota 4 Runner seems  overall  a better vehicle  but it is underpowered and sluggish in comparison  even the v6  very expensive  and does not come in the more economical 2 door Sport version that the Ford comes in  And the Jeep Cherokee  for the same money had none of the cool doo dads that came with the Explorer I opted for the fully loaded vehicle  It is very comfortable  has a fantastic sound system  and its SOHC engine has all the pickup I need  The compass temperature gauge rocks  and the tissue dispenser is indispensable  I have made several road trips with up to 4 people  and everyone was comfortable the entire time  Also  it s really easy to fold the back seats down for extra cargo space  One of my favorite things about the truck is its turn radius  It has an awesome turn radius  None of the other trucks I test drove could make such incredibly tight turns  But it does have some problems  Ever since I got the truck  the air bag warning light has been flashing erratically  Sometimes it stays on  sometimes it flashes  and sometimes it doesn t come on at all  The air bag warning light does frighten me  but according to the user s manual  there is a warning beep that will sound along with the light when there s a real problem with the air bag  I have had the truck serviced by Ford mechanics and another service shop as well  and neither garage could fix the problem  Also  for the first year I had the truck  whenever I would use my turn signals  the windshield wipers would turn on  this was good for a laugh but not much else  This weird bug was fixed by Ford mechanics  I would not recommend this 2WD vehicle for off roading  and it sucks in the snow  It handles dirt roads better than a sports car  but I wouldn t trust it in real hard core off road situations  Then there is  of course  the tire recall I have very little confidence in the electrical system of the truck  which makes me glad I leased it instead of buying  My doubts as to whether or not I will lease another Ford have more to do with Ford s eagerness to sell people death traps than with how much I ve enjoyed driving my truck  They re losing so much money from the Firestone recall though  they ll probably have to offer really good deals  I probably will lease another Ford Explorer Sport  but I will not buy one  and I will make damn sure I m not being sold recalled tires  I wouldn t put it past them to try br br
