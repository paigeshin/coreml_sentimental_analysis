 Well  I have had my 2000 Taurus for about 4 000 miles now and would recommend it to anyone  The new design is much more eye appealing and the 200 hp Duratec V6 adds plenty of punch for a mid sized sedan I looked at the Intrepid  Impala and the Taurus  The Intrepid was also great but I opted to steer clear of Chrysler after being poorly treated by several Chrysler dealers in my area   The product was very good though  The Impala was also good but very pricey in comparison and I was concerned with the new model design ot being proven Back to the Taurus  I purchased the SEL model which has almost everything except a moonroof  The engine is smooth and quiet  it shifts great and handles good for such a heavy car   I believe it s the heaviest car in it s class  The ride is smooth as silk  and shifts are hardly noticeable  It has great passing power in the 50 70 mph range ABS works great as I found out right after I purchased it  The traction control is also great on slick roads  no snow test yet  However  both of these features are pretty noisy when the kick in  which is not unusual  The steering is also very responsive and again  it handles well for a heavy car  The one thing I could not figure out is why it does not have 4 wheel disc brakes  The rears are drums  Come on Ford get with the program I have been averaging about 22 25 mpg on a 50 50 mix of highway city driving  Leather interior is nice  seats could use a little more side support  As for the interior  the design is very conservative compared to its competitors  Very basic but functional controls  It s not as fancy as the Intrepid or Camry or any other of its competitors I also have the Mach stereo system as the car on the lot I chose had it already installed  I would not recommend this system  I believe it was a  675 option  You could do much better at your local car stereo shop for the same price  It s not horrible but for the money there is better out there  The six disc changer is nice even though it s located in the trunk   Ford should take a lesson from Chrysler with the four disc in dash CD  much more convenient The Taurus has a lot of great saftey features to go with its 5 star crash test rating  a big factor as I begin to start a family  Front and side airbags  ABS  fuel pump shut off to prevent fire  glow in the dark drunk release in case a child gets locked in the trunk I also have the keypad entry which is a cool feature although I have yet to use it  The heated mirrors will also prove to be useful when old man winter comes a knockin  Automatic headlights are great although they do not go on automatically when you put on the windshield wipers  many states require you have your lights on when you use your wipers  The trunk is huge and the rear seats fold down The climate control is great and I have actually received several favorable comments on how fast the A C kicks in even on 90 degree days  Have not used the heater yet  Front and rear defoggers work very well If you can live with the plain interior this car should be at the top of your list  I believe the 2000 model is back as the number one seller in its category this year but I m not positive br br
