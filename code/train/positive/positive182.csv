 My Ford Thunderbird was the first car I ever bought on my own  I test drove it straight to the bank  I bought it used in June of 1999  The seats wrapped around me like a glove  the car looked great  drove great  When I bought it  it had 70 000 miles on it  perfect interior  few scratches  This was luxury for me  It had automatic driver s seat  wonderful interior lighting  and rode like a dream  I also have a child  who rode in a car seat at the time  and i never had trouble getting her in or out  I never had any trouble out of it  other than the transmission needing a rebuild in August of 2000  I absolutely loved this car  There wasn t a thing I didn t like about it  At very high speeds NO  my daughter was not with me instead of shaking or floating  it felt like the car sat down and hugged every curve  My husband routinely drove it to his fire and rescue calls because it was faster and easier to handle than his truck  I  being stupid  decided that I  had  to have a truck  and a brand new one  at that  So  I traded it in October  2000  Trust me  I would kill for another one  maybe a super coupe this time  I ended up giving back the new truck that I had to have because I couldn t afford the payments anymore  I am still kicking myself  because my T bird would have been paid off in July of this year
