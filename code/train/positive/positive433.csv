 To start off  I d like to state that I m the proud owner of a brand new Sport Trac  I spent a long time researching the available cars  and this turned out to be the right one for me  I found that almost all my initial concerns were incorrect  and a couple innovative features took me by surprise b EXTERIOR  9 5  This is one of the biggest head turners I ve ever seen  And it isn t just the strange hybrid that causes it  This car has character  It has the aggressive front end style that Ford is putting on the 2002 Explorer  It s got a sturdy  rugged roof rack  It has exterior tie down hooks running the length of the bed  Even the tailgate is different from anything else  with the Ford logo embossed proudly in the center  Prepare for plenty of questions from onlookers in parking lots and at intersections   b INTERIOR  10  The interior is the part I love  When people get in this car  they expect a simple  trucklike look  While the Sport Trac has rubber floors and water resistant seats  it s no truck  A great CD stereo system  white faced speedometer  comfortable bucket seats  power rear window  and more leg room than a regular Explorer  If the stereo is on too loud when you turn it off  it automatically sets it to a reasonable volume when you start the car up again  Keyless entry  remote entry  illuminated entry  the list goes on  The plastic texture on the dash isn t great  but other than that it s a beauty  Since there s no huge empty cargo area in the back  the air conditioner and stereo work very well  The only feature I don t like on my Sport Trac is the rear floor console  It allows people in the back to choose what music to listen to  The problem is that there s no way for the driver to override it b ENGINE  7  The Sport Trac engine can tow up to 5000 lbs  However  it suffers from very poor acceleration  If you want this car to move  you have to hit the pedal to the floor  This will come as a shock even to those who frequently drive other SUVs b RIDE  9  Very quiet  comfortable ride  The engine is almost silent  and road noise is kept to an absolute minimum at most speeds  Ford did a great job in stiffening the Explorer frame  It makes the ride very enjoyable  and a far cry from other trucks you might encounter b HANDLING  10  Incredible handling  Very tight turning  with wheels planted at all speeds I tested  Emergency maneuvers are able to be completed with no problem  For instance  an idiot car pulled out of a parking lot right in front me  and I was able to swerve and avoid it easily   RELIABILITY  N A  Ford claims that no maintenance will be required  but I m not absolutely sure  Unfortunately  the car is too new for me to give an accurate review  However  I will say that Ford has done a good job by marking the engine spots you would most likely need to access with bright yellow paint  They also have a roadside assistance warranty for any unexpected problems you might encounter b VALUE  8  Very cool car in almost every respect  Unfortunately  it is also very pricey  My model ran  27000 and I didn t bother with leather  6cd changer  tonneau cover  or many of the other available features  However  I am very pleased with it so far and would definitely recommend it b Initial concerns b  Not enough space for groceries or other common items  Poor acceleration  Simple interior  Cramped seats  Huge size  Bad ride b New realizations b  Plenty of room when seats are down  Poor acceleration    Wonderful gadget filled interior  Comfortable seats  A little bit long  but not too wide  Carlike ride b CONCLUSION  If you don t need to use an enclosed cargo area every day and occasionally carry something dirty or wet  this is definitely the car for you  It s great for scuba diving  and I m sure many other sports would benefit from it as well  The back is sturdy but light  the cabin is rugged but elegant  this is truly a hybrid br br
