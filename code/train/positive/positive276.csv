 Working for the rescue squad in my city  I occasionally get the chance to drive a Ford Crown Victoria  We use them as chase cars  basically  but we call them zone cars  When an ambulance responds to a scene  a paramedic can chase the ambulance or beat the ambulance to the scene using one of these cars  Response time for paramedics is much more efficient this way  It keeps us extremely mobile  First I need to comment on the handling of these cars  There are plenty of other vehicles out there which would have worked just fine for the job we use the vehicles for  but I can see why the city chose to use these above all others  They handle like a dream  They have a very tight grip on the road  and the steering is not lose at all and has little to no play in it  unlike the majority of Ford built vehicles  The seats  in addition to this  are designed deep in an effort to keep you in place while going around curves  All of these factors take a big role when you are traveling at 90mph through rush hour traffic with lights and sirens at full blast  With that said  we are glad they have airbags as well  Next on the list  the power  I m not sure what size engines these cars are normally sold with  it could be the same size we have  or it might not  The ones we use sport a 4 6L V8  I could be wrong though  because they may just very well be sold to the general public the same way they are to us  minus the white paint  reflective stripe down the sides that say rescue  and the red and white strobe light bar on top  Considering the size engine they have in them  I have noticed that they still have excellent gas mileage  It usually ranges from 20 to 21 miles per gallon  This may not seem like much  but just think of how many times we gun the engine with these cars everyday  Also keep in mind that they are usually left running all the time at scenes  For an added bonus  in case most people don t know  strobe lights  sirens  a computer  and several radios draw a lot of power from that hard working alternator  and to make up for it the city sets the engines to run at a high idle  Even after all this abuse they can still conserve a considerable amount of gas  Now for the room in the vehicle  They have a very large amount of space  We can carry everything an ambulance has on board  with the exception of the stretcher  and still have plenty of room for a couple of passengers  Most of the equipment will fit in the trunk  if not all of it if you position it right  Along with tools  a jack  and the spare tire  The space in the front is very good as well  Located up there is a clipboard  many map books  a mounted computer  several radios  the control panel for the lights and sirens  and yes  still room for passengers  I think these cars are very comfortable   I have to drive them constantly around the city for 12 hours at a time  and by the end of the day  other than being tired of working  I still feel just as comfortable as I did when I first got into the car  A direct quote given to me from one of the people that spends much of their duty time in a zone car  The city garage maintains the cars  however we still get the chance to see what repairs have been made  if any  They go into the city garage once a month for preventative maintenance  and for the most part  all we have seen done on these cars is fluid changes  engine cleaning  and adjusting the alignment  balance  rotation  and changing tires  I can say that the tires seem to get worn more often than a lot of other cars  but once again  look how we drive these cars  and besides  a different tire brand could help that  but our city is pretty stubborn  Once in a great while something other than that will have to be repaired  but what car does that not happen on  If you can find one  let me know because I am going to own one soon  Generally speaking  as much as these cars get beat up every day  I am amazed at their ability to stay in great working condition  One owned as a private vehicle would work positive wonders on your maintenance bill  These cars are built very solid  They can absorb much force in a collision  They are designed to do just that  absorb most of the impact and protect the driver  Loaded down with brake and sudden motion activated seat belts  dual airbags  shatterless windows  and a crumbling body  they can be trusted to get you to where you need to be safely  They even have a very sturdy roof  If you re wondering where I became familiar of how well the car protects the driver  they have been rolled  wrapped around poles  had head on collisions  been T boned  rear ended  etc  etc  and drivers walked away from all of it with nothing more than seatbelt sores  airbag abrasions  and a bruised ego  statement based on info gathered from sources in this rescue squad  as well as the local police departments  I have yet to wreck one  and I hope I don t
