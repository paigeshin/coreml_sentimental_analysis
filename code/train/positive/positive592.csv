 Due to a combination of circumstances with which I will not bore my busy audience  it was recently necessary that I make a trip from Boston  MA to Atlanta  GA and back  a journey of some 1000 odd miles each way  Due to the amount of luggage that needed to make the trip as well  flying was prohibitively expensive  and due to that same quantity of luggage none of the cars owned by the four parties involved were large enough  so the decision was made to rent a minivan  The automobile chosen was the 2001 Ford Windstar  and having now spent a total of 34  hours driving and riding in the vehicle through sun  rain and fog at all hours of the day and night  I have prepared a brief sketch detailing my thoughts  After all  I might as well have something to show for my absence from epinions  right As a passenger I must first note that I found the rear seats  which are pretty comfortable for basic sitting  a little firm  but not unpleasantly so  to be almost impossible to sleep on  Since we were taking turns with the driving and going straight through a 14 hour trip after not having slept a whole lot the night before  this distance is from CT to Atlanta we rested after the three hour trip from Boston to CT  it would have been very helpful if the drivers to be could have gotten some sleep while waiting for their shifts  but this was extremely difficult  This is partly due to the fact that the back seats are bucket seats and are placed about six inches away from the inside wall of the car normally I like to lean against the door with a pillow to sleep in a vehicle  but this was impossible in the Windstar  This may seem minor  but I considered it a serious flaw due to the situation  on the return trip we left at 9 30 pm and drove all night  so comfortable seats for sleeping would definitely have been helpful For those who do not anticipate spending a lot of time sleeping in the back seat this may not be much of an issue  but if you are ever considering renting one for a trip  as we did  I would say that this factor definitely warrants consideration as all four of us had a lot of trouble getting any rest while on the road  The front seat  which is set against the door in the usual manner  was a little better for sleeping  but it still proved hard to find a good position  The firm seats don t really yield well to any position other than sitting upright  so any sort of slouching or leaning in an attempt to nod off is not welcomed by the car I should note that the vehicle has a removable second back seat which is a bench seat we rented it without this to leave more room for the cargo  but that one may well be more comfortable for napping than the two rear bucket seats we had The front seats are easily adjustable to a wide range of angles handy since three people of varying heights were taking turns at driving and the rear seats recline pretty far back  although  not to belabor a point  this somehow did not prove helpful when it came to sleeping As a passenger in the back seat I also noticed that it swayed quite a bit in the rear  I could often feel it lurching a little from side to side due to wind  swerves  etc  but this was barely noticeable in the front seats and did not seem to affect the vehicle s handling I drove the Windstar for the most part on highways  The little city driving I did was unremarkable I mostly noticed that I was more uncomfortable with the vehicle in town because with more other cars closer to me the size of it became more noticeable and I am not used to driving a large car  but it handled smoothly and braked well  I am always interested in brakes  and since I managed not to sideswipe anyone I consider the adventure a success Out on the highway it took a little while to get up to cruising speed  probably about average pickup for a large vehicle  although I don t have much to compare it with  and lost a little speed when going up hills  but when cruising on a flat road it performed admirably  There was no noticeable difference in feel between 50 and 80 mph  and occasionally and briefly up to 95  the ride stayed smooth and the noise level  it was always a little loud  but conversation was still possible between front and back seats with a little raising of the voice  remained the same  This was sometimes a bit of a problem when I would glance down and notice that I was going 85 without meaning to  but once I learned to keep a close eye on the speedometer I could only admire the smooth way it handled high speeds  It is also equipped with cruise control  so if you like to use it this would also have solved that problem Personally I prefer to moderate speed manually  but I also prefer standard transmission  just a control freak  I guess  The Windstar  of course  is an automatic  and I can report that transmission was smooth and quiet It does take rather wide turns  and turning feels a little tricky at high speeds  but then  no matter what you re driving you should be careful around turns at 80 mph  but otherwise the handling at highway speeds was very nice  I did find that I had a tendency to drift a little to the right  although this may be my own fault rather than anything to do with the car  and there is a marked blind spot on the right side  but the car was always responsive and I never felt in danger of losing control This remained true even in pouring rain  Aside from sometimes speeding like a maniac  I am a cautious driver and tend to be wary of wet roads  but I felt firmly in control of the Windstar  after reducing speed a little to about 60 mph  even in the middle of a downpour Changing lanes was a little nerve wracking at first when moving to the left since the side of the vehicle is so long  but once you get used to it there should be no problem  Likewise  backing up was a challenge since I wasn t used to looking through such a long interior to the rear window  and parking was interesting  but these are all issues that would quickly be resolved if I had time to get really accustomed to driving a larger vehicle We had to refuel 6 times during the trip  including once to fill the tank before returning the car to the rental agency  We spent about  25 30 each time  and concluded that we got decent gas mileage for a large vehicle Cargo space  without the third row of seats  was pretty much exactly adequate for our needs  We were carrying two large cardboard boxes  five backpack sized bags of personal effects  several smaller bags of snacks and odds and ends  a video camera  a microphone case  a couple of poster tubes and some lumber  This filled up all the space with little room left over  but did not take up enough room to interfere with vision through the rear window  I would estimate that the size would be adequate for most general moving needs There are also many nice little nooks and crannies to store things elsewhere in the van  including little cubbies between both front and rear seats  a CD holder up front  a coin holder on the ceiling  etc  The cup holders in front were a little flimsy looking  but did the job  Cup holders in back were more solid and were a nice touch since we jointly consumed about 30 bottles of water and soda on the journey  We were also entertained by a little fold out mirror that allows people in the front to keep an eye on the back seats  We didn t have a whole lot of use for it  but it would probably be handy for those with lively  squirming children I should mention that this vehicle has a sliding door on each side providing access to the back seats  rather than the usual right side only door  This is a major selling point for Ford  I think  and I can report that it was indeed very handy not to have anyone having to climb over seats to get inside  We also liked the fact that the child safety lock feature  which prevents the side doors from being opened from the inside  was easy to turn off  just flip a lever on the edge of the sliding door once it s open The controls were fairly standard  lights on a dial  turn signal and windshield wipers on a lever on the steering column  emergency brake below  etc  The gear shift is on the steering column  which some people like and some don t  Personally I don t have a strong preference either way as long as it gets the job done  which this did There were no aspects of the controls that we found to be odd or hard to get used to in the short time we were driving the vehicle We had slight problems with the temperature  but only because I am always cold and everyone else in the car was always hot  Mechanically  the climate control worked just fine  There is even a separate control dial to give a different temperature for the back than the front  We didn t really do a stringent test of this function  since everyone but me was agreed on a cool temperature  but at one point we did try warming the back for those people trying to sleep while keeping the front cool to maintain alertness in the driver  and it seemed to work I obviously cannot speak to any issues that might arise as the vehicle gets to be a few years older  We had no mechanical problems  but it would have been surprising if we had  since the car was practically brand new and rented to boot  and there could be age related problems down the line that we will never know about I cannot give a recommendation on whether to buy or not buy based on my experience  but I can offer advice to anyone considering renting a vehicle to haul a bunch of stuff or several people  That advice would be  go for it if you re not planning to need sleep  but if you re going to be in it for the long haul I would seriously suggest looking for something with more comfortable seats  I would give the Windstar 4 stars in general for speediness  control  carrying capacity and gas mileage  but due to the unpleasant experience with the seats I can only give it three  Again  this may seem a small issue  but all four of us agreed that the inability to sleep in the seats was a problem on the long drive  and I personally would think twice before renting another Windstar for any extensive trip Otherwise  I have no fault to find with the vehicle  which performed admirably in the few days we had it And since I can think of no more to say  here ends my song of the rented Windstar
