 I m not exactly an unbiased author  I ve owned a corral of late model performance Mustangs that include a 1991 LX 5 0L  1993 Mustang COBRA  and a 1998 GT 4 6L  for my wife  I recently purchased a 2000 Performance Red GT  is there really ANY other color  to replace the  91 upon its mechanical demise  I researched the 2000 thoroughly and quickly discovered that its entry level invoice price was below all the other American vehicles of comparable size that offer styling or performance to match  such as the Camaro Z28  Pontiac Firebird  Pontiac Grand Am  Pontiac Gran Prix GTP   amp  Chevy Monte Carlo  Even factoring in a fully optioned GT  the price remained about  1500 below comparable models  When you see the  25k price on my Epinion  keep in mind that it is  25k out the door with every option available  My 2000 is a GT coupe with leather  auto  17 quot  wheels  and the Mach 460 sound system  Those are option packages provide all the extra stuff included with the option package price  the GT package gives you all the mechanical  amp  performance stuff to go along with the 4 6L  the leather group provides all the electrically adjustable seat controls  just for the driver  though  the 17 quot  wheel option gives you the bigger tires  amp  wheel locks  and the 460 package gives you all the extra speakers and cool stereo with CD  Virtually all Mustangs come with the  quot Power Equipment Group quot  which gives you the power locks  windows  steering  brakes   amp  mirrors  There s another  quot Convenience Group quot  which comes on virtually every Mustang which provides front mats  air conditioning  and rear defroster  The GT option also provides 2 new  since the 1999 2000 models  features for the Mustang  ABS  amp  Electronic Traction Control  The ABS is what you d expect  The ETC is a system that senses rear wheel spin on acceleration  now how would THAT happen  and uses the ABS system to apply the brakes to the spinning wheel and uses the Electronic Engine Control system to temporarily  quot de tune quot  the engine to stop it from revving up until the wheel stops spinning  It s definitely weird to experience the ETC system at work  but I guess it s a good thing  thank goodness it has an  quot off quot  switch  though  So   25k is about all you can spend on a well equipped coupe  the convertibles  amp  Cobras would require more money  I may have forgotten to purchase the lighted vanity mirrors  but if my wife can live without  em  so can I   that s got a genderist tone  doesn t it How s the performance  I was skeptical about the 4 6L s ability to carry on the Mustang s mystique and performance image  but I am consistently impressed  I am certainly no stranger to the push rod performance of the 5 0L  and though the 4 6L is considerably different in its personality  smoother  amp  silkier  its performance is every bit as respectable as its predecessor  Some people may dislike the 4 6 s decided lack of harshness typically associated with old school pushrod engines  but time marches on and the 4 6L will definitely win you over  As far as the modification potential of the 4 6L goes  I can t say as I am a bit of a lightweight there and usually stick to stock  Styling  In Performance Red  the heads turn  The 1999 2000 is a bit bulkier  amp  angular and more likely to appeal to the men  sorry if that s genderist  I didn t mean to be  but it definitely looks great from any angle  Exterior styling is always a matter of personal taste  so glance at a picture and see what you think  the car does seems to look better with more time spent looking at it The interior is a carry over with subtle refinements from the 1994 re style  It is modern without being quirky and very functional  Comfort abounds  and I really don t have any criticisms  You can visit one of those online car buying services  like carOrder com  and take their  quot 360  interior view quot  virtual tour for the Mustang  and what you see there is pretty much what you get  no surprises  From my vantage point  it is unchanged from my wife s  98  Interesting side note  Ford may be saving money by making leather available on only the front seating surfaces now  my  91 had 4 seat leather  And no option package has rear floor mats  so be prepared to shell out an additional  19 00 for them  Not a deal killer  but irritating  Other irritants  mild  for the interior include the lack of glove box light  I m nitpicking here  and the seat belt loops attached to the seat backs must go  I removed mine and I hope I can do that without compromising the safety or operation of the belts  Well  maybe now my forehead bruises from reaching into the back seats and banging into those stupid loops will heal  The rear seat back fold down trunk entry feature is a real plus  I guess I m getting older because I care about the stereo in a sports car  the Mustang s Mach 460 system is heaven  no complaints here  All in all  the interior is a comfortable  thoughtful  and handsome package irritants aside  Another interesting side note  for the money  the late model Mustang has always provided FULL analog instrumentation included in the base cost  That instrumentation includes a speedo  duh  a tachometer  temperature gauge  oil pressure gauge  fuel level gauge  duh again  and ammeter  All of this is presented in an attractive and properly placed cluster that avoids all of that stupid gimmickery that plagues less thoughtful vehicles  No digital stuff  excluding the odometer  that will burn out  blink  and stop working  No overly large speedo  temp  and fuel level gauges that are large in order to hide the fact that all 673 000 engine sensors are wired into a single  quot service engine soon quot   ok  I m GM bashing sorry  light  With the Mustang s gauge cluster  you can monitor the  quot traditional quot  engine conditions without worrying about a catastrophe coming without any warning  Hey  FINALLY the Mustang has a  quot low fuel quot  light Side view visibility is awesome now thanks to the revised roof line shape and the quarter window placement  That was a real hazard in the 1979 93 hatchback models  Speaking of hatchback models  I remain curious if I will eventually miss the convenience of the hatchback configuration  I think I will  The trunk access of the post 1993 models is not very good when put to the  quot luggage test quot  Perpetual  quot jockeying quot  of luggage items while half in and half out of the trunk is always necessary to get them in all the way  There s a low ceiling to the rear trunk area due to what I think is the rear speaker assembly  So  when you imagine you can shove tall items to the rear  you usually have to break out  quot Plan B quot  I would ve considered a hatchback model again if offered in a structurally rigid platform  The structural integrity of the post 1993 models is excellent and maybe maintaining that integrity was at least a partial concern in not making a hatchback  My  91 was a hatchback and never quite had that  quot new car quiet quot  feeling due to very small rattles that became not so small as time wore on  Speaking of rattles  there seemed to be numerous  amp  negative comments on the fit and finish of late model Mustangs  and I was curious as to whether I would be impressed or not with the assembly quality of my 2000  Well  suffice it to say that the comments seem to be warranted as far as my wife s  98 goes  Body seams are visually off  some of that may be due to what is ridiculously complicated styling in some areas  like the rear face  Her outer side support cushion on the driver s seat is breaking down  and there are some interior finishing strips that aren t adhered well  The car has 50k miles and is exactly 2 years old now  so maybe some of that is to be expected  I maybe thought Ford would ve come further since my  91  which shared some of that charming shoddiness  But the  91 was a  16 000 car  not a  23 000 one  Oh no  now I ll get all those economist emails reminding me to adjust for inflation or the GNP  You get the picture  though  My 2000 seems much tighter and quieter  and the body seams are excellent  So  maybe improvement has been achieved in that department Let s go driving  The 5 0L has a 4800 RPM  approximately  redline and the 4 6L has a 6000 RPM redline  That fact alone illustrates the difference in their personalities  The 5 0L launches off the line brutishly and pulls like a freight train while revving below 4500 RPM  The 4 6L has a constant pull that isn t quite as strong  but goes on and on  steady and strong  until 6000 RPM  So  the new ones take a little getting used to in the way of letting them rev up  Besides  there s nothing like hearing a V 8  even a small displacement one  smoothly rev up that high  The 2000 s exhaust note is awesome and a little lower than the  98 s  It has that great  quot throaty quot  quality and sounds very much like the 5 0L at idle  My muffler technician described the 5 0 Mustang exhaust as   quot one of the best looking  best sounding stock exhaust systems out there quot  The 4 6 s is just as satisfying  It combines the great throaty quality of V 8s with the loud growl of small displacement engines into a purely intimidating  and obnoxious  note  Great looking pipes  too  That s important  I m not GM bashing here  but is anyone at the company LOOKING at the exhaust pipes when they re designing the cars Handling is excellent as expected  The structural rigidity does wonders for enhancing the ride and the control  The 1979 93 models required you to do all the rigidity work yourself in order to get that kind of integrity  After doing all that reinforcement type of work  your car  well  mine at least  finally had that flat cornering   quot ride on rails quot  feeling  The new ones inspire that kind of confidence without the harshness  Hey  I m 36  and the harshness issue suddenly seems important  The 16 quot  wheels look a little lost in the large fender wells  the 17s look just right  I am a little dismayed at Ford s putting H rated tires on a GT  if you get the 16 quot  wheels  and making you shell out extra for a set of real tires  I think anything calling itself a performance coupe should have V or Z rated tires  at least  Keep in mind that in pure stock configuration  the GT can exceed the speed rating of H rated tires hmmmmm I m thinkin   quot Firestone 2   The Sequel quot  happenin  here For the mechanically curious  1  My GT has 5 000 miles on it now  and I ve been to the dealer once for warranty work on the rear axle carrier bearings  I don t know what I think of that yet  I had just been on a twisty N Calif coastal road where I thought I d see how spirited the car could get no abuse here  just alot of fun  The carrier bearings started making noise the very next day  defective set  did I break  em on my abuse session  are they of a weak design  I dunno 2  Gas mileage is at 22 1 with a 50 50 mix of town driving  amp  freeway raging  All town miles will yield just under 20  and all freeway  excluding stop and go commutes  will get you around 24  Not bad at all 3  The 4 6L is all aluminum  so beware of engine heat conditions  The warranty expressly excludes any damage due to overheat conditions  If you see the radiator warning light come on  stop immediately and get out the tow truck  The warranty also excludes damage due to lack of cooling system service  go every year to the dealer and get documented servicing of your cooling system Yea  there s faster  for a bunch more money  yea  there s better looking  a matter of taste  but no car crosses the performance styling curve with the dollar curve quite like the Mustang  It all comes down to value br br
