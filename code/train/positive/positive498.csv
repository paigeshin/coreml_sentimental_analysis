 Granted  this is my first SUV so I didn t know what to expect  I did my homework with all the SUVs out there and knew I wanted a 4X4 automatic with a few nice things in it and a few of the standard things I did a lot of comparisons of different SUVs  using Consumer Reports Car Service  and I always found that the ESCAPE was at the top of the list Needless to say they were scarce to say the least I was online everyday looking for one  I struck gold one on a Tuesday made the deal on Saturday I have a soup to nuts XLT with the only thing missing being the side air bags The first and probably the most impressive thing to grab and get your attention is the power this baby has  V6  you say to yourself over and over as you fly down the road  With that said and in spite of it s power it s handling is just as impressive  Turning on a dime with a SUV can you believe it yes you can  The fact that it takes runs on regular gas is simply a joy  Call me silly but with the power and performance of that power you would expect premium gas hands down  Inside is roomy  The rear seats are easy to maneuver once you get the hang The dash is easy to read and everything is at your fingertips  Plenty of storage  big and small Convenience  cargo cover and net are a nice touch  an additional 12v outlet in the rear Access to the rear can be done via opening the rear door or opening the glass window and reaching in I dislike the shifter on the steering column  It s very long even though I still find myself grabbing the windshield wiper instead  At night you can t see the shifter so when you reach for the radio cassette CD controls you can  as I have  hit the shifter which scares the living daylights out of you  I have since put a white wrap around it so I can t miss it Because of it s power and it s power and power  you do really move  Because of this you find yourself in the station often  I think it has a mind of it s own   on the highway mileage is great  On the streets it s chomping at the bit to go but you can t so it seems like it makes you pay for not putting it on the highway A simple thing but the rear window wiper is a bit of wimp It cleans only a small semi circle   you can see out it but for me I wanted more window cleaned
