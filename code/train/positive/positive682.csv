 I managed to get ahold of the keys for a new 2000 model year Ford Focus ZX3  Honestly  I wasn t sure what to expect from this car  I d seen small Fords before  specifically the Escort  and remembered that that vehicle was characterized by a bare bones interior  very little power  and sloppy handling  The Ford Focus blew most of my expectations out of the water It s equipped with a rather gutsy 2 liter Zetec four cylinder  The engine is reasonably quick to respond  and provides good acceleration for a car of this class and price range  Stopping power was handled by front disc rear drum brakes  and the vehicle stopped reliably  However  the pedal feel was too spongy for my liking  and the car as a whole felt rather dull as far as powertrain The car s transmission shifted well  but hunted a bit for gears and hesitated slightly when power was demanded of it  While acceptable for a car of this class  it s not a sportster by any means However  the handling is an entirely different story  The car rides on 15 quot  diameter wheels  with low profile tires  Alloy wheels are standard on this model  and the split five spoke design fits the car quite well  without drawing too much attention to them  The car s handling is very crisp and precise  The power rack and pinion steering is well weighted  providing enough resistance to feel just right  without being overboosted  The car has a very sprightly  nimble feel to it that most people will enjoy  especially in a car of this class The interior is actually reasonably equipped  The front buckets are comfortable  but I wouldn t want to be stuck in them for more than a few hours  Rear seat room is typically cramped  as is rear headroom  Front headroom  however  is not a problem  Front legroom  on the other hand  is  The seat could use another inch or two of travel  as even pushed all the way back  it was just not far back enough  and my knee brushed against the steering column  A tilt wheel is an option  and one I reccomend you get  Otherwise  the guages could be obstructed by the steering wheel  The radio controls in this car are fairly large  and easy to use  This car had the CD stereo  and it sounded fairly good  with some distortion at high volumes  However  there s quite enough power in the stock unit to overcome most road noise  Not that there is much  For a compact car  this vehicle has a well behaved  quiet ride  Highway irregularities are for the most part ignored  and only the bigger stuff gets really noticed  Again  they ve dialed in just a little bit of that feel that makes a good car great This is a solid  well rouned economy car  that is also a good budget enthusiast s car  With spirited handling and a reasonably comfortable interior  this Ford s not a bad choice at all br br
