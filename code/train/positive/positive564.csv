 I have a 80 mile round trip to work each day  which means a lot of wear  amp  tear in a short time  Having  quot been there quot  with front wheel drive and its mechanical weaknesses  this time I wanted low tech and low maintenance  That means good ol  stone age rear wheel drive   Pretty much the reason cops  amp  cabbies prefer Crown Vic s  The Mustang was exactly what I wanted  The V6 and 5 speed make all the power a grown up commuter could ask for  while large  3 8l  for its output  150 HP  the engine makes plenty of low rev torque and will chirp its tires in second gear if asked  All while delivering a comfortable  if heavy  ride  The standard 80 watt stereo with CD sounds excellent  with plenty of clean volume and enough bass for anyone short of a rap fan  One thing to be aware of is that on snow or ice you will IMMEDIATELY be aware that this is a rear drive car  I would gladly have paid extra for the limited slip axle used on the GT s if it was available  If you do a lot of driving in these kind of conditions  you should probably consider another car  With 40000 miles on the car  it s as solid as the day it was made  Nothing has failed  malfunctioned  or broken  It was also equipped with the cleanest brakes I ve ever seen  When they re due for replacement  which won t be for a while yet  I ll actually get the replacements at a Ford dealer   they re that good  The GT wheels that came with the Sport Appearance Package have a durable finish and are blessed by being free of nooks and crannies that make other wheels such a chore to clean  Make sure your car gets to a dealer to have a  quot silent quot  campaign fix  there is a kit available to re route the fuel hoses coming from the charcoal canister  Otherwise the car has a tendency to pass a gasoline odor into the passenger compartment after the car has sloshed its fuel around in stop and go driving  It s a free fix from the factory  Overall  the car is a pleasure br br
