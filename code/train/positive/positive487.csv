 We purchased our SuperCrew in Feb  2001  Ours is a 4x4 Lariat  5 4 liter  with navy blue on tan leather interior  We ve owned 2 Ford trucks prior to this one  so we were quite familiar with them  My husband is a general contractor and realtor  so hauling equipment and or building supplies as well as people were both equally important  I think we ve found the best of both worlds with this truck  This truck rides well  in fact  it s the one we choose to drive long distances  We have 3 children  and the interior is roomy enough to please  The dual media is a nice option  and the factory radio sound quality is great Here are some problems we ve encountered with this truck  1  As previously stated  this is our 3rd Ford truck  On all 3  we ve always had to have the up down window button on the passenger side only  replaced  For some reason  they re always defunct  Do something about this  Ford   covered by warranty  2  The cassette player won t release my tape  We thought maybe the tape was defective  but it turns out the CD player won t work either  Our Ford dealer has ordered us another radio which is covered by warranty  3  The fuel pump had to be replaced  This also was covered by warranty This truck is pretty fast too  You don t have to fret about changing lanes on the highway in this  I m 5ft 4in  and have no trouble whatsoever driving this truck  In fact  I prefer driving it to my 2000 BMW  There are no blind spots  and it handles well  plus there s no need to cringe when you hit a pothole
