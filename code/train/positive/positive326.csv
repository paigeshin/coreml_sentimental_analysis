 In November of 1999  my wife decided that she was interested in an SUV and wanted to trade in our 1997 Dodge Ram  I had bought a 1999 Jeep Wrangler for myself earlier in the year  so who was I to argue We went to all of the differant dealers in the area and checked out the Dodge Durango  the Jeep Grand Cherakee  Chevrolet Blazer  GMC Jimmy and Tahoe  We then went to the Ford Dealer to see an Explorer before we went back to make a deal on the Duango  While walking across the lot to the Explorers my wife spotted the Expeditions  She immediatly locked on to a gold XLT and the Durango was forgotten  A test drive cinched the deal Since then we have taken a 1200 and a 600 mile trip experiencing all types of weather each time  The Expedition is a dream to drive  handles well and the gas mileage is reasonable  We get about 15 mpg in the city and about 18 on the highway  I have owned a good many vehicles in my time including a new Cadillac Sedan Deville and this is my all time pick for comfort  Safety is another factor as you sit nice and high and the Expedition has a nice heavy secure feel  We have the small V8 and power is not lacking When we fold up the third seat we have all of the room we need and if we remove the third seat and fold the second seat the space approximates that of a pickup  Long objects like lumber fit on the roof rack We have added tinted window vents  about  40  tinted front windows  about  70  and a K amp N air filter  about  55  When backing the vehicle seems longer than it is and the rear window being up so high makes it appear that vehicles and objects behind you are closer than they are One special luxury that we enjoy is the power operated adjustable gas and brake pedal  My wife is 5 2 quot  and runs the pedals all the way up and I like to have the lowest pedal setting  A touch of a button is all it takes  The only item I wish that it had was the memory settings for the seat adjustments but we can live without them All in all Ford has a winner with the Expedition  the comfort of a luxury car while giving more room for passengers and cargo  I had doubts at first about getting rid of our pickup because it was so handy  but no more  I am sold on the Expedition  We looked at the Excursion while we were at the Ford dealer but it was just too big for us Try one on for size and I ll bet you will be the next buyer br br
