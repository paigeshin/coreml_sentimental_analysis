 I ordered a New Eddie Bauer in the Fall of 98  1999 Model  The reason i waited is because of the HP increase and the Torque increase on the New Triton engine  I pull a 23  Sea Ray boat which weighs over 4000lbs and felt I needed the extra power to handle the load  The expedition handles it very well  We added all the bells and whistles ie adjustable peddles for the short wife  power drivers seat for me  6 disc CD changer  Always get all the toys because it helps resale  I am glad Ford finally switched from the twin I Beam suspension  The new system will work much better  The ride is comfortable  like sitting up above the other traffic especially at night  Gas milage is not bad  received 13 6 mpg on recent trip out west  I also own a 1995 Ford F150 Eddie Bauer that does not do as good on milage so i guess the 13 mpg is not bad  I waited for the new Excursion to come out but Ford kept delaying  After looking at the new Excursion I am glad I bought the Expedition
