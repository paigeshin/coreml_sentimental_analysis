 Ford has done an overall excellent job designing and building their new Super Duty line of trucks  with only a few exceptions  I own a 1999 F250 Super Duty crew cab short bed 4x4 with the Powerstroke diesel engine and an automatic transmission that I ordered from the factory and took delivery of in May of 1999  I also recently helped relatives order their new 2000 F250 Super Duty super cab  short bed 4x2 with the Triton V8 engine and automatic transmission  The Excellent stuff The new Ford Super Duty trucks are the largest  tuffest  roomiest  nicest riding  and have the highest available tow ratings of any full size trucks in their class  The crew cab is particularly spacious in the front and rear seats  I am 6 2 quot  tall and 225 lbs  and I and 5 others of my size could quite comfortably ride for many hours in my truck  all the while towing a very large boat or travel trailer  I call my truck the   quot 4x4 Limo quot I love the Powerstroke diesel engine  but it is definitely not for everyone  The diesel engine has a very high torque rating of 500 ft lbs  and can more easily tow large boats or trailers than the GM trucks with their existing diesel engine  or the Dodge trucks with their Cummins engine  I know this because I used to own a 1994 Dodge 3500 4x4 with the Cummins diesel engine  The Cummins diesel engine is a great  extremely durable engine  but the Powerstroke is equally durable and has a more modern electronically controlled direct injection system  The Ford Powerstroke engine also meets California Low Emissions Vehicle status  as does all of Ford s Super Duty engines The styling of the truck is also excellent  When driving down the road  you sit about a foot higher than most other similar trucks and SUVs  The drop down window design in the front doors contributes to excellent visibility of any nearby objects  and helps in parking  etc  The optional telescoping trailer towing mirrors are large  extremely useful and adjustable for wider or narrower trailers  The truck has a key locking tailgate  a nice touch  The crew cab seats are very comfortable and the leg room in the back is better than most luxury full size cars  The solid body structure of the crew cab is another contributor to a nice solid and quiet ride The Not As Good Stuff The Ford Super Duty trucks are very heavy across the line  They are between 500 and 1 000 lbs heavier than comparably equipped models from GM and Dodge  My truck weighs 7 200 lbs  full of fuel with no one and nothing in or on it  That is a lot  and more than I expected  Some of this weight is due to the somewhat larger size of the Ford Super Duty trucks  Some of it is because the other manufacturers  GM in particular  have been more aggressive in trying to keep the weights of their trucks down  As a result of this heavier weight  the Ford Super Duty trucks get slightly lower fuel economy when compared to similarly equipped competitor trucks Some people have complained of automatic transmission problems  particularly when towing moving very large loads in extended extremely hard working situations  I have had absolutely no problems with my automatic transmission  There has been some other minor problems that I have heard from others and one recall notice for a minor fix  So  the truck is not perfect  but I love mine very much and wholeheartedly recommended it to others If you live and drive in a crowded major city  parking will kill you with this truck  They are simply large and heavy trucks  and one must be completely honest about what you really need  want and can live with P S  I have a tremendous amount of additional information from my ownership experiences  negotiating and ordering the truck  and from past trucks that I have owned  1992 Ford  1994 and 1998 Dodge and my new 1999 Ford  If anyone has specific questions  please feel free to email me at LVSeng aol com Good luck and enjoy br br
