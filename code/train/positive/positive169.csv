 I have found that used Explorers are a good investment most of the time  It seems that previous owners take pride in maintaining these vehicles in top condition  I own a 1995 Explorer  Eddie Bauer Edition  This vehicle still looks new and drives just like new  It handles well and gives a firm ride  which is what a sport utility vehicle is supposed to do  If you are looking for a soft luxury ride  don t buy a SUV  buy a luxury car  But  if you are looking for a good handling  firm ride and towing abilities  then consider a new or used Ford Explorer in the 4 door body style  not the 2 door Sport  it is short and the ride is not as good  The only problem I have encountered in 86 000  miles is when towing the gas mileage drops dramatically  I have the V 6  should have had a V 8 br br
