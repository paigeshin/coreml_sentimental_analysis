 I owned an Escort several years ago  and I didn t care for it mainly because of a bad 3 speed transmission  But now  with the new Escort  it s like a totally different car  I considered this car  at first  mostly because of the price  I purchased this new Escort a couple months ago I already have 10 000 miles on it  and it is the best compact I have ever had  The engine is quite fast and the features for the price are out of this world  I have air  automatic  power locks  power doors  power mirrors  rear defrost  car alarm  etc  It is the best equipped car for the price  I checked out a Saturn  Cavalier  Honda Civic  Hyundi  Dodge Neon  etc  and nothing came with the features and a better price  It has a smooth shifting transmission and the handling is top notch  The only shortcomings are stiff seats go for the extra comfort seats Otherwise  I have no complaints  If you need a small car and you are on a budget  you can not beat this car  It is also well reviewed by other consumer mags  so ask around and you will see that everyone loves this little car  Ford was actually going to discontinue the Escort  but with the new design  it has been a huge success and they are keeping it  Buy it now br br
