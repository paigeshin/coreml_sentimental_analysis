 The Ford F 350 with the 7 3 Turbo diesel is the best truck on the road  With its 500lbs of torque it will pull just about anything  Horse trailers  trailers are no problem for this truck  it pulls a hill with a trailer behind it as if it was not there at all  Comfort is a given in this truck  wether you get the 40 20 40 seats or the Captains chairs you will ride in comfort  The adjustable seat belts make it easy for a tall or short person to be comfortable and not have a strap rub them over their neck  The mileage factor with the 7 3 is fantastic  when you are not pulling a load 22 mpg is normal and under load 18 is average  You will leave a Dodge Cummings in the dust if you are both pulling a hill  the power is fantastic As the saying goes  quot Try it you ll like it quot br br
