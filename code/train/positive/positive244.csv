 I just recently bought a ford escort because of the style of the car  This is a new type of car for my family  I think the car it s self is roomy and smooth riding  This ford escort is really good on gas  I recently took the car on a short road trip  You don t hear much road noise  Any one who is looking for a good dependable car should look into getting one except those with to small kids wish are in car seats  The only problem I had with it so far is that the radio volume will get louder then it wll go real low br br
