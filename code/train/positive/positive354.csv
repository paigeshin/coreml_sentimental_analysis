 I bought a 1988 Ford Taurus in 1996  It was a one owner four door sedan  Now I got to tell you  I do some serious driving  I drive back and forth to work 50 miles one way  This is a Monday through Friday driving experience and sometimes in not so nice weather because I live in Minnesota  After racking up the miles on our Ford Taurus  my husband took it over because he only drives 1 mile to work each day  We love that Ford so much that we went out and bought another one in 1999  Not just any Ford Taurus my friends  but another 1988 Ford Taurus  It was also a one owner four door sedan with low miles  We have been very pleased with the Fords  They run and run and run and run  I can depend on my Ford  I know that when I get up in the morning it will start and when I drive home it will get me there  We make sure the cars get a regular 3000 mile oil change and a six month check up with the old Auto Doc  Maintenance costs have been low and repairs not much to speak of really  I figure that I will be looking for another car in about 2 years and I can tell you with confidence that it will be a Ford Taurus br br
