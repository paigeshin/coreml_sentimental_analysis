 I bought a 93 Probe GT in 97 5 speed  no automatic for me  when I first saw the new designed Probes I knew I would someday buy one  so when I got a good job I went out and bought my dream car  At first it was awesome I never drove a car that handled so good or accelerated so fast  everyone gave me compliments on how nice the car looked  But when I bought the car it had 84 000kms 52500miles  and with most cars this is when things started going wrong with it  I will list in order my problems I had 1  o2 sensors the probe has two of them when not working properly the car will use a lot of gas and show a engine lite on  parts are very expensive  note  if you live anywhere where they do emission testing the car will fail with the o2 sensors not working 2  valve cover gasket   oil will leak into the spark plug holes causing the wire to short out  gasket price is cheap but there is a lot of labor involved 3  ABS sensor the car will make a buzzing noise and show the ABS lite on  you can still drive the car like this but the abs will not work parts are expensive 4  water pump there is a lot of labor involved in this job too   I would definitely recommend to change the timing belt when doing this job because the probe has a interference engine and if the belts ever breaks the valves will crash into the pistons 5  Air bag sensor lite  a lot of Probes owners I have talked to have had these five problems the air bag lite sensor is usually the problem but I was told only the dealership can do the diagnostics and they are expensive  Now I know that all cars have there problems but the Probe is special in which almost all the parts on it are twice to three times more than most cars  from the exhaust to the struts  but I think sometimes in life you buy a car that just can not part with and this car is mine  I have heard of a lot of other problems the Probe has  like the automatic transmissions have a lot of problems  But now that the probe is discontinued you can get one for pretty cheap  just make sure you check to see if the previous owner got this work done  above  Just remember parts are expensive  and winter driving in deep snow is not fun due the fat tires and light back end of the Probe  I still own this car today and have no plans to sell it  the probe has it own unique look where most new cars are all looking the same
