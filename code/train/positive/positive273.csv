 We now own our third Ford Festiva  Well actually the first one was a Fiesta  the forerunner of the Festiva  it still has the same features actually  I am a happy camper here The durability is tops  The gas mileage is tops  We have traveled numerous miles in this auto spending very little in fuel or maintenance  It s economy features is astonishing  It s rugged and durable  Also  cheapest tires on the market If you are looking for economy this is it  If you are looking for luxury forget it  This auto was popular for it s economy  not quality of ride  I do not have a problem with it s ride  etc  I have thoroughly enjoyed each one we have owned   Bought all of them used It s sporty look and  cuteness  appeals to the young and old alike  I realize some are eye soars as with any automobile  and it s  savings  appeals to all  It s ease of parking is wonderful  squeeze into those tight spots that others have to drive away from  It has great pick up and go power  I prefer the automatic over the standard any day  however  the standard shift has more go power as with any standard really br br
