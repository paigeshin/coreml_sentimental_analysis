 we have now had our v10 F250 for 2 years we bought one of the first 2000 s back in October 1999  The truck has an automatic and the v10 engine having 310bhp and around 450ft lb torque  Its a pulling monster  We have the truck set up with 3 73 rear gears it is not a four wheel drive  We pull a 19 foot boat weighing in with trailer gas and all of us at about 4500 lbs  The truck still runs like there is no weight behind it  gas mileage drops from about 15 to 16 to around 12 to 14 depending on speed we have found that about 65 is the best speed to gas mileage ratio  The interior of the truck is wonderful it is a xlt with all options  It has a cd player which could be better  The air is ice cold and the heater blows out air hot enough to burn you  It relativley quiet inside the main thing you hear is the ten cylinders in front of you working  Room in the back is exceptional  Room in the front is more then anyone would ever need  We have taken the truck on many vacations and it has gotten about 17 miles to the gallon then not to bad for a 6 8L engine  With a roll top cover the bed is virtually waterproof and lockable
