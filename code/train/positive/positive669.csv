 As my 16th birthday rolled around  the dream of owning a hot set of wheels became more prominent in my blonde little head  I knew nothing about cars  engines  etc  but I did know that I loved the color purple  This 1997 V6 Mustang that sat at a local dealer was very much purple  and is now very much mine  My boyfriend  who is a die hard Chevy man  warned me about the car  but now has grown to love it almost as much as me As far as power goes  the V6 is all I will ever need  although it may be a little sluggish for some power hungry people  I adore the color  a bright vibrant purple that I can only find in  97 Stangs  and I think the light grey interior is tasteful  The power locks  windows  and seats are a luxury that I have grown to appreciate  The front seats are very comfortable and with being only 4 11  tall  the power up button on the seats makes driving very comfortable  However  as for any sports car the backseat is perfect for holding my backpack  shopping bags  and purse but not my friends  The gas cap can be slightly awkward as I recall being at a filling station 30 minutes away from home  the needle on  E  bawling to my boyfriend on my cell phone that I couldn t figure it out  Once I got the hang of it  there hasn t been any problems since  Speaking of gas  it gets around 25 mpg when I drive it in town and about 18 mpg when my bf drives it   Although  I ve been told that Mustangs are  a dime a dozen  I take pride in the fact that I drive a new model of an original classic car  I also take pride in the stares I receive when I drive down the road  I also like the fact that aftermarket parts are so easy to find  so fixing one up is a breeze All in all  I suggest this car for anyone who doesn t have children  usually drives alone  and wants a good looking car
