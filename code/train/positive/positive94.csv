 I purchased a used Ford Expedition in late 1999 when my job begin requiring me to go to remote radio tower repeater sites in the Ozarks The Expedition was simply the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned  I felt very safe and secure with nearly 3 tons of metal around me  the 4 wheel drive relieved me of hiking into remote sites carrying 75 or so pounds of radio test equipment I thoroughly researched available SUVs before I made the plunge  and the Expedition was the only one which met all of the criteria for my uses The only problem I have had has been a small hole was worn in a  T  fitting on the engine resulting in a check engine light and rough idle  About  45 dollars at the deal fixed it I will probably be getting rid of it soon as my job duties have changed once again  and I no longer need the 4 WD  and I am driving farther to work  The Expedition has the 5 4 engine with the trailer towing package and only gets about 13 14 MPG on the highway  I will most definitely miss it  but it s running me nearly  40 week for gasoline
