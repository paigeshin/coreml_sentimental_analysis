 I own a 96 two tone  North Woods limited edition Ford Ranger whats so limited bout it  I don t really know  its a 2 3liter 4 banger w  a stick  five overdrive  standard cab  long bed  Though I wish it was the otherway around  ext  cab  short box  Not enough leg room  and it doesn t have tilt  I heed you this  Dont get a Ford Ranger that doesn t have tilt steering  Thou can be dealt w  but gets frustratting on long trips  Overall seating is ahh well I guess comfortable for short rides but w  standard cab your bound to feel confined after an hour or longer trip  trust me I know  And I m not that tall either  at 5 10 quot  my knees start to bother me on long hauls  due to not so perfect seating arrangment  No  its not the clutch either  that I would add is very controled and perfectly calibrated  Not to hard or to mushy  just right feel  and very strong  even after one hell of a rigorois beating of tryin to sport the damn thing and revin up the r s to a point of redline and popping the clutch numerios times if I may add too  even after 41k miles  feels just the same as new  exactly the same  actually better due to break in  Brakes extremely well even though only has front anti lock  chassis settles very well and keeps comepletely controlled under exteme hard braking  manueverabititly well  Very well built  no problems at all Stong frame that can take much streess when pushed hard  can handle heavy loads very well  obvios engine lag and clutch stress but never seems to be a problem  Ya gotta consider  its only a 4 and its not built for speed or much power either  But is indeed an all around very trustworthly truck  Interior wise again  96 was the year that Ford transferd over to the more streamlined sexy looking interior all rounded off and flashier looking  Not enough elbow room left side     door side  seats pushed to close to door to make more room between seats  don t like that  Good visibility for instumentation  Very easy to use and explanatory fuctions make truck easy to drive  Like the rear cargo light  that isn t available on the S 10  so thats a plus for ford  but would like the option to have it on a separate swith  they come on w  the interior when turning on interior light which isn t to bad thou  Biggest disapointment  again the leg room on standard cab  The truck as a whole isn t all that aerodynamically designed or looking  but there isn t much road noise anyhow  Long bed accomates enough space  thou wish bed was just at least a bit deeper  Rear tailgate good weight  not to heavy  and not to light to bounce around on freeway when open either  Good overall road site   though having tilt would allow more over the hood  has great lighting for night driving  Thou one thing I dont like about fords new design of the wind shield wiper blade speed is that everytime you use the blinker  you can t help but to hit it and accidently change it  it being located right on the outside of the blinker lever  Thats where I give props to chevy  having the dial in the middle of the lever  0 60  with stick isn t all that bad w  no load  but can t sustain high speed cruise over 90 95 for the life of it  Winter months w  out any weight in the back totally suck here in MI w  all the snow we get  if you live in a snow climate  i d strongly advise 4WD  It looks better for the trucks anyways  the big tires  high stance  its speaks RANGER  4 banger s good on gas  but if you crave power  then its the 4 0 that you need w  out a doubt  Its a good starter truck  thats really all to it Anyquestions feel free to E mail at Tama1000 hotmail com br br
