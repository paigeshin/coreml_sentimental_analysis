 If they did  they probably wouldn t be millionaires  No one in their right mind should have to pay  2000 to  3000 above MSRP  like some dealers are charging for the 2002 Odyssey  In fact I looked at a used 2000 Odyssey in my area with 40K that was  27 000 So I purchased a very clean used 99 Ford Windstar SE with 32K for  14000  My second child will be here in a couple of months so I reluctantly had to make the big break from a car to a minivan Would I have liked a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV  Yes Could I have afforded a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV  Yes Do I want to afford a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV  NO It was a simple question of value  Getting something that works for not much money  Let s face it  The majority of Post 1980 s vehicles are ALL much more reliable than they used to be  Ford  Chrysler  GM  etc  A hundred thousand miles is nothing these days  250K is a more realistic goal now  You don t need a Honda or Toyota to achieve that anymore Furthermore I ve owned three Hondas  Two Accords and one Civic  They are not without their  glitches  And regular maintenance costs  mufflers  brakes  any other parts you may need  are roughly twice the price of parts for domestic vehicles  The newer Hondas and Toyotas may be made in USA  but usually the parts are made overseas and are subject to import tariffs  Also a trademark of all my Hondas was a hard  uncomfortable seat  and a harsh ride  that would be  a good feel of the road  and  stiff handling  to the Honda fans  I drive 400  miles frequently with maybe one stop for gas  It became almost unbearable with a Honda seat  sometimes I would be saddle sore the next day  Seats may seem like small things to consider  but your hiney has a major interaction with your vehicle Most models of the Windstar have the features you most need  as do most of the minivans out there that aren t the absolute base model  It has comfortable seats  a comfortable  quiet ride  and most of all it is a good value  The thing is going to run for a long time  and I didn t have to break the bank to get one  Not only can I haul my kids with the Windstar  I have money left over to put a little away for their college fund If it needs a few repairs  so be it  The extra 13 Grand I would ve had to spend on a similarly used Honda will go a long way to any would be repairs
