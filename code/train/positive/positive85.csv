 The Ford Expedition is a wonderful SUV  The Expedition that I have the pleasure of owning is a 1998 Eddie Bauer edition with a 5 4 liter engine  The engine is more than capable of pulling the Expeditions weight plus another four or five thousand pounds of trailer  I have used the vehicle to pull a 22 foot sport boat to Arkansas and the truck did well in the hills of the Ozark Mountains  Stopping power with a trailer is also very good though added distance is needed of course  The 5 4 is also a very capable engine option in the mountains of Colorado  The truck moves well with the automobiles of lesser weight and ascends quickly up the steep inclines  Though 20  of a vehicles power is lost in the mountains the Expedition had power to spare  The Expedition does exceptionally well in the snow  I have four wheeled in about 8 inches of snow and could not get the vehicle stuck in drifts or otherwise  The vehicle is equipped with part time four wheel drive which allows it to be driven on dry roads with four wheel engaged  The truck senses wheel spin and puts it in four wheel drive only when needed  Full time and four low can also be selected with the flip of a switch which lock the four wheels in drive mode The Expedition has been a trouble free automobile for the past 30  000 miles  It has been to the dealership only to look at new Expeditions that I will definitely purchase when the lease expires  The lease that Ford offered has been trouble free and was explained well when I purchased the vehicle from Woodhouse Ford in Blair Nebraska  If you are hauling many people i e  8  then the rear seat is worth the  300 option price  However if you do not need it the seat is more of a hassle  When you wish to haul large objects in the back the seat leaves you with only one to two feet of cargo space when installed  The seat is however easy to remove with two people at each side  Also if you plan to buy a lot of groceries with the seat installed plan on putting them in the back seat or picking up your canned goods that fall all over when placed on top of the folded seat back  The truck has only needed routine maintenance such as oil changes and windshield wiper fluid  The oil is extremely easy to change for the do it yourselfer because the oil pick up and filter are separate from the engine block  The filter is located right up front and is vertically placed so no oil drips out when unscrewing the filter  Spark plugs on the overhead cam 5 4 engine last until 100 000 miles so I am not able to comment on changing those  however they look difficult to reach because the engine is recessed in its bay  The leather on the seats has held up well to wet swimsuits and dirty jeans  It cleans easily with a little leather cleaner  The only bad thing that I can comment on the vehicle is that it was not equipped with an outside temperature gauge  which is nice if the roads get slick and you want to see if it is freezing  It does however have an electronic distance to empty and compass gauge  The truck provides a commanding view of the road and is obstructed only by semi trucks and other trucks of that nature Plan on spending about  30 to fill the tank from empty at  1 20 per gallon gas prices  The 5 4 goes through the gas rather quickly getting about 300 350 miles from a full tank
