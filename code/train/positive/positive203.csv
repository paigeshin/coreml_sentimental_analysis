 The Ford Explorer is probably the most ideal SUV manufactured today  It s the perfect size  both inside and out  I am a school psychologist who travels about a school district that is over 900 square miles  so I log many  many miles weekly  The Explorer is very comfortable and easy to drive  The interior is nicely arranged with all knobs and handles easily within the driver s reach  There are also controls in the back seat for the music system and air conditioning and heating system  The rear cargo area is ideal for transporting my equipment and testing kits  leaving the back seat for passengers  Of course  one drawback is the tendency for this vehicle to roll over in an accident  but it is equipped  standard  with two airbags and seatbelts  which should be worn at all times  On the positive side  the Explorer rates very high in overall safety and in crash tests  the drivers AND passengers in the Explorer have fewer injuries and deaths than most other vehicles  I drive mostly highway miles  but I find the gas mileage to be very competitive with more economy minded vehicles  It requires very little upkeep maintenance and retains its  resale  value very well  For the money  it s quite a bargain br br
