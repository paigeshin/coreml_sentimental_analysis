 I bought my Ford Escort ZX2 in November  1999  It was the first new car that I ever bought  I d previously purchased used cars  I didn t do a good job comparison shopping  and ended up paying more for it than I should have p The car is great  I love the way it runs  the way it looks  and the way it sounds  I get about 28 miles per gallon  and that s so important with today s gas prices p The only drawback that I ve found with this car is the price of the tires  Ford Motor Company decided to use a certain size tire on these cars  and Goodyear is the ONLY manufacturer of this particular size  There is no other size that fits on the rims   I went to 4 different tire dealers looking for cheaper tires  The lowest I found was  79 00 per tire   plus installation p Since 2 of my tires were bad  and the other two had a lot of wear  I replaced all 4 tires  These  79 tires lasted only a few months   I went to another tire dealer who told me it may be possible to get different rims  He looked in a junkyard for me and found 4 rims for  60  yes  used  BUT I was able to then get  normal  sized tires at only  35 each   The big drawback of all this is now I have  ugly  rims  black with no chrome  on my car that I should now paint p All in all  I do love my car
