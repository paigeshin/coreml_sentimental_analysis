 At first  I wasn t very excited about getting my 1995 Ford Escort  I had just turned 16 and was hoping for something more along the lines of a V8 Camaro  or a big muddin  truck  Then as I drove my Escort more and more  I began to realize how much I really did appreciate its features  All my friends with those huge engines spend a small fortune in gas money  while my little 4 cylinder costs about  6 a week on average  I drive mainly to school and work  but sometimes I take trips all over the nation to race my bicycle  On the highway  the escort runs like a champ  It gets wonderful gas mileage  and it rides really nice and quiet  It can really move if you want it to  I have topped mine out at 135MPH  and it still managed its smooth ride  It felt like it was meant to be driven fast like that  I have only had a few minor mechanical problems with it  I have purchased a new set of tires  a fan belt  and a battery  The biggest problem that I have had is the brakes  I have spent a total of at least  500 replacing them  The first time  I bought all new brakes  pads  and cylinders  The second time  I decide to buy new pads  It has been over a month since the second trip to the shop  and they haven t squeeked yet  I would recommend the purchase of a 1995 Escort to anyone who wants an economical  quiet  and overall nice car  rather than someone who wants to drag race and spend  100 s fixing it up to make it nice br br
