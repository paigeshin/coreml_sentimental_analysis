 Bought truck brand new September 1996  XL Shortbed 4 9 engine 5 speed with 3 55 rear end  has 100 000 miles  I bought this truck for use in my landscape buisness  it has never been driven without a trailer in tow  usually about 3 000 lbs  Still has original clutch   amazing  has only gone through one set of front brake pads  I had a problem with a leaky smog tube which was misdiagnosed and ended up costing over  1200  and have replaced both fuel pumps and had the fuel system cleaned out at a cost of  1400  however this may have been caused by running the tanks low to avoid gas stops  I live in the Arizona desert and the truck is parked outside so I am very impressed that the finish still looks like new  as does the interior  this vehicle is very sun resistant  The engine runs flawlessly in stop and go driving with heavy loads in the Arizona heat of 100 110 degrees  and is pleasant to drive  I must say I am very pleased with this vehicle  it has made me a ton of money and still looks and runs like new
