 I purchased my 1999 Ford Explorer 2 X 4 SUV in May  I have had severe back surgery and needed something that was elevated in height so I could get in and out easily  I needed something that was big enough in the back seat where my two small children wouldn t constantly complain  quot he she is touching me quot  The seats fit my back wonderfully and there is so much room in it not only in the front  but in the rear passenger area  Now  let s talk about the cargo area  When I go to the Sam s Club to purchase bulk items  I don t worry about where I am going to put everything  There is so much room  plus I have the option of folding down one side  or both sides  of the rear passenger area to make even more room  On one particularly lengthy trip  my husband and I folded down the rear passenger seat  spread out the children s sleeping bags and they were as happy as clams at high tide  I am absolutely thrilled with my SUV br br
