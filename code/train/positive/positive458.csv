 I got the one that has 130 hp with the 2 0 liter engine  This is NOT the 143 hp  2 3 liter PZEV engine for late 2003 or 2004  This car is what I stated in the title The ride is extremely smooth  You feel like you are in a cockpit while driving  The front seat is the most comfortable I sat in  Sharp turns and the power steering are great  I get 26  mpg for phenomenal power  Before I got it I tried out some luxury sports cars  I see NO difference  With it s compact size it is easier to go between cars and fit into cramped parking spaces when necessary  This is the best hatchback or compact car Now for the downs to put up with if you are single  With a 5 speed s power can lag a little going up steep hills  Passengers in the backseat will find little leg room  Have up to one passenger regularly especially for long trips  For my trunk I had to buy a  3 in 1  toolbox at the hardware store for  30 and a  4 plastic box at K Mart For a small car with great power and handling the 2003 Ford Focus is as good as it gets  Other hatchbacks or compact cars weigh more  claim to give more miles per gallon  and have a smaller hood area  Expect costly and time consuming repairs in the long run with other little cars
