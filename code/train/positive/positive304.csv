 I have already written an epinion about a 1992 Ford Ranger that I used to own  but last week I traded it in for a 1998 model  This time I decided to go with the off road package which gave me the 4 0 liter V6 I love the power  A few nice emenities are a center counsel  five speed tranny  larger wheels and tires  and a hard tonneau cover  As for how it rides  it s pretty smooth  much better than I had expected out of a truck with an off road package  I also like the fact I sit higher than most other traffic  that is except for the onslaught of Suburbans and Expeditions  I am pretty comfortable driving this truck  it s a little cramped but tolerable  I m about average height  6 feet  so my legs are bent a little bit but it s not like my knees are rubbing on the steering wheel or anything  I don t think I can say enough about the acceleration and towing power of this truck I love it  After driving the standard 2 3L Ranger for awhile it sure is nice to have a little something behind the gas pedal again  Just to test it I tried towing my dad s car trailer  with my mom s Bravada on it  to see how it did and it handled it with no problem  Now I can t wait for summer to take the boat or jet skis out  One draw back to the extra power is the extra cost of gas  I don t think this is all directly due to the larger displacement though  now that I have a little power I m putting my foot in it a lot more as well  but on the highway it s getting right around 20 22 mpg br br
