 I am 19 years old and have had my ZX2 for a little over a year  I m happy to say that it has proved to be quite reliable  When I went looking for my first car my father and I looked at every conceivable small car on the market  Tercel  Corolla  Civic  Protege  Contour  Mirage  Saturn SL2  and Sentra  Except for the Saturn all of these small cars were excellent  The Saturn is sold by great dealers  but the car itself is unrefined  So why did I buy the ZX2  Well  first off the ZX2 had the most horsepower  130  Only the Contour with the V 6 had more  170  Also I had just read an article in the May 1997 issue of Car and Driver in which the ZX2 came in first place when compared to other small coupes  Moreover  Consumer s Reports had rated the 99 model at above average reliability  something that other domestic sedans  Cavalier and Neon  could not say  But enough with the boring stuff what the car is like in action is what convinced me to buy  Performance  I can t say enough about this car s acceleration  but 0 60 in 8 0 seconds should sum it up pretty well  The car has plenty of power in 5th gear  therefore when I want to pass on the parkway a downshift into 4th is not needed  There are some drawbacks to this engine though  It is kind of noisy at speeds above 3 000 rpm  but that s O K  most small 4 cylinders are  More annoying is that when the A C is on the compressor is always cycling  turning on and off  and it makes it feel as though the car has misfired  However  after reading some newspaper articles about the ZX2 it turns out this is normal  Ford intended the A C to cycle to save gas  Once the engine gets this car moving the suspension does not let you down  The handling is awesome   This car inspires confidence in the driver  and the tires have never squealed on me yet  The ride is pretty good too  Most of the large potholes are absorbed well  and the suspension makes a nice thud noise  Braking is O K  My car is equipped with ABS  but the brakes don t have an initial grippy feel Interior  The seats are nicely shaped up front  and the back seat is not bad for hauling around friends  I just recently completed a two hour road trip  and the car proved comfortable coming and going  The cruise control keeps the set speed very well  The factory installed power moon roof has never leaked  No problems with the power windows  locks  or keyless entry  I did have an after market CD player put in the dash  and because of the oval pod I had to pay  50 to get a special faceplate  Overall  I am very pleased with my decision to buy the ZX2  There are times  however  when I would have liked to have the extra two doors of a sedan  but whenever I long for those two doors the admiring looks I get from other drivers in their dowdy sedans  SUVs  and minivans always changes my mind  Not to mention the internal joy I get when I drive this car  IT IS JUST PLAIN FUN
