 I just bought a new 2000 Ford Taurus 3 weeks ago  and I ve put on 2000 miles so far  Overall  I am very happy with it BODY DESIGN The 2000 Taurus has a much cooler design than the bug eyed ovals of the last few year  I ve had many comments on how cool it looks  which is unusual for a family car  I read that they changed every body panel except the doors  Unfortunately  the design of the doors should have been changed  too  It is very prone to door dings since the top half curves out past the rubber bumper on the door  INTERIOR The interior is great  Both the front and back seats have a lot of leg room and elbow room  The controls are all easy to reach and easy to understand  ENGINE I have a 24 valve engine  It has significant power  It accelerates well from a standstill and at high speeds  The engine is very quiet in the passenger compartment  I also test drove a Volvo S40  and the engine was very loud  SOUND SYSTEM I have the Mach audio system which is Ford s top of the line  It sounds like a great home stereo system  My last car had Ford s premium sound  and I was not impressed  The Mach system is much better  One nice feature that my car has is a 6 disc changer with the cartridge inside the passenger compartment  This is available on the SE Comfort model if you get the floor shifter and center console  I also like that I have both a CD player and tape player OTHER FEATURES Automatic Temperature Control The automatic temperature control is a very nice feature  I can set a temperature and the car stays there  It is designed so most of the air blows toward the floor for maximum comfort  I really enjoy just setting the temperature to 68 or 70 and not messing with the controls after that Adjustable Pedals This is not a feature that I particularly wanted since I m pretty tall  However  it came with the car I bought  It seems like it would be a neat feature for someone who was shorter but wanted to sit further away from the steering wheel  With the touch of a button  you can adjust the pedals as much as 3 inches Air Bags I have side air bags  which is a nice saftey feature  In addition  the front air bags have extra sensors  The air bags will deploy at 3 different speed depending on the speed of the crash  the position of the seats  and whether the passengers have their seat belts on The driving experience is wonderful in this car  It is quiet  roomy  comfortable  and had a great sound system  I actually look forward to my commute for the first time in my life  I also love the new design I have had 2 minor problems  My airbag light came on 2 times in the first week  The dealership is not able to tell what may be wrong unless the light is on when I bring it in The second problem is that one of the back windows makes a clunk sound when it closes  The dealer attempted once to fix it  but he was unsuccessful  I will take it in again later br br
