 The Bronco II is an awesome vehicle  It can out maneuver any 4WD out there  except maybe the classic Bronco  has good power  it s comfortable  strong axles and manual transmission  5spd is the only way to go  rides great  etc  I can t say enough good things about my 1990 Bronco II XLT  I ve had it almost 2 years and enjoyed every bit of it  This thing is awesome  It s very versatile and rugged and you can do just about anything with it  check out bronco2 com and jamesduff com  I get great gas mileage for an older vehicle  It also has a pretty hefty 23 gallon gas tank  Most vehicles this size have no bigger than a 19 gal tank  The only major problems I ve had are one s I ve caused  I crushed the muffler 4 wheeling  punctured the gas tank 4 wheeling  and then the leaf spring sag and minor things to be expected with age  The leaf springs on Bronco IIs tend to wear out after a while causing rear end sag  but just a little  Nothing a leaf spring helper won t fix  I ve also seen 4 Runners with the same problem  Leaf springs are relatively inexpensive anyway  probably  150 180 for a full set  unless you get lifted springs  The B2 has outlasted my brother s  94 Jeep and his Saab 900  Ford makes great vehicles  It s got 194 000 miles and my bronco s still running strong  It s a pity that they quit making the B2 in 1990  I wish they still made  em  I love my Bronco II
