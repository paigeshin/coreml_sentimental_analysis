 Our small business needed a cargo van a year ago and you can t really buy a cargo van without at least considering the Econoline  The Big Three all make cargo vans that are comparable in size  cargo capacity and price  We researched  measured and drove each van for at least 3 days before we made the choice to buy the Ford We found the Ford to be the easiest to drive and the best equipped for the price no matter what engine you choose  The Chevy Express Cargo Van was a good second choice but was a little more expensive and the financing offered by GMAC at the time was inferior  The Dodge Van frankly hasn t changed a lot since the 70 s and it shows in every aspect We ended up with the E250 3 4 ton model with the V 6 engine  This engine is rated at 190 horsepower and can pull the van reasonably well unless you load it full of tools or heavy equipment  Users who will push the limits of the van s cargo capacity will not like the V 6  The ONLY advantage of the V 6 is the lower acquisition cost  The 4 6L V 8 makes more power and gets better gas mileage  not to mention better resale value if you sell the van before it is a box of rust We have had no mechanical troubles at all and have put 10 000 miles on it to date  There are a lot of these vans on the road today with over 200 000 miles on them  If we had to do it again we would get the V 8  Otherwise you really cannot go wrong with this van as a great work vehicle
