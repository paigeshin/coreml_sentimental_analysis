 I bought my 1995 Contour brand new  off the showroom floor  in July  1995  From day one  it has been a joy to drive comfortable  easy to handle and fuel efficient  And the air conditioner works very well a critical issue in the Texas heat While I don t drive every day  many of my trips keep me in the car for one to five hours at a time  The Contour makes those trips easy It is always a challenge to find a car both my 6 5  husband and 5 1  me can drive  I don t have any trouble reaching the pedals in the Contour  and my husband doesn t hit his head on the roof The car now has 70 000 miles on it  It has required minimal maintenance  you know  the usual  tires  brakes  oil changes  etc  and has been incredibly dependable  The only problem I can remember was with the sunroof switch  not factory installed  When the car sat in the sun and got hot  the switch wouldn t work  That took two trips to the dealership to get fixed Looking at the car  it was not my first choice  I thought  and still do  that it is a sort of boring little lump  My husband begs to differ he loves the styling  My mind started to change the second I sat in the car  and I was sold as soon as I drove it  It also helped that I found one in teal  a color I love My original plan was to keep this car about six years  however  as we get closer to the six year mark  I find myself thinking I don t want to give it up that soon   Update  10 02  I recently sold this car  after owning it 7 years and a couple of months  It had about 93 000 miles on it  and was still virtually trouble free  At one maintenance visit  the dealer service department mentioned that the AC clutch was a little loud  but didn t recommend doing anything because  in their words  the AC was  pumping out ice cubes  I hadn t heard the noise  and the AC continued to work well  In the last few months I owned the car  I noticed a bit of a squeal in the AC  but it continued to cool very well  even in the hot Houston summers   And you wouldn t hear the squeal if you turned up the radio a little   o   I loved owning and driving this car  The only reason I decided to get a new car was that I take quite a few long road trips and I was concerned  at nearly 100 000 miles  that it might become less reliable  I didn t want to have the car s first breakdown on some deserted stretch of Texas highway  My original review of the 1995 Ford Contour stands  It was reliable  economical and comfortable  And I hope it s new owner enjoys it for many years to come
