 Way before I got interested into writing about cars  the F series has been America s best selling truck  It s been like that for more than 25 years  In fact  many industry insiders will admit that the F series has saved Ford company when it hits hard times  It goes without saying that on our local freeways and highways  you will find an F 150 truck out of every 3 truck  I had never given much attention to the truck until I started spending more time on a friend s farm  It appears that all his father s trucks have been a F 150 over the years  What I have found to be the enduring values of this great vehicle are its practicality and strength  This year  the Ford 150 sounds quieter and more refined thanks to a 75 part noise  vibration and harshness upgrade  From what I can remember  the 2003 F 150 SuperCrew drives so much better than its predecessors  It appears that Ford can only continue to improve its well known crown jewels  This is a truck that has withstood times and economic hardships  It continues to deliver power and durability in the line of full size pickups  Based on the 2003 F series  I just can t wait to test drive the 2004 F series which has caused so much hoopla so far There are three trim series that are available on the SuperCab models XL  XLT and Lariat  It offers so much comfort and cargo carrying capacity that most buyers end up comparing it with its main competitors on the market  It makes sense that they end up purchasing this truck for the type of package and value   Taking a look at its interior  Some of the features that you will find on this truck include the following  standard power adjustable pedals  power moonroof and a functional bed extender in case you want to increase the box length for carrying longer items  This truck has come handy on the farm  Many construction workers purchase them too  It s great to carry cargo  Other features include  air conditioning  overhead console  power windows with delayed accessory power and one touch down driver s window  power locks  tilt steering wheel  speed control and power moonroof  Electronic automatic temperature control is standard on the truck To help secure your cargo  tie down hooks are located in each corner of all F 150 cargo boxes  In addition  you will find out that the cargo light on the back of the cab makes loading and unloading the truck box very easy at night  Ford designs this truck with the owner user in mind  To provide you with comfort  the designers place a rear step bumper that gives easy access to the cargo area  The tailgate can be removed for special loading duties b How about the truck s powertrain b F 150 SuperCab 4 2 liter OHV V 6 engine produces 202 horsepower and 252 foot pounds of torque  The split port induction system tends to optimize fuel efficiency and engine response  No wonder that I had a ball when test driving and working with this truck on the farm  Very few trucks are that responsive when you need them to  It comes with a four speed automatic overdrive transmission  That s an option that the owner wanted  With so many packages that are available out there on these trucks  you can have anything that you want as long as you can afford it  This is true in the case of the towing and payload ratings of the F 150 tester   With all those statistics  how did I feel driving the truck b i Ride  handling  safety and security issues  FYI  All F 150 trucks come equipped with a four wheel anti lock braking system  That s standard  The short and long arm independent fron suspension enhances my ride and handling  All in all  it was quite a smooth ride  I was amazed by its handling  For the driver and passenger  the truck is equipped with air bag supplemental restraint system  There is also the side door intrusion beams that help protect passengers or occupants in the case of a side door impact or accident  Countless lives may have been saved thanks to this upgrade  LATCH child safety seat tethers are standard equipment on the F 150 trucks  Also  belt minder system encourages safety belt use  This way  you won t have to drive long and short distances without putting on your belts  Remote keyless entry offers added convenience and security at night by activating the interior lights  How handy this features has come especially when you have to park away from the lighted parking lot  In the fields of California  we sometimes have to leave our trucks for very long periods of time b Final thoughts  The Ford 150 series can only get better  The company wants to innovate with the 2004 pickup too  If you have not gotten a Ford  you can wait for the 2004 truck  I don t necessarily trust other Ford vehicles  but after working with the F series  I would invite anybody to give it a try   Why should you buy the  a href content 104412515972 2004 Toyota Sienna a  Find out more
