 I m 6 4 quot  and own a  97 Ranger XL Regular cab pickup  I give the truck a rating of 5 stars because it is perfect for someone who wants what my particular truck has to offer  That being said I would buy a truck with different options features and configuration if I had it to do over again  Keep the following things in mind when you go to buy a Ford Ranger  or any other small pick up b Color  My truck is gorgeous black with metallic gray trim and a gray interior  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BLACK TRUCK AGAIN  Ok I say that now  and when I see another black beauty in the showroom I ll probably buy one again  The problem is that there isn t a hotter looking color for a truck than black  It looks tough  it looks sophisticated  it looks like Marty McFly s 1986 Toyota pickup that he dreams will be in his garage when he comes Back to the Future  Heaven forbid that you use your truck like a truck though  Any little scratch shows  I had a heart attack the first day I took my truck to the car wash only to see it come out with swirls where the dryer s terry cloth towel had been  You can imagine my dismay every time I haul mulch around  or put bags of cement in the bed  When clear coat gets scratched on a black paint job it shows up white  Black also looks terrible when it gets salt on it from a the Northeastern roads  I would say your best bet for truck colors is 1  silver  2  tan  3  white  4  red b Cab Size  Regular cab trucks have no benefit in riding convenience over a Mazda Miata  As a matter of fact  you might be able to get more stuff out of the weather in a Miata  than in my regular cab Ranger  I bought a truck box just to solve the problem of no interior space  At least the box gives me a place to put 1 or 2 bags of groceries  Really though  if you plan on hauling kids  or even going on long trips  either buy an extended cab  or buy another vehicle  A regular cab Ranger is only useful for around the town hauling  and possibly longer trips with only 2 people  Don t even think that you can fit a 3rd person in the middle seat especially with a stick shift b Bed style  I ve got a fleet side  long bed  and I love it  Fleet side trucks are the only ones that will fit 4x8 sheets of anything  The only advantage I can see to a step side is that it may have more stylish lines  Even that is debatable  Oh yeah  and it might be easier to climb up into the bed  if you tend to need to get in there often b 4x4 or 4x2  If you live in any location that has snow please do not buy a 4x2 pickup truck  I can t tell you how many people in the Northeast I see with their 4x2 s loaded to the hilt with sandbags only to still have no traction  I load up my 4x4 with sandbags just so that I don t have to have the 4 wheel on as much  The extra ground clearance of a 4x4  while making the truck a little top heavy  is a great when you want to clear the 3 foot snowdrift that the plow left for you at the end of your driveway  My truck has locking hubs and a shifter on the floor to engage the four wheel drive  This is a really nice system as I only lock the hubs between November and April  snow season  The truck gets better gas mileage when the hubs are unlocked  When I need the four wheel I just shift the extra shifter  and it s on   even at full highway speed  Now the alternative is the push button four wheel drive which is the equivalent of having the hubs locked at all times  This means a little worse gas mileage  but a little easier operation  only having to push a single button whenever you want 4 wheel b So  what s so great about your Ranger b Well  the stick shift V6 is smooth as silk  There s plenty of power there for all road conditions  I can t vouch for the towing power until I get a nice toy to test it with  I have a rubberized floor which means a whisk broom and a hose cleans out the interior quickly  The seats are the most comfortable of any of the trucks I tested  Dodge  Chevy  Toyota  While the regular cab is small  I have no problem taking the truck on long trips  The aluminum alloy wheel are stylin  and non corrosive so they should stay shiny forever  The price was right   with new college grad discounts and rebate I only paid  15 000 for a brand new 4x4 set of wheels b What sucks about your Ranger b The thing didn t come with a cup holder  Now  this is not indicative of all Rangers because I ve seen other Rangers with cup holders  I guess it was just my combination of stick shift with 4 wheel drive shifter on the floor that made the designers think that they couldn t fit a cup holder  I managed to install one of my own no problem  The Regular cab   my next truck will have an extended cab  or be one of those SUP s  Sport Utility merged with a pickup  so that I ve got ample interior space  and still have a bed for hauling dirty stuff  The Black paint   for the reasons mentioned above All I can say is know what you re getting into before buying a small truck  They re not for everybody  If they re for you  I would definitely recommend buying a truck in the Ford Ranger series
