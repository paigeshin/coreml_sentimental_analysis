 I purchased my 1988 Ford Taurus in 1989 and at this time I have 87 000 miles on it  It has a 3 0 liter engine and when taking it on vacation I got 34 miles to the gallon  I have replaced tire rods on it  but by keeping the oil changed and keeping good coats of wax on it I hope to get more time out of the vehicle  There was a couple of winters I stored it but the vehicle has been ran all year round for about the last 5 years I really like how solid the vehicle is  The reason I know is I was hit from behind with a lot of force and it put just a little scratch on the bumper  The car rides very nice and has a large trunk perfect for taking on vacation  This car may not be for the single person  but it surly makes a good family vehicle
