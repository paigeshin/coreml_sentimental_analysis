 In June we bought the Sony Limited Edition Focus SE 4 DR Sedan  Simply put this is one great little car  We have the vehicle equipped with AT  PS PB  PW  PDL  CC  Tilt Wheel  Comfort Group  Sport Group  Alarm w  Keyless Entry  and the AWSOME Sony Xplod Stereo  The Sony Limited Edition Focus is a Limited Production of 7000 Vehicles  and comes in AT  amp  5 spd  and is only available in four color choices  Green  Black  Infa Red   amp  Going Platinum  with the last being unique only to the Sony Edition  The Sony Xplod has a CD Head unit w  30 pre sets  a CD Player w  remote  and a 450 watt Amplifier  amp  12 quot  Sub Woofer mounted in the trunk  It is one awsome stereo  and will drive you out of the vehicle if you really crank it up  I have never heard such a wonderful clear sound in a vehicle until we bought this Sony Focus  I would really recommend this to anyone who loves music  all comes wrapped in a great vehicle The vehicle itself is very roomy  extremely comfortable in both front and back  and plenty of legroom too  The car handles and drives like a much more expensive vehicle  We had a 1997 Camry that did not ride or drive any where near as nice as the Focus  We got the Z Tec Engine as part of the Sport Group  and would say that would the engine i would recommend  It puts out 130 hp  and is plenty powerful for 4 Adults in the car  and even on hilly terrain  The only bad thing about the car is the poorly designed and placed cupholders  They sit on either side and in front of the Gear Shift Lever  This leaves little room to reach a cup  and is very limiting to size of cup as well  Not a huge issue to an otherwise Great Little Car  It was also announced this week  that the Focus is top selling car in the world  To go along with all the awards  all I have to say is watch out Toyota and Honda  here comes the Ford Focus br br
