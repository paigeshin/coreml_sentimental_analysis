 We purchased a use 1996 Taurus LX earlier this year  Now  I like the car  Don t get me wrong  I just feel like a little old lady every time I get into it  It reminds me of my grandmother  who has always driven a Ford  Since my husband is 4 years older than me I ll give him a break  The Taurus LX is the most luxurious car I ve ever driven  but then I ve only driven fun cars like Trackers and Eclipses  This vehicle is power everything  It s an automatic  I m still young enough to love a stick shift  The seats are the epitome of comfort who wants to fall asleep when their driving  It handles beautifully  there is a bare minimum of bumps in the road give me my tracker any day  I love bouncing down the road  It is very spacious  lot s of room for groceries or bodies depending on your hobbies  Overall it s very comfortable  In about 5 years when my husband goes through his midlife crisis and buys that red convertible sports car  I guess I will be ready to settle down into a nice old lady car  It s nice to know it will be here waiting for me  I just hope it doesn t come to soon br br
