 I just purchased a Ford Contour LX  It is a 1999 model  and cost  11 500  I got a great deal considering their was only 9 000 miles on it  At first I was somewhat hesitent to test drive it because it was an automatic  and I usually hate automatics  But after just driving around the block  I was sold  I was amazed at what a great car you can get for so little  I looked at the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camary  but they were both overpriced  The Contour was not only thousands cheaper  but I actually thought it drove nicer than the other two  The in dash CD player produced a sound that make the Camary s radio look like a alarm clock in comparison  The only two complaints I have about the Contour are small  One is that when you pop the trunk  it is a little heavy to lift  Two is that the cup holders are positioned a little too far away from the driver  Two inconviences yes  but not enough to deter a sensible buyer away from this great buy br br
