 I own a  97 Explorer XLT that s in the body shop for two weeks  The other guy s insurance company is renting a new Explorer XLT for me until mine is done   CHECK OUT MY REVIEW OF THE  97 MODEL    Life with Explorer  All I can say is  I m impressed Ford has the good sense to be content with minor tweakings of the very popular Explorer  This latest incarnation of the XLT version is certainly evolutionary  but not revolutionary compared to my middle aged  97 model The outside stylings are more angular  with a front face that looks modern  yet also is somewhat reminiscent of the  Aero era  headlight design that almost all Ford cars had in the late  80s  particularly the T Bird and Mustang The model I m driving has spotlamps in the bottom of the outside mirrors  When the doors are unlocked with the key fob  these outside lights   along with the interior dome lights  turn on The first thing I noticed when entering the vehicle  is the redesigned door handles  They no longer pull up  rather the whole handle pulls straight out  sort of like an old latch refridgerator  The keyless entry keypad is now arranged vertically on the door  aft of the window  On the inside  the door locks are no longer stalks on the top rear of the door  but are now toggle switches near the inside latch handles The mirror controls threw me for a moment  rather than the slide selector  you now turn a knob to select which mirror to adjust  The tilt wheel adjustment is a fiasco  and so far the only thing I don t like about the  02  It s a large lever that must be turned 90 degrees to adjust the steering wheel  and must be manually returned to the starting position before exiting the vehicle  or else you bang your knees on it on the way out The radio  CD  A C controls are very similar to what I m used to  The dashboard  while still functional  clean and uncluttered  uses an odd  italic  font that I don t like as well as what I m used to  but that s purely subjective There are better cupholders  and handy bin for fries or sunglasses or a cellphone in front of the cavernous bread box of an arm rest bin  There is a power outlet in front of the bin  which helps keep phone charger cords out of the way  There is also a power outlet in back  for the kid s CD players   Gameboys  The tissue dispenser had been eliminated  but a large clip is on the underside of the bin lid to hold the tissue box there  It s easier to change tissue boxes  but not as easy to access the tissues when driving  For those of us with small kids  that makes a difference  to the rest of you it s probably not anything to write home about The outside temp and compass have been moved from an overhead display to a small display that s part of the electronic odometer  It seems this has eliminated the tendency of the old design to register higher than the actual outside temp on very hot days  This was due to the old design s thermometer being influenced by cabin heat The rear storage area has more useable floor space  because the rear wheel wells are not as intrusive compared to older Explorers  Also  the retractable cover is situated higher  allowing room for taller objects to be carried and still remain hidden under the cover  It appears the tailgate window no longer opens independently from the rest of the gate  I found the ability to just open the window very handy  especially when loading groceries I have not attempted to use the rear seat  although just knowing it s there is nice  There are occasions when seating for five is inadequate  It s a nice option for those of us who dread a minivan  especially if seating for five is adequate more than 75  of the time The model I m renting has a V 8 engine   which provides plenty of ZIP from a both a dead stop and for freeway passing power  My truck has the big V 6 and while it s acceleration is not bad  it s clearly not in the same league as the new model  The engine runs quietly  and the transmission shifts smoothly  when it should  The 4WD drive system retains the  Auto   High   Lo  selector  although it has changed from a dial to a three push button arrangement The ride is much more car like than in my  97  There are fewer bounces and it s relatively quiet  There is some roll when cornering sharply  but that s normal for truck based SUV
