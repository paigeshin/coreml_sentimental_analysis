 For 10 years I owned a Jeep Wrangler and I loved everything about it  Then I got married and we had twins a couple of years later  Well  the old Jeep wasn t gonna hold all the baby things that come along with the babies  so we went looking for something else  It seemed to me that the choices were a mini van or an SUV  I just couldn t go from a Jeep to a mini van  There would have been way to much therapy involved  As we looked at the SUV s on the market I noticed that the Ford Explorer  and others like it  were nothing more than a large sedan with a really tall trunk  We would still have to take two vehicles if we wanted to go somewhere with our kids and other friends and family  The Expedition provided just the right mix  It holds all our kids stuff  is easy to get in and out of  handles extremely well  this baby will turn on a dime  and still allows us to take our kids and our folks out to dinner in the same vehicle  I have taken it off road on many occasions and have only minor complaints about its abilities there  It s easy enough for my little wife to drive and it fits into my garage  A fairly amazing feat with the size of garages being built these days  but that s for another review  Bottom line is it is easy to drive  holds lots of stuff  and fits in the garage  Sure the gas mileage really blows  but it s a small sacrifice for the comfort I get  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs space  comfort  reliability and something more manly than a mini van br br
