 I bought my Ford Focus 2000 SE Sony Edition as a new leftover about a month ago  and I am extremely pleased with it  I bought it to replace my Ford Escort SE  which was a decent car  but nowhere near as fun as the Focus  I have also previously owned a 1990 Subaru Loyale  which felt like an old lady car  and a 1993 Mitsubishi Eclipse  which was not a very good car  but there was some fun to it  and I like the Focus by far the best First  handling and driving  I have seen a few opinions that say that this car is not quite as peppy as the writers  expectations  I disagree  I have a bit of a lead foot  and I find that the car does quite well at higher speeds  I live in Philadelphia  and travel on Interstate 95 daily  and you have to be able to drive between 75 and 80 mph to keep up  It doesn t take the car long to get to those speeds  mine is a 5 speed manual Z Tec engine  and the car performs very well with no shimmying or shaking  The ride is extremely smooth for a small car  and pot holes and bumps are barely noticeable  which in Philadelphia is almost an impossibility  Second  features  Granted  my model is a much more  packed  model than most of the other Focuses  or is it Foci  due to the fact that it is a special edition  but I don t feel that I paid an exorbitant amount for the features I got  My model has all leather seats  all electric  windows  mirrors  etc  sport package  spoiler and wheels  and of course the Sony XPlode stereo   speaker package  All of these amenities are easily accessible to the driver without much reaching  due not only to the fact that it is a small car and the instrument panel is not far from you  but also to the fact that the interior engineering is  in a word  terrific  I am not sure how the features compare on the base model  but I would say that if you are going to buy this car  go for the features  because for the small expense  you will find that they really are worth it Third  design  This car is designed very well  It is slightly wider and longer than the Escort  it would probably be more appropriate to compare it to the Contour  but I don t have much experience with that particular car  but the car is MUCH higher  The additional height makes for a much more comfortable ride for taller drivers  I m 6 2  because your legs don t get all cramped up underneath the dash  It also provides additional head room  of which I am not accustomed  There is at least a good 3  between the top of my head and the ceiling  and for me that is a definite plus  The seats are adjustable up and down  so I m certain that shorter drivers will get as much enjoyment out of this car as taller  And lets face it  the car actually looks pretty good  I have read the biographies on the engineering of this car  and it was mostly designed in Europe  The sleeker design and headlight placement give this car a little more personality than its predecessors the Escort and Contour  Passengers that have ridden in the back seat have commented that it is surprisingly comfortable for a small car  and the rear leg room was much more than expected Forth  it s a Ford  For a while  Ford was a bit of a punchline  FORD   Fix Or Repair Daily  or Found On Road Dead  but in the last 5 or so years  they have really changed things around  The redesign of the Escort  Tempo  which essentially became the Contour  and Taurus in the 1997 model year went very well  my Escort required NO major repairs   I never even had to get tires on it after 4 years and 70 000  miles  and from what I m reading  the Focus takes even further steps in being a maintenance free car In short  I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller  but really not too small  that is fun to drive
