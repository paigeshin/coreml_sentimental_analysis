 First off let me say the Mustang is one fun car to drive  I have read every review of this car  and I have to say that people are buying this car for the wrong reason  If your looking for performance  then buy the GT  Cobra  or Saleen  You cant buy a 6cyl and complain that it doesn t drive like a GT  Example  you wouldn t buy a Jeep without 4x4  Buying this car one has to keep in mind that this car is for fun and speed  It is not for hauling or transporting people long distances  Now with that said  on to my experiences  I recently purchased a 1998 Mustang Gt Convertible  I haven t owned a new car in over 10 years and I was ready  After many discussions with the wife  she recommened the Mustang  I have always thought that is was a cool looking car  but I really knew nothing about it  So the search begins  I got everything I wanted except a manual transmission  I believe that a sports car should have this so you can control the throttle  But I ended up changing my mind and I don t regret my decision at all now I can hold my coffee and drive I own a Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel  Chevy Venture Van so I wanted a play car  The car stock car is very quick  Handling is excellent and road noise with the convertible is minimal  Again if you don t want to hear the road don t buy the Conv  The cockpit is designed perfect for driving this car  Even though it has seats in the back  in my opinion its a two seater  My kis however can fit back there now but the older they get the more cramped it will be  Longer leg people might not like driving this car  I m 6 2  and with the seat all the way back  I just barely make it  So test drive one before you buy  The day we bought it the wife and I were going skiing  The total mileage was around 410 miles  I got awesome gas mileage and we weren t fatigued from driving the car  The sound system is awesome  This is one stock stereo system that is not getting taken out  The upgraded rims and tires are sweet  but will be pricey for replacement  My tires can not be rotated because they are directional tires  but I accept that  If you left this car stock  you would always have a fast sports car for a great price  But if your like me you can modify it to you taste s the mod bug has bitten me On a scale of 1 10 I give this a 9 Have fun
