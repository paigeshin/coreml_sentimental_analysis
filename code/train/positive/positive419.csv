 This card provides a strong handling of the road and can work for the driver but if regular maintenance isn t maintained on this automobile it falls apart  This car takes constant care and is an asset to the buyer based on the look but can easily become a pocket drain  When you first get this car Ford generally sends a package that is very impressive  books and or memorabilia but remember this costs money and the company gets it from the price of the car  So decide if you want to pay for the looks and repairs  I have enjoyed the car but not the maintenance
