 Are you contemplating the Mustang  I know I know  it is a Ford  But  if you can get past that you won t be sorry The only model I can write about is the GT Convertible  loaded  In my never humble opinion it is the only way to go  Now we will assume that you are  a over the age of twenty five and  b under the age of fifty  otherwise your insurance bill will exceed Sadam Hussein s hooker tab or you are too old to be seen in such a I hope I don t look too old kind of car This car is not cheap but it does move  It is not a stealthy car  can you say highway patrol trooper but chics like  em  It doesn t get thirty miles to the gallon but the fuel tank holds plenty  You won t want to drive on go out with your buds night but for just you or one companion it can t be beat There is no equal for this car in speed and handling for the money  And you may even find that the famous Ford reputation for unreliable poorly screwed together vehicles does not apply to the Mustang  And  by the way  this is by no means a limited production car  they build a zillion of them so you can strike a hard bargain
