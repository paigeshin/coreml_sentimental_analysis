 I picked up a 1997 Taurus SHO after looking over several  quot sporty quot  four door sedans  The car is very refined for a Ford  Almost everything in the car is improved or updated over the V6 Taurii  It has SHO specific engine  brakes  transmission  steering  upholstery  the list goes on Ford did not market the SHO very well  They are hard to sell  For this reason  new SHO s can be found at the dealer for thousands under MSRP Positives The car is a performer  It is not a stoplight racer so much as it is an executive cruiser  It has the brakes and suspension to keep up with the motor  but not at the expense of a comfortable ride It has been 100  reliable since the day I bought it  It is the most trustworthy car I ve ever owned Good ergonomics  One could drive this car for hours on end with little driving fatigue Negatives The styling is definitely love it or hate it  The V8 is thirsty  Frisky drivers can expect no better than 15 mpg in the city The oval shaped stereo   climate controls make it nearly impossible to upgrade the sound system br br
