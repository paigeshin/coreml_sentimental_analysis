 Weve had our 2002 Ford Taurus SEL for about 3 months  and have driven it about 3500 miles  with no unscheduled maintenance  Our Taurus cost us  23 400 without rebates and tax licensing fees applied  It is chockfull with options  everything from ABS  Traction Control to illuminated visors  electronic climate control  24 valve 3 0 L Duratec engine  to leather seating and illuminated perimeter lighting systems  to name a few  We continue to be impressed by its road manners  comfort  ambience and thoughtfully laid out interior  Though some door panels are of lower quality  the price point compensates greatly for the shortcomings  A similiarly equipped 2002 Camry would have set us back atleast  28 000  minus the rebates  of which there arnt many  Overall  brakes   good  could be a tad better  transmission   Excellent  value  excellent  and the overall identity of the Taurus is excellent Wed definitely recommend a Taurus  particularly because of the outstanding customer service weve received at the Ford Customer Relationship Center  1 800 241 3673  and because of the overall quality  performance and comfort of this vehicle
