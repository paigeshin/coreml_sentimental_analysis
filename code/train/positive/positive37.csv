 In normal everyday life  I drive a Volvo S70  While working  I drive my Crown Victoria  This is a very nice car and I have had it since new  It is very comfortable  and I love the color it s Dark Green a k a   quot Willow quot  I was given this car for work as my Buick Park Avenue Ultra was totalled  I liked the Park Avenue because the dashboard doubled as a M amp M dispenser on long trips  The Crown Vic is great for prolonged surveillance operations The gas mileage is poor and the power is lackluster  however  I convinced my employer to designate funds to make a couple of changes  A 2 chamber flowmaster dual exhaust was installed  very quiet  underdrive pulleys  hypertech chip and a K amp N Air Filter  These have made a remarkable improvement and has deleted the 110 MPH engine cutoff  I got the 1995 model  which has the updated transmission and new interior  that like of a 2000 model  Very good ergonomics There were a few problems with the car that are typical with any 92  Crown Vic  The tranny needed to be tuned up at 60K Miles  100  at 65K  the  quot Check Engine quot  light illuminated  which 99  of the time indicates that your EGR passage in the intake manifold is carboned up  125  and at the same time  the horn button discentigrated  50  New tires at 70K and Front brakes at 85K  All prices were at the Dealership out of warranty  parts  amp  labor  No problems during warranty This vehicle is nearing 92 000 miles and will be decomissioned at 100K  I hope to god that I will get another one Who should buy this  If you have a big family  I have had 11 people in this car once  live in your car  or travel a lot for work this is the car  Amazingly  it is very easy to park  it has been shot at three times and all three bullets missed so  it is not as big as it looks  If you love rear drive performance at a good price  look no further  My next car  2001 Crown Victoria br br
