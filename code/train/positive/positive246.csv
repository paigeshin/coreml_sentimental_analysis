 My present car passed away one night on the way to work and my wife and I needed a another car van to replace it  I was always interested in the Aerostar as our friends have them  With 11 year old triplets we needed a van to hold all of us  The seven passenger van was just the ticket for us  We purchased a 91 used in March 2000 and so far no major problems save for having to replace the sliding door track at a cost of  200 00 including labour  My wife and I love the fan The 7 passenger seating is great  it allows us to separate the girls so they won quot t fight on long trips  We highly recommend this van  Anyone with a large family would benefit from this van p s  this van has 230 000 kilometers on it and it still purrs like a kitten has the pickup of a new van br br
