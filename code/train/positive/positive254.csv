 I own a 1995 Ford Aspire base model 2 door hatchback with air  cassette  and the standard transmission  I purchased it recently for a very low price because it had been previously wrecked  This car is however in excellent condition for a 5 year old mini with 75 000 miles I ll be honest  most people would probably hate this as a used car  It has several  quot where the heck is that coming from quot  rattles  buzzes  and clunks  It used to vibrate at higher speeds because the tires were a cheap off brand  Michelin Weatherhandlers fixed that problem  This particular Aspire  having been previously wrecked  probably will not last much longer  but for right now it is doing me just fine as a courier delivery vehicle  There is plenty of room for cargo and the rear seat not only folds down but flips up against the front seats to provide a flat cargo floor  It is fully carpeted  too This car always starts right up and runs smoothly  does not smoke or knock  and has enough power for me  Some people might say this car is underpowered  For these folks  do not worry  Most 1 6 and 1 8 liter Mazda engines will bolt in with little modification  as will the better geared Mazda transmissions  I have been averaging an honest 35 mpg with this car under hard driving in Dallas  Texas with the AC running about 75  of the time  Having no power steering is only a chore during parallel parking  which I have to do little of because most of my deliveries go to businesses I have learned that keeping the tires inflated properly will keep the steering light above a crawling speed  The brake rotors are warped now  I am sure turning them will help at least for a little while  The only major problem I foresee with this car is the clutch  it is slipping slightly when I drive harder  but if I take it easy  it shifts and engages fine  The shifter is rubbery  but if you are gentle with it  it will slip right into and out of gear  The rougher you treat it  the tougher it is to get it to shift  I would say this car is not the best for long trips  I have a Buick Century for those  But to do the basic point A to B to C to D of courier work  this car is okay  I used to own a Geo Metro and this car is a welcome change  not necessarily better  but it is different br br
