 I took a Ford Sport Trac for a test drive I really like the practicality of the design I am considering the Leather group option as well as the sun roof option The only consideration with the sun roof is the loss of head room I think the price is moderate but I m sure there is room for negotiation To like this vehicle is a personal taste but I think it is very innovative and well thought out Reliability may be another issue but if it is anything like the regular explorer it should be fine I would expect this vehicle to sell well because it serves two purposes The truck buyer and the SUV buyer could both enjoy it To me it is the best of both worlds It may be tricky to get options though In the brochure there is more than one picture of bicycles with the forks of the bicycle attached to a bar that runs across the bed of the truck I have enquired at the dealership about this option and they are not sure about how much it is and when it would be available This option I would serious consider because one of the main purposes for me to purchase the truck would be to transport my bicycles br br
