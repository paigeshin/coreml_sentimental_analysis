 My first car was a 1967 Mustang  289 cu in automatic with turn signals on the hood and a black vinyl roof over yellow paint job  Today this car would be the ultimate classic ride  Now in the nineties  I have owned three new Mustang s  95  97  99  and I believe that Ford is on the right track to making me as happy as the first one  The body style of the 1999 s is quite a bit different from the other two  With a rounder body and square like head  amp  tail lights this is more like a Toyota body style If I had a dollar for every person that told me   quot I love your car quot  or  quot cool car  man quot  it probably would be enough to make one of the payments  All three of these vehicles were five speed transmission s because I just love to drive  Living out in the hill country of Texas  not far from IH 10 it is easy to get down the road and make it to one of the big cities  Never had a bit of trouble with any of these vehicles and I easily put 4 to 5 thousand miles a year on the first two  With the MachI CD stereo system the road becomes a joy to own  The 95 was not a GT and the difference is quite noticeable during acceleration  I would recommend the 4 liter over the 3 liter engine if you do a lot of highway driving  One thing you may have to get used to is other  quot sporty quot  cars pulling alongside and begging you to have a race  This takes a little getting used to especially when most of the time it would be no problem to blow their doors off  Take a walk on the wild side with a new Ford Mustang Ford also sent me a fantastic gift package containing a three cd set of music from the 60 s  70 s  amp  80 s and a wonderful black leather mustang cd case as well as a hard cover edition of the  quot History of Mustang quot  Try and beat this deal br br
