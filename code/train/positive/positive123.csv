 The Ford Contour was introduced as a 1994 model and was Ford s first attempt at building a world car  The Contour was designed and built in Europe and is sold there as the Ford Mondeo What model is the best to buy When I was shopping for my car I drove several different models of the Contour  I tried a 4 cylinder automatic  a V 6 automatic  and a V 6 manual  I also tried the base and sport models  The best model is easily the V 6 mated to the 5 speed manual  However  if you prefer automatics that transmission is a good choice too  It never lets the engine strain and always chooses the right gear quickly and smoothly Performance This car s performance is the most convincing reason to buy it  The sport model s wide low profile tires have superb grip  The car s suspension holds the car down great and it definitely has a European handling flair  The front disc rear drum brakes are excellent and have a great feel to them  The suspension of the V 6 model is definitely stiffer than the base model  though it never feels like your riding in a sports car either  The V 6 engine is far smother than the four cylinder and has a great sound to it s exhaust  The 4 cylinder engine accelerates fairly well  but the V 6 is by far worth the extra money  Interior The interior is the only sore spot of this car  and especially in back  The front seats on the sports model are extremely comfortable and really hold you in place when the going get s rough  The dash was redesigned in 1998 and can still use work  The vent on the passenger s side is positioned awkwardly  and it is hard to get the air direction right  The lower part of the dash houses two very low and shallow cup holders  and a storage shelf that can barely hold a pen  The power window switches are mounted vertically on the door in a position that makes them hard to use  The rear seat is cramped but like the front seat it is very comfortable  The stereo sounds great but the buttons are small and many serve dual purposes that are hard to decipher  Other than those minor glitches the interior is definitely designed for driving and the driving position  seats  steering wheel  and climate control system are excellent Reliabilty Consumer s Reports rates the 1999 contour average  The V 6 is more prone to problems than the four  My friend receives a Contour as her company car and has had an electrical problem  and a recall on the engine mounts  Besides that she is very happy with the car  Overall Anyone in the market for a small car should definitely take a look at the Contour  If the Contour s interior proves to be a problem than take a look at the Mercury Mystique which is basically a Contour but sold by Mercury  The Mercury has a redesigned dash and interior which solve most of the Contour s problems  Why is nobody buying the Contour My guess is the interior  The rear is not sufficient for a family with older children  and the minor details done wrong on the inside affect a person s decision greatly  However  if you re looking for a fun to drive  comfortable  affordable alternative to a Corolla or Saturn the Contour is definitely the way to go
