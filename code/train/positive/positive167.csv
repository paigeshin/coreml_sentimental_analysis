 I love my 1995 Ford Explorer with automatic transmission and four wheel drive For one thing  the ride is smoother than the ride of the average truck  And I love the increased height of the vehicle   My Honda Civic is a great little car but I feel like I m dragging my butt on the ground in comparison In  quot Christopher quot   yes  I name my cars  the great explorer and protector  I can survey the road from a dominant position  Other drivers stay out of my way I m Canyon Woman   Queen of the Wild Frontier When it rains hard  we have many flood sites here in San Antonio  But I need not worry  If that sedan in front of me can make it through the water  I ve got it made  I m Canyon Woman   Queen of the Wild Frontier When I go shopping for small furniture  I need not hire a mover  I m tough and able to carry my own purchase  I m well  you know In case of deep snow  well  it COULD happen even here in South Texas  I m ready  Rough terrain is my Christopher s forte  I love my power seat package and plan to buy the equivalent in any future vehicle  The ability to fine tune the seat position makes a significant difference in driver and passenger comfort Air conditioner heater controls for back seat passengers greatly increase their comfort The V6 engine is the perfect blend of power  yet economy  The extra wide cargo space is home to furry pups as well as bricks and garden supplies you name it My only error in choosing this vehicle was in the color  The  quot Mocha Frost quot   okay TAN  exterior looks exactly like 40  of the other Explorers on the road  I often approach a look alike in the parking lot  wondering why my  quot clicker quot  isn t working to unlock the door  Also  the tan interior shows dirt far worse than my previous vehicle with a gray interior The left turn signal seems a little glitchy  often turning itself off before I get to the turn  My friend s Explorer does the same thing I had warranty work done to fix a problem with the column shift when Christopher was new  The service was problem free After five years my only service expenses have been for routine maintenance I love to take my Explorer out on the road after a good wash and wax with tires gleaming and the radio blasting  okay  so I listen to talk radio and my hearing s not as good as it used to be I m Canyon Woman Queen of the Wild Frontier br br
