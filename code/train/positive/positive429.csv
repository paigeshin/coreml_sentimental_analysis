 We chose this truck because it was an upgrade of our previous Ranger  You can tell we are  quot Ford people quot  We wanted a dependable truck which would out live the loan payments  Seven years and 100 000 miles later  it looks and drives as good as any of the newer models on the busy city streets and long Texas highways  The body shows no signs of deterioration and the engine still purrs little a kitten  It was bought without the automatic windows and doors for longevity  This was the correct choice since many of the automatic windows and doors fail long before seven years  We have had no major defects other than an oil pan leak caused by a bad gasket which proved to be costly since it required the removal of the transmission to get to the gasket to be replaced  Another short coming was the windshield wipers which were under designed  too small  for the truck which leaves areas of the windows which are not cleaned properly We intend to keep this truck for another three to four years or 200 000 miles which it will have no problem reaching  Then we will most likely choose another F150 or upgrade to one of those three door cabs  This vehicle is not for everyone  People who are under 5 feet tall  over 75 years of age should not buy this truck unless they have a step stool  If you are looking for a truck that is dependable  low maintenance and fits in your budget  try it you will like it
