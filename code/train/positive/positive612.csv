 When I went out looking for a vehicle I had the price and how long the car would last in mind  Price was comparable with other makes and models so I checked on the length of time it would last  People I had talked to who owned them had nothing but good things to say about the long lasting motor and body  That to me was a plus  It is comfortable unless you go on a very lengthy trip then the driver side seat tends to get uncomfortable  After driving the vehicle to work for quite sometime I found it was very good on gas  I drive an estimated 25 miles to work 6 days a week so on an average I drive 300 miles a week and fill my gas tank once  The car handles very well in the winter  I live close to the snow belt here in Michigan so I need something dependable  The bigger vehicles just don t make me feel as safe as driving smaller vehicles  I feel as though I have more control over my actions and I have found this particularly comforting with this vehicle We have for the first snow falls this year parked a 4x4 truck we own and drove the escort solely since the truck was all over the road  The escort went without a problem The things I can say I tend to hate about the vehicle is that you can only have three beverages in the car with only three cup holders  That are also small and the two front ones are too close to the dash so only short cups will fit  Sitting in the back seat is uncomfortable if you have a tall person sitting in front  The seats crack and creek when a heavier set person sits in front so I feel as though they aren t built as solidly Overall I would say this is a very economical vehicle worth the money if you are looking for something mechanically well built  Unfortunately for the taller and well built man this would not be the type vehicle to own  If you are a smoker sadly you must pay an extra charge for an ashtray the size of a tennis ball and only one per vehicle br br
