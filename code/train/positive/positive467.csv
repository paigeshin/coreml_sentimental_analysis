 Okay  I ll admit it  I used to be a mom in a mini van  and now I ve become something even more dreaded  a mom in a big  horkin  Expedition But guess what  This car is a dream car  not only because it s comfortable and it drives well  but also because whenever I drive it  other people in itty bitty cars actually move out of my way Maybe it s the way I weave precariously in and out of lanes  or maybe it s just because I m in a car that s large enough to run down a Tercel and barely leave a mark  Whatever  I love being the biggest car in the carpool lane  I love the way my window aligns with the McDonald s drive through window just right  And I love that I m surrounded by what feels like tons of ice green steel My kids are safe  I m safe  and what else can I say  I m BIG br br
