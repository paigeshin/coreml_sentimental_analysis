 I had never considered buying the Ford Contour SVT  but I happened to see one at the dealership  I thought   quot I can t afford that quot  But after looking at the sticker and the markdown sticker  I seriously considered it As part of a former job  I have driven quite a few cars  I would have to say at least 100 different models  Honda  Accord  Civic  Prelude  Chevy  Cavalier  Beretta  Camaro  Monte Carlo  VW  Golf  GTI  VR6  Jetta  Passat  Pontiac  Sunfire  Grand Am  Acura  Integra  Ford  Mustang  Taurus  Escort  BMWs  Audis  Volvos  Mercedes  Lexus  Many SUVs  Etc I test drove the SVT and IMMEDIATELY knew this was the car for me PROS Power  V6  200hp  2 5 liter DOHC  Made by the same guys who make the Ford Mustang Cobra  Wow  great mid range and high end power Exhaust  The sweet tone is like no other  Really reflects the power of this car Handling  It outhandles any car in it s price range hands down  Even better than cars around  30k such as the BMW and Audi  Sticks to the roads and carves the twisties Short clutch  many 5 speeds  such as the Mustang  have a clutch that s really high  The SVT was the perfect height Loaded car  moonroof  leather  power windows  doorlocks  amp  seats  keyless entry  amp  trunk release  for lights  16 quot  alloy wheels  z rated tires Huge trunk  actually is a little too big   should have made the back seat bigger Euro styling and feel to the car CONS Road noise  at high speeds Back seat  Way too cramped Quality  the interior plastic and parts seem kind of cheap I have just passed the recommended 1000 mile break in period  somewhat babying it  I have opened it up since then and am completely addicted  The SVT begs to be redlined and the exhaust makes it that much more difficult  Winding roads are a blast to cruise on SVT has done a wonderful job with this car  It s too bad it s to be discontinued after the 2000 production year I would highly recommend anyone looking for a  22k ish car to check this bad boy out br br
