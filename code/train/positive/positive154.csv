 We recently purchased the 2000 Ranger trail head  We haven t seen any on the street since we bought ours  I feel it isn t getting enough publicity The new Ranger Trailhead has a similar package to the 4 x4 big guys  with it s 16 quot  wheel base and high suspension  From the first look to the last you will mistake this new Trailhead for a 4x4 truck It however does not ride like any ordinary truck we ve driven before  It is quiet and comfortable  Get down to your Ford dealer right away and test drive this sporty and definately great looking Pick Up
