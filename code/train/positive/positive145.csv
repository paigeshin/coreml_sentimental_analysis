 My  93 Ford Ranger is a great truck to own  It has over 90 000 miles on it  is running great  and has had no major repairs or service done on it other than regularly scheduled tune ups and replacing the tires  Although hard core off roaders might prefer the 4WD model  unless you live in the outback the 2WD is much more practical and economical  The engine is a large straight 4 cylinder with decent power and it shows no signs of needing any repairs any time soon  It has had no problems towing small camping trailers or being heavily loaded with items like pianos and couches when I helped my uncle and aunt move  and so it s a very practical truck to have  Plus  it s not as large and unwieldy as most other pickups that are a pain to park or that you would worry a lot about in underground parking  I enjoy driving it  but I try to keep too many people from finding out that I own it or I end up having to help people move all the time  I guess that just comes with the territory in owning a pickup truck My only complaints are 1  It could use a little more power for the big hills I live in a mountainous area so it would be nice to still be able to accelerate up those steep hills rather than just maintaining my speed  but like I said  it has decent power  2  I wouldn t mind a little more passenger space at the expense of a little cargo room  but then again  I m 6 7  so it should be fine for most people As far as towing and hauling  this truck actually rides better when it s loaded down  If you do want the extra power  at the expense of a little gas mileage  go for the V6 model rather than the 4 cylinder  It just depends on your needs preferences
