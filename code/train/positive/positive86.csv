 When we were faced with buying a bigger vehicle suitable for transporting more people  my husband wouldn t consider anything other than an Expedition  He s wanted one since they came out in 1997  His wish finally came true  In late February  2000  we bought a 98 Eddie Bauer I m trying to  I really want to like it but I m going to tell you about our experiences in the 2 shorts months we ve had it  I hope this isn t an indication of what s to come Our timing could have been better in buying this vehicle  We found it bought it on a Saturday and the interest rates went up the previous Monday  Need I mention the price of gas  Okay both of these are nobody s fault I ll start with the positive  The main thing I like is it gives you a commanding view of the road sitting up so high  I LOVE the fact that the doors automatically lock when put in gear  Since I have small children  I appreciate the child proof lock option I do not think it s hard to maneuver but I am used to big cars The temperature controls and radio controls for the back are nice A neutral point small children or shorter adults are the only ones comfortable in the third seat  The middle back is very roomy and comfortable  The back  quot hatch quot  if you will  is kind of hard and heavy to put down Observation the further back you sit  the bouncier it gets Now for our negative experiences  First  the third seat didn t come out as easily as we were told or as the owner s manual indicated  My husband ended up having to use some tools to undo something  I don t know  I wasn t here when he did it I wish there was more room behind the third seat and the door We hadn t had this vehicle for 2 weeks when I put the back window  right back door  down and it wouldn t go back up  We live 3 hours from the dealership where we bought it  We got it fixed locally and they reimbursed us Two weeks later  on a Monday  I m on my way home from taking kids to preschool when the  quot check engine quot  light came on  I couldn t get it in to the local shop until Wednesday   60 later we found out that my husband didn t put the gas cap on properly after getting gas  Since the gas cap wasn t on correctly  it was emitting illegal emissions  thus triggering the  quot check engine quot  light  The only way they can figure this out is by hooking it up to their computer wherein they get the error code  Even if we knew the gas cap wasn t on properly upon seeing the  quot check engine quot  light  the mechanic told me that it would not automatically go off once it had been tripped  it had to be reset by a mechanic  Okay  so why doesn t Ford put a  quot gas cap quot  warning light on your dash or something instead of having to go through all of this  I let my husband get gas once in the fourteen years we ve been married and he can t even do that right  I ve taken his keys away So this vehicle has made two trips to the shop before we made our first payment  I m not sure how to answer the reliability question since we haven t owned it all that long and the two trips to the shop haven t really been engine related When I have a full vehicle while making the  quot preschool run quot  I feel like a bus  That s what the kids call it and the teacher commented that it was a pretty nice bus  I ve never ridden on a school bus as nice
