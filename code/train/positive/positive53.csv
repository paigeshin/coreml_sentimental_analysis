 The truck I purchased and am reviewing is a 2002 Ford F 150 Supercrew with the  FX4 Offroad  package new for 2002 I love this truck  If you think about it  when was the last time you were able to pull over at a garage sale with you and three people loaded into your SUV  buy that large enlongated oversized treasure you just had to have  and stuff it into the rear  Only to have to drive home in icy conditions Well  this hasn t happened to me yet here in Southern California  but who knows The point is  when I first saw the Supercrew a few years ago  I fell in love with the concept  I could still do somewhat oversized hauling  and at the same time fit one   two   three   four   five   or even six people into the cabin  and still have headroom  To me  the Supercrew exceeds the practicality of  and in itself is a superior SUV The short 5 6  bed is questionable for any type of tradesman  Since I won t be using it as a work truck  it suits me very well  Mine came with a  cargo cage   bed extender  and will haul my surfboards very handily  The model I purchased has the 5 4L Triton V8 motor  I find it to have more than enough power  It sounds like a big V8 during acceleration and quiets down nicely when up to speed and cruising  Of course it also likes to drink its lions share of gasoline  I m not sure what the mileage is  but I don t think I ll expect anything better than 14 mpg on the highway  even with the 3 55 limited slip rear end It s equipped with an automatic transmission  and shift  on the fly  4x4 transfer case  I can engage 4 wheel drive from the dash while driving less than 55 mph The FX4 Offroad package upgrades the Supercrew for individuals who like aggressive four wheeling  It includes skid plates beneath the transfer case  gas tank  and front axle assembly  They lifted the truck  tastefully  and stiffened the suspension with heavy duty shocks  It also includes 17 inch aluminum five spoke alloys  with Goodyear AT S LT 265 70 tires  They also throw in stainless steel lug nuts  To finish the FX4 package off  they include a red  FX4 Offroad  decal  two tone paint  and a matching red decal stripe separating the two tones of paint  FMC must be trying to attract sportier  younger buyers Personally  I m not into the offroad thing  I m looking to buy some acreage with incline  and I do like to go skiing  So this big heavy 4WD without the leather interior will do me fine Downsides 1  The vertical size is such that I wont be able to fit it into my garage if I decide to install any type of rack system 2  It gets very poor gas mileage  so for those who commute unless money grows out of your pockets  it doesn t lend itself to becoming a daily driver 3  Being a non traditional SUV  it s missing a third row of seats  and luggage storage is a problem on trips unless you enclose the bed Overall the truck lives up to the image that Ford creates with their  big truck built tough  advertising strategies  It drives with surprising comfort considering it has the offroad suspension  and doesn t drift like aftermarket lift kits tend to do Since it s new  dependability has yet to prove itself I also purchased a 2002 Thunderbird on the same day  If you would like to read its review  you can copy and paste   a href content 51622219396 http www epinions com content 51622219396 a Good luck and happy driving
