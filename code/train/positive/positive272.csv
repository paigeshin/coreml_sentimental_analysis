 I bought My 1997 ranger not knowing a whole lot about trucks in general  and was pleasantly surprised with the test drive  It handles and accelerates fine  and is very handy when moving furniture and crates from place to place though I m guilty of not getting regular oil changes  I haven t had any mechanical problems  all of the instruments are easy to reach and operate  and the air conditioner will freeze most anyone  The cold missouri winters aren t a problem either  the cab is usually too hot over a long period of time  Be forewarned  please purchase the 4 wheel drive option  If you live ANYWHERE where the roads tend to ice up  kansas city  YOU WILL need it  I have to pile a minimum of five 35 lbs sandbags in the bed to have any traction at all  this is my only regret  and will buy another Ranger with that option when this one is paid for  Another problem is portions of Missouri roads are horrific  and I have potholes memorized for my route to from work  due to the fact that I have nearly lost control after hitting uneven patches of highway in my ranger  If the patches are unavoidable  the only option is to get off of the gas pedal  and ride out the turbulence  this is a small problem  at least for me  because the bad roads are only in particular areas  I can t fault Ford for Missouri s bad highway maintenance  so all in all  I m quite pleased with the Ranger
