 In dire need for a car to take to school with me in the fall  I was looking for something dependable since it s a 600 mile round trip  as well as affordable since  well  I don t have much money First  I test drove a Dodge Stratus  and thanks to  Epinions   I was able to see it would be nothing but a hassle and a money pit So  I re scoured the Classified section of my newspaper and saw that there was a   96 Ford Taurus GL  for  7995 available   quot Loaded quot  the ad read  so I called the guy and went to look at it  Surprised that the car only had 65K miles on it  I was thinking that this blue green beauty just might be a vehicular reality for me  I took it for a test drive  and this 3 0L V6 practically drove itself out of the parking lot  It just wanted to go  I was very pleased with the way it handled turns  acceleration  reversals  and noticed no palpable thumps or rattles which would indicate problem spots  The dealer made sure to mention that the rotors may have to be turned or replaced  and that I might feel a slight vibration when I break quite the courteous remark  no In seeing that I know nearly nothing about cars  in a technical sense  I sent my older brother to look at it  In beautiful shape  he agreed that it seemed to be an excellent deal  so I purchased it at  7 495 since I paid in cash This car handles like a  Grand Am  around tight turns even when the speedometer is pushing 40  Acceleration is no problem for this car as I have made it to 100 with ease  i I was just testing it i  The sound system is by Ford  but they do an excellent job  So far it is a clear  seamless system which features a detachable radio antennae so that when I go through a car wash  I won t lose my FM  Also  there are 2  extra  speakers in alignment with the side view mirrors  which further beautifies the sound  as it envelopes you even more   However   if you are looking to put in a new  stronger system with a CD player  mine just has AM FM cassette  you may not be able to because of the way the  Taurus b  radio face is set up  It is too big and basically encompasses the AC and heat control as well  so I am not aware whether or not a new system can be put in very easily  I have a feeling that you sacrifice performance for looks and convenience b LowDown  Overall  however  I love this car  An excellent ride  I feel extremely safe in all respects  The trunk is  deep   an especially important consideration for a college student such as myself  It is a very roomy car  and as a rather big person at 6 2 quot  210lbs  I have had no problem fitting comfortably  The power everything features of this car make it quite a pleasure to drive  and as for dependability  I consistently hear stories of historically pleased  Taurus  owners who praise its longevity  Try one today br br
