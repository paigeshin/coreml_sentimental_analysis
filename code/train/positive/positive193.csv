 I recently used a 2002 Ford Explorer XLT for a week and I really enjoyed driving it  The instruments and front passenger area is very well laid out  it drives very well and it has plenty of space for a wide variety of things  The cupholders and nic nac trays are easy to access and the stereo is easy to use and figure out  I don t really like having a third seat in this vehicle  as the seat seems kind of out of place  I would think if you haul around that many people  you probably need a suburban or an expedition  I would prefer a more level  and taller  storage area  With the third seat laid down  the storage area tilts down toward the tail of the vehicle and it seems a little awkward The model I drove had leather seats  a CD tape player and it had keyless entry  I like having keyless entry and I especially like the ability to open the back hatch with it  The leather was very new and it seems a little  tacky  but I am sure it will break in and smooth out  This vehicle seemed to have lots of options  cruise  leather  keyless PW  PDL  fog lights  thermometer and compass on the dash  but I would like to see heated seats  cold leather is the worst   I have heated leather in my 95 Pathfinder I found the explorer to handle very well in the rain and the steering cornering feels very smooth and manageable  The explorer also has a tight turning radius  which really helps around town  It turns considerably sharper than my Pathfinder  I don t know what wheel tire combinations you can get with the explorer  but it seemed like it wasn t really designed as an off road vehicle  Maybe bigger tires would help  It is more like a big station wagon that handles well and has 4WD for driving on snowy roads  My Pathfinder feels more like an off road truck and I enjoy using it on the back roads and in the woods  but I would be afraid to go to many of those places in the explorer Since I am one of the few people who actually use my SUV off roading  I would think the qualities that I don t like should attract a lot of  soccer mom  types who enjoy a stable ride with lots of room and excellent function My friend has a 97 explorer and I have to say that this new version drives better and is probably more versatile it s people hauling ability
