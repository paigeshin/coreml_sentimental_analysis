 In my opinion one of the better cars of 1999 would be the Ford Mustang  The new model Mustang contains a numerous amount of good characteristics  which  in my opinion  outweigh the seldom found negative qualities  The 1999 Mustang was given a change in body style from the previous year  which most people find very appealing  This car is ideal for any sports car lover on a tight budget  The new engine placed in the 1999 model gets 40 more horsepower than the previous year  which gives the V6 model Mustang a greater 0 60 than either of its leading competitors  the Pontiac Firebird or the Chevrolet Camaro  The Mustang even comes with more than average room in the front seats for sports cars  I myself am 6 2 quot  and in no way am I lacking in room  On the down side  like most sports cars who even have four seats  one would have to be around the age of ten to actually be comfortable in the rear seats of the car  The only negative comment that comes to my mind in my reflection of the year I have owned my Mustang is the relative easiness to lose traction on even semi wet roads  However  the optional traction control system for around  200 works great by quickly restoring traction to the vehicle after it begins to slip  The traction control system even comes equipped with an on off switch for those moments where a driver really wants to peel out at a stoplight  and show everyone around him that the Mustang is truly a great car br br
