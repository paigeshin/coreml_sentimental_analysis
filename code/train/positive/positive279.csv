 Sporty  sturdy  cute   that s what I thought when I first saw the Contour on the lot of my local  and thankfully  reputable  used car dealer  Overall  I have been very pleased with the gas mileage  drive ability and passenger room  Also  the car looks great and  feels  great  All of the buttons are reachable and the cup holders are a great feature Here are the issues 1  The trunk  It leaks  Granted  this may have been the result of an unreported collision by the car s first owner  However  it took me three trips to my local Ford dealer  the car was still under warranty  to fix the problem 2  The recalls  They re copious  Every other day I seem to get a friendly  but pointed letter asking me to bring the car back to a licensed Ford dealer for yet another tune up  While I genuinely appreciate Ford s commitment to their drivers  safety  I wish they would iron out these issues before the cars come to market  My mechanic and I are becoming best friends br br
