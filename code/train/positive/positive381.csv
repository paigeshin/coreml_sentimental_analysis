 I just want to say that I ve had my 1992 4x4 XLT fullsize Bronco for 4 years now and I love it  I couldn t ask for anything more in a vehicle  The first thing that sold me on it was the intimidating appearance of the thing  It looks mean  The interior is very roomy and comfortable and gauges and switches are clear and easy to reach  Currently it has 135 000 miles on it with not a lick of trouble  Everything on the Bronco is stock besides the 33 quot  tires and a Dynomax turbo muffler  The ride is decent for a truck like SUV  but the stiff suspension can really help out when off roading  The 5 0L powerplant is surprisingly powerful  I can beat my friend s stock Chevy Z71 0 60 even with my 33 quot  tires  although he hates when I bring it up  I don t see why people gripe and complain about the reliability of this vehicle  Me and about 8 of my other friends have gone over 120 000 miles on our Broncos  135 000 for me  without incident  I just think that some people don t know what the term  quot routine maintenance quot  means
