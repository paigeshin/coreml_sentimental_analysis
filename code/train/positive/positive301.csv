 We have had 2 Ford Windstars in the past 4 years  But we didn t trade in because of any problems  We traded it in to get a newer model and we are not sorry  We love our Windstar  The ride is superb and quiet  It is so comfortable to travel in  We ve been to Niagara Falls  Canada  Toronto and Montreal also  And we ve also done closer trips to Vermont  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  We are from Massachusetts  I have never had any problems to speak of with these vans and love the dependability of them  There s plenty of room for a family and cargo too  The seats are very comfortable  I happen to like Fords anyway  Haven t had any complaints in the 29 years we ve had them in our family  So I have good reason to stay with them  Our van also has the automatic sliding door in the right rear  We especially love that convenience  When you re bogged down with tons of shopping bags from a shopping day at the mall you really appreciate this feature
