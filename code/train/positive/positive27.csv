 On a tight budget after first getting married  my wife and I bought a brand new 1993 Ford Escort Wagon for  9 300  It came with A C  dual powered remote mirrors  manual transmission  roof rack and a cassette stereo Seven years and 93 000 miles later the car is still running great  It hasn t been  quot perfect quot  but what has gone wrong have been minor annoyances  see list at bottom of this epinion The car has lots of room for cargo  and the roll over cargo cover is great when you want to shade frozen groceries or just keep a passer by from looking into your car  The 60 40 split folding seats are life savers when taking trips to home depot Controls throughout the car are too small  Small radio buttons  with completely un intuitive radio clock settings  small fuel filler release lever  small climate control levers  Admittedly it is a small car  but I ve driven a Saturn and the controls were far larger One big problem were the original tires  After 30 000 miles the car started handling very poorly and I noticed the tires were wearing in an odd fashion  A mechanic thought the suspension was shot based on the wear of the tires  but a friend of ours said a good pair of tires fixed her problem  Sure enough  a pair of Goodyear Weatherhandlers and 60 000  miles later we have not had a recurrence of the problem The wipers have only one intermittent setting  It lasts for about five seconds between wipes and it is a feature seldom used unless the rain is coming down at just the right rate  An annoying engineering problem is the windshield wipers are different sizes  After sizing up just one of the wipers I went to the store and bought a package of wipers  they always come in two s  I had to go back to the store after realizing the second wiper was a different size  but at least the next time I need wipers I ll have a complete set Gas mileage has been excellent  averaging about 28 mpg  The gas tank is only 12 gallons  so expect about 300 miles between fill ups Two child seats fit in the back seat  but only the smallest of children could fit between the two child seats  essentially making this a four seater until the children get bigger Ride comfort is acceptable for short trips and bearable for long trips  Road noise is pervasive at high speeds and handling is fair  The interior is very spartan in appearance and the vinyl and plastic look cheap  Compared to other cars in its class   Saturn  Civic  Cavalier  Corolla  it s on par To conclude this is not the most comfortable car  heads will not turn when you drive it  it s had some problems  But  and this is a big but  it s never broken down  it holds lots of cargo  only cost  9 300 new  and has a current Kelley Blue Book trade in value of  2 400   what s not to love about this car What s gone wrong   related   cost 1 Plastic cap holder on windshield washer fluid broke  never fixed 2 Plastic driver seat belt holder broke  15 part  did work myself 3 Rubber insulator around rear passenger door  6 part  did work myself 4 Broken rear suspension spring  400   including labor br br
