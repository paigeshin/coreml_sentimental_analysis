 When I first saw this bright red 1999 Ford Ranger XLT Sport with  quot aerodynamic quot  striping  I thought it would be the perfect vehicle for my teenage daughter  I d bought her a 1999 Mazda B3000 Cab Plus 4 pickup three months earlier  and assumed this adorable truck would steal her heart and give ME the stodgier four door Mazda truck  She refused to give up the Mazda and I realized this was the perfect truck for a 40 something Mom who never had anything so cute  What s more  the 4 0 L engine allowed it to pull a horse trailer  with horse  I bought the truck used with 100 miles on it from a man who had won it at the local Ford dealership  It had never been titled or registered and was covered with the stickers of the local radio station which had sponsored the contest   Luckily  they came off easily  I must admit that the powerful  roaring 4 0 L engine has brought out the teenager in me and I sometimes just can t help leaving everyone behind when the traffic light turns green  When I drive more responsibly  I can get 20 MPG out of the truck  although 18 19 MPG is the norm  It was 15 MPG in the very beginning  but increased as the truck broke in  Unfortunately  this truck has Firestone Wilderness HT tires and I ve already made Firestone replace one for free when it was almost bald at 12 000 miles despite recommended rotations and balancing  They gave me a big talk about different qualities of rubber  but I know I ll be replacing all four tires within the year  After one year I ve had no problems whatsoever and have not even visited the dealer  I ve changed the oil myself and had the rotations balancing done at the local Tire Kingdom  I have another 20 000 miles warranty but hope I never meet the service department of the local Ford dealership  The interior is comfortable but not plush  The seats are a mixture of a tweed like material with a little velour thrown in  Very adequate  I wish I had an extended cab but I ve learned to simply take all the junk I ve accumulated out of the truck each weekend  I knew I never needed to keep that gallon of windshield washer fluid with me all the time  but now I KNOW I can t  This is the first time I can honestly say I love my vehicle br br
