 When we first had a baby  I was driving an Eclipse Spyder  Needless to say  this is not a baby car  As a matter of fact  I refuse to put my son in it  For a year  we managed to get by with one car that we could take our son around in  But  being an independent women  grin  I wanted to be able to leave the house when I was home alone with my son  which I couldn t do at this point  Why didn t I just keep the  baby  car  Well  mine was foreign  and my husband works at Ford you do the math  So  we needed a new car  I refused to be a minivan mom  no offense to those of you who are  I just don t like em  so we decided on an SUV  Being that my husband worked at Ford  he heard about the Escape long before it came out  And I wanted one  It was an Explorer  but smaller and cuter  That s a good combination considering I m small  and  well  cute   grin  But seriously  I liked the idea that it was an SUV that drove like a car  It was also supposed to be much safer  without the threat of rollovers that most SUV s are plagued with  So  we ordered one and after months of waiting  it came in  And it s beautiful  We got toreador red  which is a maroonish color  The interior is tan and black  The car is also available in yellow  yes  bright yellow  for you showoffs  red  a forest green  blue  black  white  and tan  I don t know the specific  Ford  names for all these colors  but that s what it breaks down to  Aside from the pleasing asthetic value of the Escape  it also drives great  If you are looking for a good off road vehicle  this is not the one you should be buying  But  the Escape wasn t made for offroaders  It was made for people who wanted the look of an SUV  with the control of a car  It s a little bumpier than a regular car  but the ride is smooth  It also corners very well  which I love  being used to a small convertible  The Escape is available in 2 Wheel Drive  or 4 Wheel Drive  We chose the 4WD variety  You can also get a four cylinder or six cylinder engine  Ours is six  According to the dealer  the four cylinder engines aren t selling as well  The Escape has some great standard features  Solar tint glass  Woo  How new millenium  power everything  roof rack  rear windshield wipers   flip and fold  rear seats  A C  anti lock brakes  and remote keyless entry  We also got side step bars  a power moonroof  and side airbags  Oh yea  did I mention that the CD player is standard  Nice  eh  All this  and a great price too  The base model runs around  18 000  Fully loaded  which ours is  is around  25 200  Not bad for an SUV  Gas mileage is a little better than standard SUV  City is 18 MPG and highway is 24 MPG  It s no car mileage  but still not bad  For all you mommies and daddies out there  the Escape also comes with three tether hookups for the backseats  This is a great feature to help keep your child s car seat secure  And our car seat fit very well  The backseats are relatively comfortable  and there is tons of legroom  Although it looks smaller than an Explorer  the didn t skimp on space  The rear area leaves plenty of room for numerous parcels or luggage  There is also a cover you can place over them to protect anything from flying french fries  Being a short person  I can t accurately judge the legroom in the driver s seat  but my husband  who is much taller than I am  had no problem fitting in the passenger seat  The car is very comfortable to drive  and I feel very safe with my child in the back  Ford has added a number of safety features to the Escape  making it a nice  reliable ride  It looks nice  drives well  and is priced affordably  For those parents out their looking for a good family vehicle  I highly recommend the Ford Escape  One warning  They are selling like hotcakes  so get one while you can  I believe there is quite a waiting list for orders  so if you are interested  call your dealer right away
