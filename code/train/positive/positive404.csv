 Why did I buy a 2000 GT Mustang well first I owned a 1969 Mach1 Mustang for the last 6 years and I can not tell you how much fun I had driving it This car made me a  quot king of the road quot People would stop traffic to let me out of parking lots parking spaces and even to exit driveways I think they just wanted to get a glimpse of American automotive history The Mustang is more than just a vehicle It is a symbol of who you are I love the way people would give me the thumbs up when they pulled up next to me or the stories they would share with me at car shows about their Mustangs that they owned or own They spoke about them as if they were a part of the family and that s how I felt about my old Mustang The most common phrase I hear is  quot I should never have gotten rid of my old Mustang quot  Well when it came time to purchase a new car I had plenty of choices but I knew I wouldn t be truly happy unless I was behind the wheel of my true love the Ford Mustang  As for driving one my test drive of the standard shift 2000 GT at the dealership was very pleasing The sound of the engine as I let the clutch out and drove out of first gear was so smooth and pleasing The power was on tap at all times Braking was excellent The all four disc brakes were a first time experience for me and I loved it The handling was quite nice Sharp turns were point and execute no questions asked I felt like the car was built around me in the drivers seat Everything was within reach Excellent view of the road front and rear  I can t wait for my new Mustang to arrive from the Dearborn Assembly plant I think I made the right choice Heck I know I made the right choice Mustangs are for anyone who wants fun performance and a little bit of American automotive history of their own As I tell all the Cheverolet lovers The STAMPEDE is louder than the HEARTBEAT br br
