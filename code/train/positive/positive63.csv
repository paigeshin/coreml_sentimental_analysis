 I recently purchased my 92 thunderbird from a women who took good car of the car and was the only other owner  She has papers on everything that she has had done on the car  But  now it seems like I have been getting all of the headaches of the car  I have only had the car for 4 months and I have had to replace the alternator  belts  tires  and some gas filter thing  can t remember the name  I know that these are the standard things to go in the car  but the parts are VERY expensive  We have to other brands of Ford cars and their parts aren t nearly this expensive  This is my  1 warning the parts are expensive  Also my insurance tripled with this car and I have never even had an accident or speeding ticket  There are also many unidentifiable noises in the car  Popping noises from the brakes and somewhere in the back  There is also water leaking in when it rains  Of course the mechanics can t find out what is wrong  Overall the car is ok but not really worth all of the hassle and money I just recently got into a car accident with this car in April of 2001 and ended up totaling the car  I was hit on the drivers side by a dodge ram that was going 60 miles an hour  Luckily I walked away from the car with only a bruise from the seatbelt  I was very lucky  However the car had to be destroyed  The car held up very well in the accident and I was very surprised that I didn t get hurt  This car is very safe to drive around in and you won t have to worry about getting hurt if you do get in an accident
