 I was in the market for a small truck  I looked around and I found that the ranger offered the most for your money  although I later found that the resale on these trucks drop very quikly  For less then I could have bought a toyota standard cab with a 4 cylinder  I got a super cab ranger with a 4 0 V6  with a 5 speed trans and power mirrors  I have put 62 000 miles on it with no problems what so ever  the gas milage isn t the greatest  but it s worth it  the 4 0 has more than enough power  and tows my 19  ski boat with little effort  I was really impressed when I hooked up my boat to see how it tows  I drove it from L A to NewYork to Maine and back to L A with no trouble what so ever  I recently installed a vortech super charger with 5 pounds of boost and the truck just screams  very very reliable  If anyone has any advice  any problems with 4 0  or questions  please e mail me at cornfed621 aol net  I will gladly answer any questions reguarding the 4 0 ranger  any advice would be greatly appreciated
