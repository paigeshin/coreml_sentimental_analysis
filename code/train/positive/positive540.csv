 If you needed a commuter vehicle  what would you want most  When I bought my 1991 Ford Festiva new  I went out with a list that looked like this  I want it to be small so I can park anywhere  I want it to run on fumes  cheap to insure  not a lot of bells and whistles to break and encourage theft  and to be ugly enough to discourage the thieves and junkie denizens of my commute destination  It d be a cold day in Hell if I ever found this car up on blocks missing those tiny 12 quot  wheels  I put Sears or Grand Auto  99 00 for four tires on it every couple of years  It has no radio  five of my radios in other cars were stolen in SF with lots of damage to the car  I also wanted a well built  reliable car  so when I learned that the Festiva was built in Korea using Mazda parts  I knew I had found what I wanted The car is now over 8 years old  has over 100K miles  looks like a habitue of the Bowery  but still will travel at sustained speeds of 80 mph  if needed  It continues to get 40  miles to the gallon  My ownership expenses are minimal  one battery  self done oil changes every 2 5K miles  the front disc brake pads replaced once  and it s on its third set of 12 quot  tires  Insurance for it runs about  400 yr  and no one has ever tried to steal it  This  91 horribly ugly Surf Green Festiva is  quite simply  the least troublesome  inexpensive car I ve ever owned  Too bad Ford stopped selling them after the  93 model year I have tried finding body parts for this car in junkyards it got sideswiped while parked  and has lots of ugly bondo  but most in my area don t even have a single Festiva  so people must be keeping them  If you can get one that has been taken care of  don t have too much concern for how pretty and impressive your commute car is  you ll have some trouble finding anything better suited for commuting that will serve you as well as this ugly duckling  No  mine is not for sale  I m going to run it till one of us dies
