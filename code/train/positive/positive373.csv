 I purchased an Expedition in April  97  quite by accident  The Explorer that I had ordered was destroyed in the St Louis floods  Anyway  about the vehicle  A 1  The Expedition was a joy to drive  luxurious and car like  wonderful on a long trip  Four wheel drive made towing a large boat out of the water a breeze  even tore some trees out of the ground for a neighbour  no problem  The only problem I encountered in two years was a faulty solenoid on the four wheel drive motor  Got it stuck in 4wd low  For anyone that this happens to  its an easy makeshift fix  The solenoid is readily accessible on the side of the drive motor  It is vacuum operated so if the solenoid goes  just disconnect the vacuum lines and switch them around  This will get you to a dealer without being restricted to 20mph Gas mileage is not for the faint of heart or those relying on economy  9 miles per gallon in the city  13 16 mpg on the highway Shear size alone guarantees when two cars are going for the same parking spot  you win everytime Braking was excellent for such a heavy vehicle  6200lbs I miss my Expedition br br
