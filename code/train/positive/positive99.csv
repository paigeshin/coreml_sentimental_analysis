 To all of those who dislike their SUV s  think again  This is finally a truck that lives up to the term SUV  After owning many cars  and not having any luck  I finally found a vehicle that is dependable  This is my second Explorer  and I love it  I purchased this one 4 months ago  and have only minor complaints  The only problems that I have had were paint related  and that was the dealers fault  Seems they scratched it when prepping the car for delivery  I feel that the value of this vehicle is better than average  The reliability is better than I have seen with other SUV s  I traded in my Pontiac Grand Prix Early and am completely satisfied  I have been reading a lot of other people s reviews  and am a bit confused  I am reading about how uncomfortable  or how bumby  or how much this car uses gas  well just a few questions  This is a truck right  It is not supposed to be a car  correct  Knowing this why did you buy it if you are going to complain  There are a few things you should know about this truck before buying it  It is bumpier than a car  it does not get 25 30 miles to the gallon  and it will not do 0 60 in under 8 seconds  but then again  get the right setup and you can pull just about anything  drive through or over pretty much all that gets in your way  and feel confident that you have lots of vehicle around you  The only major complaint I have is that it does rattle a little  However I knew that going in to it  That is what a truck does  As I see it  you pay for the power  and ability  All I can say for the skeptics is  if you are looking for a well built  reasonably priced truck  this is it  If you want comfort  room  and gas mileage  buy a bigger truck  or get a luxury car  cause this aint it
