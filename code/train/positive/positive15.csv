 Just last year  GM had an untouched SUV class  that of the Suburban  A class that sold about 150 000 vehicles  one that Ford just couldn t let go unchallenged  The answer  The new Ford Excursion  This hulking SUV is now the biggest in its class  How big  Well  about 4 tons  Its about 3 3 inches wider than the Suburban  and about 7 2 inches longer  Its set on a f250 frame  and from the side looks like a van  but the front end is that of the superduty  It accelerates 0 60 in about 10 6 seconds  which is quick for a 4 ton vehicle  It comes with the Triton V10  the 5 4 V8 or the optional 7 2 liter Powerstroke  Up front it boasts two plush captain s chairs with a center console  The dash and instrument cluster is that of the f250  Further back  there are two rows of seats  which can fold down or be removed to give the Excursion 16 Cubic feet of cargo space over the Suburban  It is 5 4  5 8 inches taller than the Suburban  featuring one of the flattest cargo racks available  The rear hatch opens three ways  to cut down on those huge rear doors  The spare rests inside  neatly packed away against the driver side of the vehicle  After testdriving  I found that the ride was smooth  but firm  The 4X4 suspension is different than that of the 4X2  but being as long as it is  high centering is a problem  Even though this is a fully capable 4X4  off road use is limited again to its size  Added guards under the front bumper keeps cars from sliding under the vehicle in the case of a head on accident  Even weighing 4 tons doesn t keep the Excursion from towing around 10 000 pounds  The V10 sports 310 hp  425lb ft  while the diesel comes with around 500 lb ft of torque  or a 5 4 Triton V8 rated at 255 hp  Safety is great  due to its size  What could hurt the thing besides a bus  It has a massive 44 gallon fuel tank  which takes upward of 60 dollars to fill  But it has a surprising 700  mile range on one fill up  The cool overhead console displays  besides other things  about how many miles you have left in your tank  Price is a big factor  About 34K for the XLT model  40 800 for the limited  Which  for the dollar  isn t a big increase from that of the explorer  or a nice f2 or 350  Roll over is that of any big SUV  Ford has taken great pains to limit roll over as much as possible without sacrificing too much clearance  My personal interaction with this truck is of testdriving br br
