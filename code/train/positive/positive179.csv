 I bought my second F250 Super Duty Crew Cab in August of 1999  and WOW  what a great vehicle  The 300 HP V 10 engine pulls like a well trained team of mules  the Lariat interior package ensures ultimate style and comfort  the crew cab configuration yields room for six  the 4x4 is almost unstickable  The 10 in V10 is about what you can expect for gas mileage in a 4x4 configuration  The ride is a little stiff off pavement  but very comfortable on the highway  The carrying capacity is more than adequate  as I have hauled in excess of 2500 pounds of feed with no problems  I have pulled a 7500 lb farm tractor  and it was barely noticeable I bought this vehicle because I needed a pickup truck that had room for my family of four with plenty of cargo capacity  We have 7 ranches in Texas  so I use this truck extensively off road  I love everything but the gas mileage and limited fuel capacity  The 29 gallon tank on the short bed model needs to be refilled far too frequently If you are looking for a vehicle that will turn a few heads  carry more than groceries and kids  go off road with style and comfort  and you don t mind poor mileage  this is your truck  Get the Lariat interior  the extra comforts are worth the price br br
