 The F 150 that I have has been the best truck that I have owned  the comfort level of the seats and the interior is great  It came with the standard installed sound system  that has been superior  The rear opening doors have been a plus  easy in and out and with good latches and seals  The model I have has a 300 cubic inch 6  that has plenty of power  to handle the 4X4 operations  the automatic locking hubs leave a little to be desired  other then that the truck handles and operates with ease  The hub locking  is not what I expected  the thing I don t like is you must travel forward about 10 feet before they lock in  so if you don t lock them in before you start  you could be in trouble  and if you have to back up for any reason  they will unlock  and the whole thing starts over again  Not one of Ford s better Ideas  The manual locking hubs are still the way to go  I bought this truck because Fords are the only trucks I have ever owned  this one makes number 10 br br
