 The Ford Excursion Limited 2002 An Oversize Status Statement  Looking at the Ford Excursion 2002 there is no doubt that it is a formidable machine  This oversize SUV is really beautiful whether you look at its exterior or its interior  Two words can describe the interior of the Ford Excursion Limited  ROOMY and LUXURY  Sitting behind the steering wheel of the Excursion you have the impression that you could park a second car inside  The Limited Edition comes equipped with leather seats  a 6 way captain style seat for the driver  and rich looking wood grain trims on the interior door panels and also on the front console  These features really give the Excursion s interior a fantastic appearance  As for the front cabin the rear of the excursion will again offers lots of room  The second row of seats can either be completely folded or folded in a 60 40 manner  The third row seats can also be folded and you will also have the option to remove it from the truck if you need to transport cargo  For the driver with the exception of the glove compartment  which is to far on the passenger  side  all other gauges and controls are easy to see and reach  The sound system  an AM FM  cassette  single CD stereo is superb and it is only surpassed by the quality of the sound it emits  The exterior body of the Excursion Limited is as attractive as the interior  The color of the Excursion I test drove was Deep Blue with beige body side moldings and this made for a super color combination with the tan leather interior  I really liked the tri panel rear door  it sure makes it easy to load cargo and equipment in the Excursion  The top part will open upward as for most other SUV but the lower portion of the rear will split open in the middle  The Excursion also comes equipped with a class IV load equalizing trailer hitch that will allow to safely pull a load of up to 11 000 pounds  Driving the Excursion on the highway is a great experience  but aside from driving it on the open road I do not believe it makes for great driving within city limit and for off roading  It is a very comfortable truck to drive and it is dead quiet  to me it is like a Lincoln on a truck frame  A friend of mine who owns a marina uses his Excursion to pull boats around  he told me that his old Suburban would do a much better job at pulling a loaded trailer than his new Excursion  The 2002 Excursion Limited I drove was equipped with a V 10 powerful engine  The transmission is a 4 speed automatic transmission  with a shift on the fly 4X4 system  The towing capacity is 11 000 pounds and the cargo space  with all seats folded and third row removed is 146 cubic feet  As you probably noticed after reading this review is that I really do have mixed feeling about the 2002 Ford Excursion Limited  It is a very beautiful truck  actually I think that it is too nice to be used as a working vehicle  But then it is also much too big to be used for city commuting  I guess this leave that it is an expensive SUV  TOY  for those who have it all
