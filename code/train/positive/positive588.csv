 I bought my Explorer for basically one main reason  More Space  I had previously owned a 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP 2 door and its small back seat was cramping for my large dog  Max   He now has plenty of windows to look out and tons of room to move around as he desires  It s also nice being able to go to Sam s Club and fit everything I  my mother    my sister purchase into one car  This SUV has outweighed my expectations  It heats up quickly in freezing weather  has minimal maintenance problems  and smooth ride  This vehicle fits into my life well I am very much amazed at the reliability of my Explorer  I bought my 1996 Ford Explorer used in September  2001 with 120 000 miles on it  and two days ago it hit 130 000  I was amazed to have gone 10 000 miles without a single problem except for nails in my tire  Those 10 000 miles weren t easy either  mostly driving through downtown Chicago s bumpy streets on my way to college  This vehicle also has plenty of room for all necessary activities  Shopping  Clothes   Groceries  nights out in downtown Chicago  carting around my 80 Lb Chocolate Laborador  helping friends move  driving to school  camping  etc  etc  This vehicle s looks are stylish and rugged at the same time and perfect for any occasion  My ONLY complaint with this vehicle is its horrible gas consumption  I drive approximately 200 miles a week  City   Suburb  and have to fill the 17 Gallon tank up each week  All of the Ford Explorer s amenities outweigh this one drawback  and make me feel completely satisfied with this purchase
