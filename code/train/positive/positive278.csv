 The Ford Contour is a nice  roomy  little sports car that won t sack you in the wallet  It s got the option of a sporty engine  still small liters for good gas mileage  a 2 5 liter V 6 under the hood that packs a little kick behind the pedal  It has a lot of room in the back for all of the passengers or any other cargo that you had to carry  The trunk is really big so you can fit whatever you need it to  The steering is tight and responsive  and the car is solid  I drive cars hard and have yet to have a problem with this one  The stereo is what really shocked me though  For a Ford stock radio and speakers  it really sounds nice  I have the stock tape deck  I don t think that they offer any other options for the radio  but I could be wrong  All in all  the contour is a nice car for a little money if you re in the market for a small compact car  It has good gas mileage  which is necessary for these recent gas price increases and it handles beautifully  The suspension and other parts of the car should last you for a long time  It is a good buy if you want a small car br br
