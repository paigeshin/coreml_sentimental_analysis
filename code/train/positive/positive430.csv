 If you ask most people about a Ford Taurus  their either going to tell you that they loved it or hated it  You re going to get a mixed response from me  If you are looking for a short term or lease vehicle  then this car is for you  If you are looking for a good  reliable long term car  4 years or more  then this is not the car for you  My in laws bought this car brand new at the end of a model year   They bought it having only 50 miles on it in January 1995  My husband acquired the car from his parents in January 1997  We had the car until we traded it in December 1999  Overall  it was a good car  There were some major repairs that had to be done   For example  a new head gasket costing around 2K  However  on most of the major repairs Ford did eventually recall the vehicle for that particular item  By recall  I mean that they refunded your money if you had already done the repair or repaired it for free if you hadn t  I d say that Ford recalled this car for about 6 different problems  The good point  is that they DID recall it when they found a consistent problem The problem for us came in December 1999 when the car had 93K miles  All at once  everything went wrong with the car  It needed a new air conditioner  new motor mounts  and new heat core among other things  The total for the repairs came to over  3 000  Needless to say  we were not going to put this kind of work into an old car  That s when we decided to trade it in  My in laws  amp  my family still buy the Ford Taurus  They have found the same thing that we have time  amp  again  The car is great for the 1st 3 4 years  Until we had these problems  the car was a very good  reliable car  The seats are very comfortable even on long road trips  We should know  we took many  many trips in that car  We will buy a Ford still   We have one now  We have learned from experience  though  When we re looking for a nice sized but affordable short term car  we will get a Taurus  If we re looking for a long term car that will be with us 10 years from now  we ll shop in another direction
