 I bought my F150 just over a year ago and I have had plenty of time to formulate an opinion     I decided to buy a full size pickup since I was in the military and figured I would be moving a lot  I had been looking at the Ford F 150 and the Dodge 1500  both in the same price feature zone  Here is what I discovered The Ford has features that make it better suited for the individual who will be travelling mainly highway or town miles for several reasons  First off  the fact that it has the best gas mileage of any truck in its class helps  and I have the Big V8 too  When you fill up a 24 gallon tank  that extra 2 miles per gallon helps believe it or not  Secondly  the acceleration on the Ford was outstanding  it was not sluggish at all which helps for changing lanes in heavy traffic  The anti lock breaks also offer better braking response than the Dodge  I have no complaints with payload either  I have an ATV that I drive right up into the bed  close the tailgate  and go on my way  With my weight and the ATV that is a total of about 800  pounds on the tailgate  and it takes it just fine without a single stress mark  Don t really even notice a difference in acceleration with the extra weight   Be careful on the turns though or you might lose your load  If you want to add a topper  the Ford has a locking tailgate so you can secure the bed without having to buy extra equipment Price will vary from dealer to dealer as you all know  but overall  the Ford dealers were more willing to drop their price to stay competitive than the Dodge dealers I dealt with  Using the site http www edmunds com I found the dealer invoice price so I knew how far they could really go  Surprisingly  the Ford dealer I bought from went  100 below their invoice to sell me a truck  Now grant it  it was near the end of the year clearance time  but they still beat the dodge by over  2500 There are some drawbacks though If you like loud music  like me  the stock stereo speakers deck are less than desirable  No problem right  Get some new speakers  Problem is  without some severe custom work  you can t even buy different speakers  That can be very costly if you don t know how to do it yourself Another sore point is the back seat  The Ford only has a 3 door extended cab  Dodge has 4 doors  and the back seat has about 4 inches less leg room than the Dodge  Because of the way the back seat folds down in the Ford  it makes installing subs or additional speakers almost impossible The Ford also does not offer any kind of convenience console like digital compass and temperature gauge  the Dodge does  No big deal  but here FYI Another piece of advice  that I wish I had adhered to  If you live in a climate that MIGHT get snow     SPEND THE EXTRA CASH ON 4 WHEEL DRIVE  I already regret not having it  Rear wheel drive only  even with weight in the bed  is darn near impossible to get up a snowy icy hill  I saw 10 or so pickups in the ditch this past winter  with little 4 cylinder front wheel drive cars passing them like nothing If you are an Urban Cowboy  the Ford is a great choice  If you want to do a lot of farm work or off roading  I would have to go with the Dodge or a larger ford  F 250 or F 350  The Ford handles more like a big car  and when you are behind the wheel of a Dodge  you know you are driving a truck br br
