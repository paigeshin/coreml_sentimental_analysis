 I replaced my totaled Ramcharger with a 1995 Bronco XLT  I looked around carefully   read my review entitled  quot Before you talk turkey  inspect the bird quot    I found what has been a gem The truck had high mileage for a 2 year old machine  but that did not seem a problem  A check on the previous owner  and contact with him  confirmed that the truck had been used for a 60 mile commute  all highway driving This Bronco has all the amenities you think you are driving around in a four wheel drive Lincoln  All the power accessories bothered me  they tend to break  So far  after 2 1 2 years  none have  I ve put over 100 000 miles on the vehicle since buying it it has the overdrive automatic transmission  so at 65 miles per hour  the engine is running at under 2000 RPM and can get up to 19 5 MPG if I leave the cruise control on  32x1150 tires  The overall average is about 16 5   I do a lot of highway driving I noted in another review by a mechanic comments about the cost of repairs in the areas of ball joints and exhaust systems  He s right   if you need exhaust headers replaced in a late model Bronco  it s a major job  You can get ball joints with lube points  so if you replace the original set with these  then keep them lubed  they will last a long time  By the way when you have ball joints done  have the front axle u joints replaced while the whole thing is apart The other aspect of front suspension component wear are the twin I beam control arms  The key things that get loose are the large control arm bushings that stabilize the rear of the arms  These arms in turn stabilize the twin I beam front axle system  The right side is the most likely to have problems   it s close to exhaust system components  and there are heat shielding bushing collars that protect the rubber part of the bushings  Over time  the right side rubber bushing can get mushy from heat exposure  Just keep an eye on it Another thing to think about   this applies to Broncos with serpentine belts  and any other vehicle so equipped    periodically check the belt  and remove it to make sure that the things it turns are without bearing or bushing noise and shaft play  Make sure the idler and tension pulley bushings are good  If something freezes up  you are SOL  Carry a spare serpentine belt if you travel in remote areas The key to owning a Bronco  and really  any other vehicle  is in the maintenance program  Since in some areas  there s more to an SUV than a regular vehicle  there are added maintenance points that need to be attended to One of the things that you must do is to periodically lock the hubs and drive a while  If your Bronco is equipped with the auto locking hubs  you cannot do this unless in four wheel drive  so you have to be off road  The auto locking hubs are a nice convenience   but one of the first things I did was to replace them with Warn manual locking hubs  The auto locking hubs can result in too little exercise for the front axle u joints  Once these joints start getting twitchy from lack of exercise  they can cause the auto hubs to lock falsely  The off road performance of the Bronco is good  It has gone everywhere I wanted to go with no complaints or difficulties  By the way   if you are one of those who likes  quot mudding quot    remember that that mud gets into things and can reduce longevity unless properly cleaned out This is another truck that the manufacturer has discontinued in favor of fancier  more expensive rigs aimed at the yuppie market  It s a shame   it s a good truck  1996 was the last model year if you are looking for a strong machine that still has some  not all  of the simplicity of the basic pickup truck  the Bronco can serve you well br br
