 Since our family has multiplied from 2 to 3  we knew it was time to drive a car that could carry all of our stuff  So out we went test driving everything under the sun until we came across a bright red Ford Windstar 2001 minivan  I do mean Bright RED  At first I was not crazy about the color  but since we live in a town with a bunch of crazy drivers  at least they can t miss us pulling out It was a cold yucky day  So when we popped into this vehicle the sales guy gave us the key and started the engine  While we were sitting in the parking lot the van quickly got warm This was a good sign  The front and the back are on two different temperature controls  The front passengers can decide the temperature for the whole crew or give the control to whoever is sitting in the back The seats are incredible  After owning a Jetta VW and Mazda 626 for what seems like forever  we love these seats  We can t wait for our next big trip from South Carolina to Ohio or Florida  My friend just bought a Ford Explorer and after her last long trip she is ready to trade it in and get a Windstar  She loves to ride in it  and so do all of the neighborhood kids I still can t get over how roomy this minivan is  When you are in the vehicle you feel like you can stretch out and really enjoy the ride  If you need to  you or your passenger can pop into the back without getting out of the vehicle  Of course after the vehicle has come to a full and complete stop  This helps on big trips  But if and when you need to get out the interior lights can be switched to the sleeping baby mode so that only the floor lights will light up As far as removing seats  My husband does that  He says that they are heavy and we are not quite sure where we would store them if we have to remove them while we were away from home  That is why the Mazda MVP is better in that department  Their back seat folds into the bottom of the floor board  That is a nice feature that I hope becomes a standard next on all minivans  Two doors  Need I say more  I am not quite sure how  without getting into the minivan  I would buckle in 2 children with only 1 door If you are ready to plunge into the family minivan make sure you get a minivan with at least these options 1  Power windows for the front and the back  So on hot days you can open the back windows to let the hot air escape and close to keep in the air conditioning 2  Dark tinted windows to keep some of hot sun out and children s goofy offending faces in 3  Two control panels for the temperature controls  One for the front and one for the back  You the driver will always have the main control 4  Try to get a light as possible colored car if you live like us in the south  The darker the car the faster it will heat up in the hot  hot sun 5  Test drive as many cars as you can stand  Take your time and remember to have your vehicle checked by a good mechanic  There are a lot of lemons out there and you have to be careful with whatever car you purchase
