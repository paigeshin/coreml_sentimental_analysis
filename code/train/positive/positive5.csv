 I have always preferred Ford products  When buying a car I expect to keep it for awhile  Every Ford I have owned has given me years of satisfaction  That is until I bought a Taurus  One year after buying my car the trouble began  My wife was driving when she noticed the  quot Service Engine Soon quot  light came on  She drove the car to the dealer and the Service Manager said we needed a new transmission  Fortunately our warranty had not expired  As far as everything else  I am quite satisfied  It drives smoothly and the engine seems to have a lot of power  I have also been satisfied with the gas mileage  Before buying a Taurus it would be best to talk to the Dealer about this  Ask about its history of transmission problems and what Ford is doing to correct this problem br br
