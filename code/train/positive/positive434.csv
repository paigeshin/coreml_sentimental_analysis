 I always thought of a vehicle in utilitarian terms  A car is a car  if it got me from point A to point B safely and without incident  it did it s job  My Chevy conversion van did this without any trouble for the 8 years I owned it  So why is it that this vehicle has changed my mind  I chose this vehicle mainly because it was different from the other cars on the road  At first glance  I thought it was weird looking  Then I looked again and thought  I can see me in one of those  SUV s are so overdone now  I don t want a truck   they ride like a truck  I can t go back to a car  they are so short  A station wagon  no way  And I was just so tired of the big van Yes the SportTrac fits the bill perfectly  Not a  mom  car at all  Enough room for all 5 if need be   but with a 17  15 and 11 year old  not a common occurance these days  The interior is comfy  the ride is smooth and quiet  With the tonneau cover it is just like a car  trunk  yet I can fold out the cage and use it for hauling  tho  nothing  dirty  those things are for my husbands truck  With the cage in regular position  I have a place to put my groceries  and they don t slide around in the bed   I was EVER so tired of groceries falling out the door of my van  and mini van before that The v 6 engine has the  pulling out  power that I need   Like a shot  I find it extremely easy  and fun to drive  and imagine my surprise at turning up a snowy hill  beginning a fishtail  turning that little switch  and sailing up the hill around the other vehicles   I ve never before appreciated the value of 4 wheel drive  this is my first  In the past I washed my van perhaps once a year  this one I wash once a week  sometimes more often  Can you see where I m going with this The leather interior warms up quick  the heat is top notch  The dealer replaced the Firestone tires for free  I think because they screwed up my order and I had to wait 5 months for my SportTrac  I got it in December  2000  It has gone through a snowy and messy northeast winter with no complaints so far  I am no longer nervous about driving in the snow  tho  I still don t trust other drivers  I don t hear the whistle that I have heard others complain about I find that I park in places that maximize the visibility of my SportTrac   is that so wrong  It certainly turns heads  I let my husband take it to work once so he could show it off to his co workers  they were all very impressed  or so I m told  I enjoy picking up my daughter at school  but I am careful to look non chalant about driving this cool vehicle  Perhaps in a year or two  I ll let my son borrow it  he keeps bugging me to let him  There is a drawback tho  I have to call it a vehicle  it s not a truck you know  Also  I got the best color  the island blue  which is really teal  You must have mud flaps in the snow  or you get snow sludge on the rails  They are not included  or an option when I got mine  I got all the options except the moon roof   it makes the interior roof lower  and I am tall  and the 6 CD player  I have CD s at home  but I enjoy the radio  and I have 12 programmed stations to choose from  There is a single CD player and cassette player in it   Do people still use cassettes While I realize that this is a new vehicle and it should be just as I wanted   after all I chose it  I have never had such an interest in a car  um  I mean vehicle  I hope that my joy in this vehicle is long lived  and only time will tell  but for now as you can see  I cannot say enough about my SportTrac  And while I highly recommend it  don t buy one  or mine won t be so unique any more
