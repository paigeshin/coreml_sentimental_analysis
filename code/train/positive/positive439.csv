 This is my first  non car  vehicle I ve ever owned and I absolutely love it  It was difficult to pay as much for it as I did  but I am very happy with the purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat  It has just over 8000 miles and has never had any problems  The ride is smooth and quiet  I LOVE the lumbar support  My friends  whom drive trucks  are amazed at the ride comfort The bed may seem short  but it has never let me down  I ve moved my kitchen table  chairs  furniture  and 2 Queen mattresses in the bed  not at the same time  Using the Bed Extender and the handy tie down handles located at the top of the bed  it can carry a lot 4X4 handles great too  It s gotten me through heavy snows and I actually got to use it off road once  in the mud  with no problems  For more info  visit http www teamsporttrac com
