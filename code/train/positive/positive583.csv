 Puschased used with 60 000 miles  This is an XLT model and is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned  In the 1st 6 months  I have driven about 10 000 miles and have had no problems  I have had to replace 2 tail light bulbs and the battery  Regular service has included power stearing fluid change  Transmission fluid change  radiator cleaned and flushed and 2 wiper blades in addition to regular oil changes with Mobil 1 5W30 motor oil  Excellent The remote outside mirrors leave no blind spots when properly adjusted  Handling is excellent  stearing is responsive and predictable  It is one of the smoothest riding vehicles I have ever owned  Twice in this time I have moved 400 and 900 miles and found the cargo capacity excellent  Even fully loaded  the handling is smooth  I like the option of opening the rear glass or the whole tailgate  The seats are cloth and very comfortable  This vehicle has power seats with lumbar and calf support which allows very comfortable adjustments  In my opinion this is an excellent choice for anyone who needs the ability to haul children and or stuff  Front Rear seating is ample and comfortable  Head and leg room superior to most I have driven  Gas mileage is good  Wind noise above 60 mph moderate Would recommend this SUV highly  Since it has dual air bags  small children should only ride in the back seat  Auto 4 Wheel drive excellent for rail snow ice br br
