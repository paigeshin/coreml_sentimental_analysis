 I am not generally a fan of small cars  especially the four door econobox variety  I am a fairly good sized person and like my space when I drive  My wife is a fan of small cars but shares my opinion about the  quot cookie cutter quot  sameness of the majority of sub compact offerings available today  The one thing we do agree on is  quot four cylinders 5 speeds quot  No slushboxes allowed in our vehicles  We both expect a vehicle to perform and have a reasonable level of over  the road comfort  On a whim  we recently stopped at a Ford dealer who had a number of Focus cars on the lot  I had looked at the four door model before and was not impressed enough to drive one since they had all contained automatic transmissions  What caught my eye this time was the one vehicle that had two doors  a manual transmission and a very non conforming appearence  We took a drive in the ZX3 and it was love at first sight  The car has what I consider to be a very European appearence  no glitz  everything is where it is for a reason  The vehicle accelerates and handles far out of expectation to it s sticker price  Finally  the seat was more confortable than the standard size car we had just test  driven at another dealer  I did not feel confined and my wife did not have the big car blues  Bottom line is that the Focus ZX3 is the pick of the litter in the low cost  small car class  we bought it
