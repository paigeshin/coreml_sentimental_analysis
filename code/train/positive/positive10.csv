 A year ago we bought a 1997 Windstar  I have not regret the choice since  I have never had a minivan before and we started off looking at Caravans  Grand Caravans and Voyagers  I found that the Caravan  amp  Voyager had too little room between the back and middle seats  And the Grand Caravan was to large for my small frame  Then I can upon the Windstar  Not only does it have the room I require  It also came with two Captain chair in the middle not all Windstars have them  but I recommend them  This left plenty of room for my 3 children and even my two large dogs I highly recommend this van  It is as spacious as you need and on top of that  it is one of the safest minivans on the market  It was point out to me that there is actually two latches to secure the back door  while most minivans have the single latch on the floor  This makes it less likely the back will open up in an accident  So all in all  this is the best van for your money br br
