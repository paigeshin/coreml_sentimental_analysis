 We just bought a ford explorer and got rid of our old escort and then kept our camry had 115000 miles on it while the escort had only 60000 what a mistake that was  the camry pooped out on us Now don t get me wrong the camry was a great little car well mid sized car but it had a lot of miles and needed a new trans  and the engine was soon to come We decided instead of getting all that replaced we would just get a new car We decided on another escort We needed something to balance everything out so to speak We have a big gas guzzling roomy dependible explorer  now we needed a not so roomy  fuel efficient just as dependible car we had had great luck with the old escort and we decided once again to get one This one would be a sedan lx with a standard trans It proved to be a great little car  the explorer is our vacation daily driver  the escort is our around town daily driver  The biggest problem is that it is a little underpowered  no pick up at all Another one is the seats are not very comfy and it is cramped front and back We have had no troubles at all with this car If you are looking for a fuel efficient VERY dependible car the ford escort is for you br br
