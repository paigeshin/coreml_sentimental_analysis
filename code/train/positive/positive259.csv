 We bought our first Explorer in 1996  I have to admit I was reluctant about driving a  quot truck quot  but was soon won over  It was almost as luxurious as any car I d owned and  boy  could I see better on the road  I really enjoyed it and it was very reliable After a couple of years we traded it for a 1998 Eddie Bauer version  Even more bells and whistles and again very reliable  At this point I knew I would never go back to a  quot car quot  again Recently  we bought the 2000 Limited edition  I absolutely love it  It has power everything  Probably more buttons than I ll ever be able to figure out  but I will have fun trying My favorite new feature are the memory seats  My husband is tall and I was constantly having to re adjust the seat when he would drive my previous Explorers  Now  we with just a click of the remote opener the seat is perfectly adjusted for me when I get in It has a very smooth ride and handles well  It also has beautiful  very comfortable leather seats  The sound system is great and has the optional 6 CD player  That is perfect for long trips The Explorer is just the right size for me and my husband and is comfortable for our occasional back seat passengers  It also holds lots of suitcases  golf clubs and or dive gear  when needed  It really is the best of both worlds   the comfort of a luxury car  the cargo capabilities of a truck  There s plenty of room in the back to haul groceries or even sustain a massive shopping spree   Trust me b Update added January 7 2001 b Having driven this Explorer for almost 8 000 miles and several months I am happy to report  knock on wood  that I have had absolutely no problems with it  I very much love this vehicle   My husband won t let me call it a car  I refuse to call it a truck  and SUV is so   well  you know This Limited Explorer rides very comfortably on the road and it is great for driving around town  It is averaging about 19 miles to a gallon of gas  I get rave reviews whenever anyone rides with me to lunch  as well  That s always a nice plus We ve hauled a lot of stuff in it  especially right before Christmas   We have grandkids  The rear seats fold down for carrying larger items such playhouses  and bicycles in the box I can also tell you we have hauled a new computer with 19 quot  monitor  big boxes and 8 foot step ladder at the same time  It was a bit interesting on the drive home  but we got it all in there  One friend laughs that my husband and I have single handedly kept the economy going by our weekend shopping sprees b Bonus  Bun Warmers b I ve also discovered during the unusually cold weather we ve had in Memphis  that the seat warmer is an absolutely wonderful option  Both the driver and passenger seat comes equipped with this option  It s easy to use  just depress the button on the side of the seat and in a few minutes the leather seats are comfortably warm  We ve had snow and ice a couple of times recently  very unusual for Memphis  and these seats have kept me toasty warm b Convenient Rear Controls  The rear heat and air controls have been very convenient for transporting passengers  It allows them to control the blower and keeps them comfortable  You can even let them hookup headphones in the rear  This would be great if I was hauling older kids in the back b Some of my favorite options b  Memory seats  only available on the Limited  This has been such a convenience  No more arguments with my husband  you moved my seat  Power seats  driver and passenger  You can move seats forward  backward  up  down  there s also the ability to tilt slightly forward or backward   The memory feature remembers how you like all these options  Power windows  standard on Limited and Eddie Bauer versions  Windows can be locked and unlocked by the driver  Dual controls on steering wheels   it s really nice to be able to adjust the temperature and fan  as well as control the volume of the radio or cd without moving your hands from the steering wheel  Power moon roof is nice on warm  sunny days  The console display gives me several options to view my gas consumption  gallons used  miles per gallon  and gas remaining  It also performs various system checks at my request  The CD player has great sound  There is a 5 disc changer in the console  as well as the ability to play a single disc in the slot in the dashboard  The speakers seem to be everywhere and you can easily adjust their performance to your taste  Remote Lock Security alarm  Two clicks on the remote lock assures me that all doors are shut and locked and the alarm is activated  There have been a couple of times a door didn t shut well and I was alerted to by using this feature I love this car and think it would probably be a great buy when it starts showing up in the used car market   if you ever find one  The owners may just hold onto this baby for a while  It s the perfect luxury car that just thinks it s a truck As a happy  3 time Explorer owner I highly the Explorer Limited 2000 br br
