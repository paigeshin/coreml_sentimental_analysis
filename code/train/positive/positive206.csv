 The key to a  good  Ford Explorer  is to  explore  the history first  Know what you re buying  people  I currently have 52000 and change on mine  Check with Carfax regarding the car s history  If the dealer will not  go elsewhere  Ford is known for quality  so they claim  so this should not be an enormous undertaking for them to do so  Ford s ultimate motive is to sell  sell  sell  Like everyone else  Customer service should not lag behind  Unfortunately  it has for me  If the CS was even adequate I would have gladly put up with the little problems I have endured  My rear windshield wiper has a mind of it s own  So does my fuel gauge  It has become mandatory for me to reset my trip odometer and fill up every 222 miles  Easy enough to remember  Ford said they will be happy to do an  exploratory  check on the problem  There word really 100 to tell me it s a  3 problem  I know  it s like that everywhere  All the same it s still irritating  as the mechanic said this with a snicker  And no not the candy bar  For me  the problem is not the vehicle  it s the people selling and fixing the vehicle  Fortunately  the selling is over on day one  It s wise to make friendly with your local mechanic down the road  Trust me  The vehicle I own is of the  Sport  breed  It fits me perfect  I am 6 2 on my tippy toes  Nice headroom  leg room  hip room  etc  Rear seat room is sufficient for short trips  Knee and hip room lack  but I don t have much need for the back seat  Well  ya know what I mean  With the seats folded flat  very nice for hauling pretty much anything you desire  I am not one for third row seats anyway  They tend to limit the second rows knee room  And see very little use anyway  For all you 2002 owners with your third row seats they are of course not leather  Come on Ford  you re selling your top end Eddie Bauer and Limited models with leather  while using vinyl for the third row seating surface  I don t know about you  but if I am paying  36K and up  that would not fly with me  Vinyl  Anyway  back to my ride  Great acceleration  Awesome 5 speed tranny  Take a spin  people  in a 4 speed automatic  and you will instantly appreciate your Explorer that much more  Above average suspension  Very good brakes   ABS  Fuel economy is not all that  but I and you should expect that in any SUV  A bit on the tippy side when strong winds are a blowing  Minnesota winters can be nasty on occasion  And when it s windy be on alert  This of course  carries over from the Bronco II model  An Explorer Sport is basically a revised Bronco II  which were known for there compulsion to do the 2 wheel tango  A bit more stable with this model however  The side step rails that come with the Sport model do tend to rust  I suggest waxing those while you re waxing the body  It may help a little  I was considering the purchase of a new 2002 Explorer Sport After thinking back on the lack of CS  I quickly came to my senses  On the  02 model  I just can t get passed the plastic bottom  I realize most cars are plastic in this area  but at least they are painted plastic  Call me picky  it just looks cheap  And now Ford is cutting costs even more by moving to a plastic fuel door  to which was once metal  I am sure Ford has stocked up on there inventory of this part  Very easy to snap off if one is not careful filling up there tank  One last thing  Ford s extended warranties  I did not purchase one with mine  Here is why  I previously purchased a 1998 Ford Mustang GT with 46K on it  Three years old at the time  Problem after problem  my fault for buying a used 0 60 car  I know  But  there were so many problems  and not one item was covered under the warranty  It is safe to say  if you decide on purchasing an extended warranty from Ford  mine cost  1100  it will cover the engine  the tranny  and the drivetrain  That is it  Everything else is thrown under  wear and tear  Be prepared for a few headaches if you need to use it  Not to mention trying to get a loaner car from Ford  Holy nightmare  Six times in 3 months I was in for repair  Nothing covered under warranty and I had to call at least 7 days in advance for a loaner car  Not to handy when you need repair asap  is it AGAIN  it s wise to make friendly with your local mechanic down the road  Unless Ford can improve greatly on the CS this will no doubt be my last Ford  For me  quality in the vehicle is equal to quality customer service  Love the ride  just not the ride to the dealership
