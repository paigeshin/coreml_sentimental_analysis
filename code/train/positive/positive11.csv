 We traded in my Saturn for a 1997 Windstar after traveling with our older son when he was an infant  The Windstar drives just like a littler car like a Saturn  which I still miss on occasions  but gives you much more room to pack things in  Now with two children I could never imagine getting them  us and all of our stuff in the smaller car for a trip  We fill the van to the brim I feel very comfortable driving the van and have had very little maintenance trouble with it  We recently took it in for the 45 000 mile tune up and everything came out fine  The only thing that we notice is that the  quot check engine quot  light comes on frequently when we take long trips  It was explained to us that when you go up or down in elevation quickly it comes on no big deal  It goes off after the car is started several times  We have yet to replace the tires and have replaced the brakes once but they were under warranty still Overall it is a great drive  We will be trading in for a new one when our lease is up in a couple years br br
