 I never even gave a thought to drive any sort of Ford vehicle until it came time to replace my 1987 Subaru GL hatchback with 160 000 miles  There it was in the Capital District Auto Guide  staring me in the face  My Moonlight Blue Clearcoat Metallic 1995 Thunderbird  It just looked like a really sweet car  The color and the white letter tires on it did it  The right price  and the right mileage  38 000  ensured that my dad would be willing to co sign the loan  Two problems  rear wheel drive and 3 8 liter V6  We live in New York  I m a young kid and I ve only driven tiny Subaru s  but fortunately  he went for it anyway  I dragged my sister down to the dealership with me and we took it for a test drive  The dealer started it  and I was very enthusiastic about the sound of the engine  The car was beautiful  and kept very clean  I drove it and was amazed by the way it handled and the way it felt just to be in the driver s seat  Of course  it could have been because I d never driven such a powerful car before  and nothing newer than a 1990  my father s Daytona  I put a deposit down on the car that day  I went home  My dad said  it s cool  I took the next day off work and got insurance and purchasing matters taken care of  It was mine  I could pick it up that night If only the rest of the process had gone so smoothly  I couldn t pick the car up from the dealer for almost a week because there was  900 worth of work to be done to it  Why hadn t it been done before the car was put up for sale  I DON T CARE  I WANT MY T BIRD  GIMMIE  Finally I got the car and about a week later  the oil pressure gauge would slip down to 0 and the Check Gauges light would come on every time I stopped at a stoplight  Now  in my Subie s  the oil pressure would slip down at a stoplight  but the light would never come on  and it was normal  In the Thunderbird  the oil pressure gauge stood steadily in the middle all the time  And the light coming on caused me to have all sorts of worry  But besides that  it ran fine  I brought it into the shop and it needed a new oil pump  they said  I ended up in a rental car  driving an Escort  Wonderful  The car was supposed to be in the shop a week  but it was only there for three days  I went and got the car back and that night  sure enough  I stopped at a light on the way to work and the oil pressure went down to low and the light came on  I screamed and hit the horn    Then I drove to work and had it towed in  Of course  it got towed to the wrong dealership  Then  they found out that I had somehow blown a bearing in the crankshaft  I was none too happy to hear about that  But it was fixed for free  and I figured that if something else substantial happened to it  I could apply the Lemon Law to it but after that  it ran just dandy  I ve had a few problems with it  my gas line started to leak because it had been rubbing up against a sharp edge on the gas tank and it rotted  but this was covered by my warranty  the cruise control module broke  the windshield washer fluid no longer dispenses  and last but not least  one day I came back from lunch and went to shut the car off to find that the car WOULD NOT shut off  I had to have the battery disconnected and have it towed  Come to find out  some plastic pin had broken off inside the steering column  and I had to pay for just labor   And this was at the first day of my new job  Thanks  car  Not covered by warranty  Figure that one out  But after the pieces of doody I ve driven this stuff is all minor  Now the car has 78 000 miles on it  and I hope nothing else goes wrong with it  the warranty is up  I have taken this car on so many road trips it s amazing  I live in Albany  and I drive to Massachusetts all the time  I ve driven to Cape Cod twice  I drove to Manhattan once  And one time going to Cape Cod and the drive to Manhattan were both complete spur of the moment trips  I ve owned the car for almost two years now and put 42 000 miles on it  That s twice the average  Considering how much I drive this car and pound the doody out of it  the things that have gone wrong with it are pretty insignificant  It s a beautiful car  lots of potential for modifications  I only wish for a V8  leather  5 speed  and I think instead of buying a new car  I want to trade this in on a  97 with the V8 and leather  I put a Kenwood deck in it  all new Kenwood speakers in the doors and in the rear  I had the basic cassette tape player when I bought the car  and I thought it was terrible  a Kenwood changer in the trunk and 2 12 quot  JL Audio s and a Kicker amp in the trunk  Even with all that stuff in the trunk  I can still fit a good amount of groceries back there  And there s always the backseat  It s usually just me and Dave in the car  so I don t even worry about it  but I find that the backseat is pretty damn big compared to the Subaru s I ve driven and the Escort s and Sentra s you see all over the place  I have the 3 8 liter V6  and it s quick  but it could be a lot quicker  The  99 Jetta my dad s driving now is a lot quicker  But with the Thunderbird  highway driving is something else  It feels like you re at a standstill doing 80  I ve never had that before  It s one of the best feelings in the world  And speeding up on the highway is very effortless  I can make the tires squeal pretty easily  I love rear wheel drive  I just put studded tires on the back last winter and didn t have a problem at all in the snow  I didn t even have anything in the trunk except the speakers  I feel pretty powerful driving this beast  too  It s comfortable and the car is very responsive  I can take curves at a very scary speed  I got into an accident with this car  wrecked the front end on some poor kid s Saab in the rain while trying to merge  and when I drove the rental  Lumina  I noticed how badly it handled around curves  and then I realized that I d taken the Thunderbird s handling for granted  it handled a lot better than anything else I d driven I love this car so much  I really want a  97 with a V8 and leather  and I m not real thrilled about the job the body shop did on the front end  and I m also really scared because of all those head gasket horror stories but this car is like a part of me  I love being able to tell people that I drive a Thunderbird  And I want to be able to do that as long as possible  and I know I can t spend forty grand next year I also have turned into a car snob Because this car just screams  quot BEEFCAKE quot  while all these pimped out Honda Civics try to do the same but come on I give it a ten  Chuck Shame I can t post a picture br br
