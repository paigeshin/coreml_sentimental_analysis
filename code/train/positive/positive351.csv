 I bought my 1993 ford Taurus a few months ago and I m totally pleased  I purchased it mainly because for an older used car  it had very low mileage and was kept in great condition with 1 owner  I have to say the size of the car took a little while to get used to since I had only had compact size before  It drives smoothly and only had to make 1 repair since I purchased it  And that was something small  a hose  The mileage is fairly good for a bigger car  Any used car should be looked at as that a used car  Don t expect to have no problems  especially with a 7 year old car  However  in my case  I am extremely pleased with my purchase  I would suggest this car for people who have a medium sized family and don t want something too large
