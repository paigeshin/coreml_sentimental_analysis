 I had leased a Ford Taurus for 3 years  and although not too flashy or great in any one area  it is a pretty nice set of wheels  Its dependable  runs smooth and with no problems at all in my experience  Once the automatic locked doors weren t functioning properly  and needed to be fixed  but that was most likely an isolated problem to my car The interior is comfortable and it is relaxing to sit in  Althought a  quot compact quot  car  it doesn t really feel like it as there s plenty of space  It also seems that your a bit higher up while driving  also giving the feel of more room compared to smaller cars The exterior of the taurus is although plain and common looking  still pretty good There isn t much bad to say about this car  though it isn t the greatest either  I do recommend it to anyone who is intrested in buying a car  all ages  families  single people  it doesn t matter  this car can fit you br br
