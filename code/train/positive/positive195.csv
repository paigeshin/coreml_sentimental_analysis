 I drove this van for nearly a year after my first car got stolen  and let me tell you  what a piece of work  I proceeded to drive it like a NASCAR  but it held up  with a spectacular V8 engine supplying all of the horsepower i needed for my various missions  Let s talk about interior  This beauty had everything  mood lights  fully reclining seats  a fold out bed in back  a cooler  curtains  and a cable TV hookup  among various other things  In essence  it was  a van of the gods  with no other vehicle before or since  with the exception of my Cadillac  even coming close to matching its splendor and pure sex appeal  It was asthetically marvelous  with boxy but smooth lines  and a ladder on back in case you had to get up on the roof for something  Don t turn corners too fast  or it will tip over  If all of this doesn t make you teary eyed with joy  you are either a  an alien  or b  a communist  Plus it has alloy wheels  and you can install tables in the middle and back seat rows  If anyone ever claims to make a more feature ridden behemoth  they are lying  A definite buy
