 If you had told me when I was 21 that I would be driving a station wagon within 5 years I would probably have laughed myself into a stuper  Well I was 23 when I decided that my kids and I had outgrown my little Calais and we needed something with more room  so I started looking for the perfect vehicle and I found it very quickly  My sister and I had been out and about when we first saw the  89 FOrd Taurus Wagon sitting there on the lot saying  quot buy me  buy ME quot  but I passed it off as  quot probably too expensive quot  Well with out my knowing about it my sister went to the lot and asked about the car for me  It was a 1989 Ford Taurus Wagon with 100 some odd thousand miles on it  air conditioner  AM FM radio tape  electric seats  locks and windows  rear defrost  and a few more nice little odds and ends  and the price was ONLY  2500  Well I called my loan man and he said offer  2100  they took it and I was the proud owner of a very roomy  and trustworthy vehicle  I had that vehicle for over a year when I decided to buy a new  used  vehicle  but the only reason I decided to get a new one was because my family was growing  I now had myself  my 3 kids  my fiance  and his daughter    amp  now one on the way  so we talked it over and decided to get a Mini Van  I still miss my wagon but I realize that for a family of 5 it is perfect but when you have a family of 7 that you need a bigger vehicle  If you are a family of 5 or more and looking for a nice  roomy vehicle the Ford Taurus is the perfect family vehicle but if there are more than of you it starts getting crowded br br
