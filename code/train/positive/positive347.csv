 I bought my 1993 Ford Explorer because I wanted a bigger vehicle to haul around all my and my brother s stuff  For hauling it s great  It even tows very well  I towed my brother s boat 400 miles with absolutely no problems  It handles great with no real problems  and putting it in 4 wheel drive is easy  just push a button  My biggest problem is that in the winter I m from Iowa  this vehicle does not stop very well on snow or ice  Unlike most vehicles that may slide slightly  my Explorer is all over the road  You have to start stopping over a block before the stop sign  Anyone is fair weather climate should have no problems with this vehicle  Its great for hauling all of your things and towing your boats  etc  and it gets around great br br
