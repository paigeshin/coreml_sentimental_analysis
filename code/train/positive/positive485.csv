 I bought my Ford F150 Lariet Supercrew 4x4 about a month ago  I haven t found anything that I don t like about it  I love the way it handles much better that the explorer that I traded in  The interior is wonderful  the leather is very durable  I can seat 6 people  the backseat is very roomy even with three kids in it  The bed extender is handy  I ve hauled a full size mattress and box springs  and the power is awesome  If you can get one with a moon roof  do it  It is a fun option  We are a family of 5 and totally enjoy this truck  The gas mileage is better than I thought it would be  My truck is black and requires lots of baths  but there is nothing that compares with a shiny new black truck
