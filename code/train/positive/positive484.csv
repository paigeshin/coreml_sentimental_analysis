 I can t believe out test drive of the new 2001 Ford Super Crew F 150  It has the size and power of a full size work horse but one look inside will convince you   this is No ordinary truck  The stylish features include a two tone dash  extra plush seating  fashionable grab bars  well appointed easy to read dash  steering wheel controls  matching head rests  a handy center console plus drink containers and pockets in the door panels for extra storage  Also the roomy back seat could easily seat three adults and the back seats fold 40 60 to allow for lots of extra storage The ride was smooth as glass and plenty of pep for the highway  It was easy to handle in traffic and visibility was excellent as well  My husband  a GMC man  is built like a bear and he had too agree this truck has a lot to offer  The towing package also comes with a larger radiator for more efficient cooling while towing  The exterior color I really was drawn to was the new Island Blue  The bed is 5 5 quot  but there is an optional bar extension that will give you 7  of hauling space for  195 00  Great appeal for both the luxury details for the ladies and brute strength for the guys  Plus room for teenagers in the back seats   I recommend it for a terrific family vehicle
