 After buying and driving small cars  Hondas  Saturns  even an MG for the past twenty years I was uncertain about going the SUV route  But  as my interests now require me to have more room for hauling around equipment  I scuba dive I needed a vehicle that had more room The Explorer has all the room one needs yet also has the  quot car quot  feel I was so afraid to lose  As I also commute over 100 miles per day to work this vehicle has gotten a rigorous workout  100 000 miles in three years  and has not given me a single headache It truly is a utility vehicle  it has the class and looks for going to a formal wedding yet makes itself right at home at the camp ground  I am not a rugged individual  actually a short 40 year old woman  this vehicle has not only changed the way I feel about SUV s and trucks in general I will most certainly purchase another SUV  and probably another Explorer  when the time to trade in come around  But after over 100 000 miles the car looks and drives like new  so that may not be for quite sometime br br
