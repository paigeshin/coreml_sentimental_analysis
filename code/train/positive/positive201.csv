 IU think that the explorer should atleast have the 90  mark on this chart not the 87  that like a B  and i personally would give it a A  its one of the smartest  I purchased my Explorer on Jan 5 99 i have had it a year already and i have to say its excellent it rides like a baby and i love that  i truly would recomended this car to anyone who wants something that will last practically forever and very dependable on the road i enjoy my 4x4 espicailly when i got exactly what i want for only 27 125 00 for it   GET one today youll love it   you will be very safe in it in all the crash test ive read 2 companies said it was a  quot excellent quot  and 3 said quot good quot  and 1 said acceptable and other than that NO poors or marginal thats great  i want something that is safe and well assembled  very carefully put together GET ONE TODAY br br
