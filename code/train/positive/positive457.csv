 The lease on our Ford Explorer was due to end in 5 months  150 my wife and I were planning on letting it lapse and replace it with another  smaller SUV The letter from Ford Motor Credit changed all that  Basically  their  147Early Bird 148 program would allow us to trade the Explorer in early  with Ford making the last 5 lease payments  if we bought or leased another Ford product  We hadn 146t thought too seriously about another Ford  but realized that our daughter was going to be 16 soon  so we thought that perhaps a Focus was in our future  So  off to the dealer we went Ford produces 4 different models of the Focus  a 2 door hatchback  ZX3  a 4 door hatchback  ZX5  a sedan and a traditional station wagon  Since the car was ultimately going to be our daughters  she came with us to help pick out  147her 148 car  The 2 door was out  as I felt it would be more expensive to insure than a 4 door vehicle  She immediately ruled out the wagon  which left the sedan and the 4 door hatchback  We drove one of each  and decided that the versatility of the hatchback was a nice feature not found on too many cars  That  plus the looks didn 146t scream  147Gramma mobile 148  with apologies to all grandmothers reading this It took trips to 4 different dealers  but we finally found one that we liked  a Sangria Red  burgundy to the rest of the world  ZX5 with a stick shift and ABS We 146ve had the car now for a couple of weeks and here are my impressions after 300 miles Styling  150 Interior and Exterior The Focus  particularly in hatchback form  has some interesting styling details  150 the car was designed when Ford was going through their  147New Edge 148 styling phase  the late Mercury Cougar was also a product of this era  The taillights  for example  are not at bumper level  but rather up in the rear pillars  on either side of the hatchback glass  Odd  but also strangely cool to my middle aged eyes  In addition  the red of our car almost  147hides 148 the taillights altogether during the day  Triangular headlamps at the front blend in to the character of the car as well  The use of angles and curves that intersect are also interesting  150 beauty is in the eye of the beholder  I suppose  but no one in my family dislikes the looks of the car The same theme dominates the inside of the vehicle as well  150 there are lots of diagonal slashes across the dashboard  and the organization of the stereo and HVAC controls is quite easy to master  My daughter  especially  liked the big digital readout of the stereo and how close it is to the driver  The only thing I find odd  and it seems to be endemic to Fords  is the lack of a redline mark on the tachometer  Especially for a new driver  knowing how fast the engine can rev before bad things start to happen is something pretty important Interior Space On our first test drive  I actually rode in the back seat  My wife drove  and our daughter rode shotgun  I was impressed by the amount of room I had  both for my legs and my head  I truly thought the sloping roof design of the hatchback was going to restrict headroom  but that wasn 146t the case  Now  I will admit that I could not see myself riding in the backseat on a cross country road trip  but for a trip of a few hours  I could be reasonably comfortable I actually did not get to drive the car for a few days  when I did  I was again surprised at how much room I had  The seats are height adjustable  on our trim level  which is known as  147Comfort 148  so I could put a couple of inches between the top of my head and the roof  The steering wheel adjusts for both reach and rake  meaning the wheel goes in and out as well as up and down   150 this translates into a driver 146s seat that 98  of the population should be able to get comfortable with  The gearshift falls readily to the right hand  and I 146ve already mentioned the stereo and HVAC controls  Sight lines are good  there really are not any major blind spots  150 again  something important for the first time driver  The only thing that takes a moment to get used to  150 and it is really only a problem if you have driven other stick shift equipped cars  150 is that to find reverse  a ring has to be pulled up on the gearshift before putting the gear lever into that spot  The first time my wife had to back up  she had to look up in the owner 146s manual how to do this The Driving Experience In Europe  the Focus is hailed by many of the car magazines as one of the best handling small cars available  Here in the United States  the Focus has been on Car and Driver magazine 146s  14710 Best Cars 148 for 5 straight years After driving the Focus  I can see why these accolades are heaped upon the Ford  For a small car  it goes  stops and turns quite nicely  Our ZX5 has the 2 0 liter  147Zetec 148 engine  which makes 130 horsepower  Completely adequate  I must say  Coupled with the smooth shifting 5 speed  the Focus has no problem getting out of its own way  The space between gears is nice and short  and the clutch action is smooth and predictable   again  nice traits for a first car We test drove a Focus with an automatic  and while that might have been a better fit for our daughter  my wife and I both believe that you have more control over your car with a stick shift  especially when poor weather hits  In addition  the automatic takes all the verve out of the engine  you practically have to floor it to keep the momentum up Ride and handling are also above par  While it won 146t ever be confused with a Lexus for ride quality or a BMW for carving corners  the Focus can more than hold its own  The suspension has evidently been tuned by Ford to strike a nice compromise between a cushy ride and good cornering capabilities  On the highway  the only complaint I might have is a bit too much road noise from the tires  Goodyear RS A  size 195 60 15  But  since the car will be used mainly for urban commuting  I don 146t see that as too much of a problem One last note  150 we got about 6 148 of snow last night  and my wife told me that driving the Focus to work this morning was really not too bad  150 the combination of the high seating position and the stick shift gave her the confidence to get to work with little or no drama  Summary For not a lot of money  about  15K in our case  we got a car filled with creature comforts  power windows  locks and mirrors  keyless remote  a CD MP3 player and cruise control  safety amenities  ABS and dual air bags  150 side air bags and traction control are optional  and enough character to hopefully keep our daughter safe and happy for many years to come  Our first tank of gas returned just over 29 miles per gallon  so it should be inexpensive to run
