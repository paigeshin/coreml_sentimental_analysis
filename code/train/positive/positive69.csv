 I didn t buy my Expedition so I could run errands in town  or drive my kids to practice  I bought it to tow our 5000 lb travel trailer and all of our camping gear  We couldn t have picked a better truck  With the 5 4 liter V8  3 92 limited slip rear end  and heavy duty tow package  we can pull 7300 lbs  The step up is very high  but once inside you re greeted by a panoramic view around you  A great feature is the power adjustable pedals which have a range of 4 inches  Believe me  they really make a difference  There is a 14 inch height differential between my wife and I  but we can both find a comfortable driving position  More importantly  my wife can remain a safe distance from the steering wheel air bag Reliability has been stellar  Based on the time tested F 150 chassis  the Expedition has proven itself both durable and reliable  Our experience has borne this out  After 6 months  15 000 miles and several towing trips  my Expedition has required only one unscheduled service call to repair a slow leak in one tire  yes  Firestone Wilderness   all four of which will be replaced by Ford in the next several weeks Gas mileage is a big drawback  I have averaged about 14 8 miles per gallon in mixed driving   10 when towing the trailer  But  again  I didn t buy it to replace my minivan  If you don t tow  you probably don t need the 5 4l engine  But even if you don t tow  the Expy offers size  safety and security for your family
