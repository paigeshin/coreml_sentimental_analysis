 I own the limited version of this vehicle and also have a large family  I ve had an Expedition which I was very happy with for the past two years but we are currently selling it  Unfortunately our family has outgrown it  One of the reasons for buying the Excursion is the extra room behind the 3rd seat which the Expedition didn t offer  There is plenty of room for strollers  suitcases  camping gear  etc Most the complaints about this vehicle is that it is too large and uses too much gas  People with large families really don t have many choices when it comes to a vehicle which is able to carry the entire load  I didn t want to buy two vehicle which together would use more gas than the Excursion alone  While I knew I needed a large vehicle common sense also tells me that the gas mileage would be poor  While many people think this is by far the largest vehicle  minus semi s  buses and RVs on the road I must disclose that this is not true  The Excursion is 226 7 quot  long  80 quot  wide and 79 5 quot  high and 7150 lbs  The Super Duty Crew Cab 350 Pickup is 257 6 quot  long  95 5 quot  wide  5604 lbs  and unknown height  That s a difference of almost 31 quot  in length and 15 5 quot  in width  The shorter truck version is 241 4 quot  long  The 150 Super Duty Crew Cab is 225 9 quot  long 79 8 quot  wide and 77 2 quot  high  This is almost the same size as the Excursion  The trucks and Excursion obtain about the same gas mileage 12 MPG give or take about 1 mile to the gallon although the Excursion Power Stroke engine is about 17 MPG  The Excursion obviously weights more but it also has to protect more passengers  These figures are based on 2000 and 2001 truck models All seats in the Excursion offer generous leg  head and elbow room  I have even sat in the 3rd row seat very comfortably  The seats are very comfortable for long trips I have the 7 3 L Power Stroke diesel engine which obtains about 17 MPG compared to the 12 MPG of the other version  Personally  other than the recent spike of gas prices which is already working its way back down  I have no complaints in the amount of gas I need to buy  The 17 MPG is very comparable to the many mini vans on the road Once you familiarize yourself with this vehicle  it s surprisingly maneuverable and easy to park  It drives and rides smoothly and handles corners with ease If you re in the market for an Expedition  take your time in test driving it and contemplate what you will use it for because it isn t for everyone but I am extremely happy with it
