 We recently purchsed this truck after years of driving a small to mid sized vehicle this was a huge change  But after having our 3rd baby we needed something to haul everyone around in  I am not a  mini van chick  I flat out refused to drive one so my husband and I started investigating the SUV s  After months of reading  talking and searching we decided on the Ford Expedition Im very please with it  I was a little worried about how I would handle a large vehicle but it is surprisingly easy to drive  parking is a wee but tight on occasion but so far I havent had a huge problem  We opted for the 4x2 XLT version  really no need for the 4x4 when driving to the super market and school  plus thats just one extra thing that could go wrong in the future  Ours has all the bells and whistles including the rear air  which is a great thing when you have 3 kids in the back  I was advised to get the  big  motor  the 5 4 liter but we ended up with the 4 6  which has PLENTY of power and is much easier on the gas bill  Though my husband claims he wants to put a super charger in it I think not  It has the 3rd row of seats which was a huge selling point for me  my children are now seperated and have zero reason to fight no more  MOM  he s touching me  it is so very peaceful and makes me much more relaxed nothing worse than a stressed mom behind the wheel The only down fall is that there isnt a whole lot of cargo space when the 3rd seat is in  We recently took a trip for the weekend  all of us  and it was packed to the hilt  especially since we have an infant and god knows they need so much equipment when away from home I would highly recommend this truck to anyone who wants the space of a mini van without the minivan look
