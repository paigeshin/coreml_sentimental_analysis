 It finally arrived  I waited nine months for Ford to fill my order for a 2002 T bird  It was love at first sight  and at first drive I m someone who does not know a lot about mechanics  but is impressed by detail and design  The 2002 T bird is obviously a car engineered with passion  From the powerful motor and firm suspension right down to the chrome trimmed cup holders  this is a car that exudes style and quality This car drives nearly silent with the optional hard top on  Take the hard top off and it is still very quiet inside  even at highway speeds  Conversation is easy  though the fantastic Bose stereo system with CD changer may have you cranking up the tunes  Ford makes a big point of saying that this car is a  cruiser  and not intended to be a Porshe like sports car  It s a car to drive around town in and a car to enjoy a road trip  What is surprising is that the tight suspension and responsive V 8 do give the driver a real thrill  It s all the performance I could possibly use in a car  and I m not gentle with the gas when I drive a car If you are worried about room inside  don t be  I m 6 1  and the car is comfortable and fun  with or without the hard top on  It is even more fun without the top  of course  This really is a two seater  though  It s a good size car  so many people assume that there must be a small seat or shelf hidden back there  There is not  The trunk is surprisingly spacious  I haven t put my clubs in it yet  but I don t anticipate a problem  My father  who owned one of the  57s that inspired the 2002  recently told me   Everyone should own a car like this once in their life  It s true  This car is a thing of beauty  A bit of advice  California dealers were marking up the T birds  10 000 15 000  depending on the color  So  I ordered mine from a Florida dealer  had them ship it to me  and paid very close to sticker  If you really want this car  be patient  They all get built at the same factory  so check around the country for the dealer willing to give you the best price October update to this review  I ve got a couple of thousand miles on the T bird now really driven this car  It s better than ever  No regrets on this purchase  Though the trunk is small  I regularly cart around two sets of golf clubs  I ve driven the car three hundred miles in a single day and found it comfortable  The sound system is just amazing  Now that it is  broken in  it sounds just fantastic  I actually prefer listening to CDs in the car  rather than my home theater system  Lessons learned  carry sunscreen in the car and a leather jacket in the trunk and it s almost never necessary to put up the top  Now that the engine has a few thousand miles on it  I drive the car more aggressively  Wow  what a blast  This thing hauls  The low center of gravity and wide tires also makes for nice cornering  What is really interesting is how people react to this piece of new Americana  Older folks remember the 50 s T birds and are happy to see  it s back  The younger skateboarding crowd often yell  cool car  when I drive by and I wonder if they even know that this car is based on a 1950s style  Six months after my purchase  I still strongly recommend this vehicle  My advice remains the same  though  Don t pay a big mark up on the vehicle  They are out there and you can ship a car across country for a couple hundred bucks  I had mine built at Ford from and order placed by a Florida dealer and then shipped to a fleet center in Dublin  California  I never met the salesman I bought the car from  but then again I didn t pay the  6 000 mark up my local dealer wanted to charge me  Be patient  This car is worth waiting for
