 We are the proud owners of a 1999 Ford Explorer XLT  We purchased it because we wanted a vehilcle that can handle western New York winters  carry two adults and two older teenage sons  and pull a large  quot pop up quot  camper trailer  At the same time  I didn t want to sacrifice gas mileage as you do with larger suvs  So far  we have been quite pleased with the Explorer  It pulls our trailer  about 2000 lbs  without a problem  with only some loss of gas mileage  When not towing  gas mileage averages around fifteen miles per gallon  or slightly better  Although it doesn t have the soft comfortable ride of our old  89 Crown Victoria  the ride quality is pretty good  With the SOHC V6 engine  there is some noticeable engine and road surface noise   nothing more than you would expect with a truck The vehicle handles very well and is easy to park and maneuver in parking lots  After driving an extended  94 Aerostar mini van  the Explorer seems much smaller and easier to navigate  However  we do miss the third passenger seat and the additional cargo space of the larger Aerostar  But  we have taken several longer trips  300 or more miles  with the Explorer and have managed to have enough room for luggage  cooler chest  Christmas packages  etc  When my wife are using the vehicle around town  we love it for size and convenience There has been one recall so far   replacement of the secondary hood latch which was handled promptly by the dealer  Just last week  we noticed that cold air seems to be coming in through the left rear door speaker  The dealer corrected this by adding insulation to the door  no charge  Overall  the quality craftsmanship of the vehicle is quite good Overall  if you want a SUV that has decent gas mileage and is smaller than the Expedition  Excursion  or Suburban  the Ford Explorer is a good choice  If you need larger towing capacity  or want more cargo capacity  then you will have to sacrifice gas mileage and go with one of the larger vehicles 1 14 2000 Update Well  winter driving has arrived in western NY  and today I found out how well the Explorer handles on slippery  snow packed roads  and I am very pleased with the results  On roads that were somewhat slippery for my Aerostar  the Explorer felt very stable and would not skid or fishtail when I pushed it a bit  So  I ll update this review again when I get a chance to play in some deep snow br br
