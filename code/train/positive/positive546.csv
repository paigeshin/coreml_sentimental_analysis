 We live on a small farm and needed a truck to haul feed and livestock  Since our children are now teens we knew that the extended cab was ready to be upgraded to a full crew cab  The full crew cab gives plenty of room for up to six people  This pickup handles all of our family s needs  It is a workhorse for the farm and a pleasure to drive  and ride in  as a  quot family car quot  The 4 wheel drive is great when it comes time to get hay out of the field  or when off road  The power stroke diesel gives all the power you could want when passing on the highway  even when hauling or pulling a load  The new  quot scalloped quot  front driver and passenger windows are really a great help for seeing small cars beside you  This is a great vehicle for people that need to haul and have a family  Because of the relatively low gas mileage I would not recommend it for total pleasure use or for singles or couples  Although the diesel engine gets better mileage than a gas engine br br
