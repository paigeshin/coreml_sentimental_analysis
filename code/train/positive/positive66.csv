 I bought a 1992 Ford Taurus LX about 1 1 2 years ago  and haven t had any problems with it at all  Aside from regularly scheduled maintenance and the fact that I got into an accident  I haven t had to take this car to the shop for anything  The car has 108 000 miles on it now  I bought it with 97 000  and the engine is still as smooth as silk  It has a lot of power behind it  wiht a 3 3L V6 EFI engine  The front seat is roomy and has lots of features  but the back seat can tend to be cramped  especially with me driving  but for smaller people is still very roomy  I wouldn t giv this car up for anything right now and will keep it until it finally dies for the last time br br
