 Well I don t know where to start about my rig  My wife and I recently had a lil boy  and the truck we had a 1998 Dodge Dakota Sport extended cab was just not big enough to handle a car seat in the back for the lil man  My wife called me one day while she was out of town and told me that I should start shopping for a new rig  So that was what I started doing  I new that Chevy was coming out with a new Super Duty rig  I also knew that Dodge made a good 2500 rig  So in all fairness I really started shopping around  I drove the new Chevys  Dodges  and the Fords  In fact one dealership went to the local Chevy and Dodge dealerships and borrowed a brand new 2500 Chevy and 2500 Dodge  Both gas engines  I drove them both then drove the Ford again  He then brought over a Chevy 2500 diesel and a Dodge 2500 diesel  Drove both of them  and again as before I drove the Ford again  Well to make a long story short  I literally took one month to shop for a truck  Now here are the reasons why I chose the Ford over the competition  1  The Ford drives like a truck  I personally buy a truck to ride like a truck  Not a Cadillac  The Chevy truck yes is a very beautiful rig  however when going down a bumpy road I didn t feel to of the road  Personally that is not what I want  I want to be able to feel the road  2  The Dodge transmissions have been known to have a lot of problems  I personally had to have the transmission of my Dakota replaced 2 times  When I was looking for a truck I went to a very close friend that just happened to be the service manager of the local Dodge dealership  He informed me that the fullsize trucks have more problems with their transmissions than any other truck on the market  3  The Dodge Diesel was the loudest diesel on the market  Even in the cab of the truck the knocking of the engine could be heard  4  The Ford V 10 was by far the most powerful gas engine on the market  The Ford was a lil less roomy than the Chevy  but it road like a truck should ride  Like a truck  The Ford Diesel was by far the well excuse my French but it was the ballsiest diesel I have ever driven  I was sitting at a stop lite and I punched it with out even thinking about  Wow  Is the only thing I could say  The truck actually squawked its tires at the line and was in the process of spinning them when I let off the accelerator  That was very impressive in my mind  I bought my truck which has the following options  F 250 Super Duty XLT  V 10  Supercab  4x4  Air Conditioning  Stereo cassette  CD Player  3 75 rear end  towing package  towing mirrors  Not a lot of options  But it is by far the dream truck that I have always wanted  I can t think of a better truck to own  I am currently in the process of making it my absolute dream truck  I have been told that with a 3 inch lift a set of 38 will fit just fine  Well I am about to find out  Well since I put this e pinion on here  I have made some changes to my truck  It is now 6 inches taller with 35 s underneath  And one hell of a lot more powerful  The only cons that I have is the seat belt design in the front and the lack of child seat anchor points  As fas as the seat belts  well I am a large man and when I get out of the truck if I am in a hurry and don t look back my seat belts get all tangled up in the door when it closes  And the child seat anchors are something that all vehicles should have in them  but you have to order them from the dealer  and then they will put them in  Thankfully free  These are my only complaints
