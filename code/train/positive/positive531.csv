 When I bought my first Explorer I owned a Town Car by Lincoln  I never felt very comfortable in it because I always felt it was not me  When I traded it for my Explorer I felt like I had been liberated  I have more fun driving this car than any I have ever owned  I now own my second Explorer and will buy another when the time comes to trade  This is a perfect car for me because I travel a lot and I feel very safe in it and also I am a grandmother to four wonderful children  They have a great time riding with me  The only time I feel uncomfortable is on Sunday going to church and I have so far to step up in a dress  This is a great car and I do recommend it br br
