 Well what to say about the ford explorer limited besides that it is GREAT  I recently bought a 1996 ford explorer limited with 54 000 miles for  14 000  Which I consider a very good price considering that Kelly Blue Book value is  20 000  www kellybluebook com Since the limited is top of the line  the interior is luxurious and comfortable  There is an electronic control center that gives me such information as gas usage and oil information as well as much other useful info  I bought this explorer for it s handsome looks  widespread popularity  and size  It does what I want when I want it to  I also like how my passengers in the back receive rear air  an option in XLT and up  Also the windows in the back go farther down than a Chevy Tahoe  The explorer is capabale of off roading  I know so because I have gone off roading  it is not the best but does what any soccer mom sport utility is capable of  The running boards hit A LOT of times when heading off the trail  So if y ou plan on off roading  then do not get them  Also the factory running boards are narrow and hard to use  I do not recommend them  An aftermarket supplier can supply great ones  Now let s hear about the cons  THE ENGINE  I would definetly go with the V8 In 1996 the V8 was not available so I have a 4 0 V6 with 160 horsepower  My wifes 1999 Ford Taurus SE has a 200 horsepower V6  Also  some of the interior is plastic feeling and kinda cheap looking  I have had no problems and my carfax report was 100  clear  I definetly recommend this versatile sport utility to anyone with the need for it or for anyone who wants some comfortable driving br br
