 The 1999 2000 Mustang has got to be the most affordable sports car in it class  Averaging between  18 000 and  22 000 for the basic  5 speed  fully equipped model will outbeat any of it competition  Just the sound of the engine in the 5 speed when putting your foot on the gas will take your breath away I am only 26 years old  basically just getting my feet off the ground and always wanted my first new car to be a sports  and the Ford Mustang my that wish come true with it price and incentive programs  At any age  if you enjoy going fast and feeling power behind the wheel of your automobile when you put your foot on the gas  this car is for you Only downfall to this car  as well as all sports cars  is the lack of ability to drive it in the rain and snow without fear of losing control because of the rear wheel drive and lack of weight in the trunk area br br
