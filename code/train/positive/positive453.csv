 There were two main reasons why I purchased this vehicle and why I will purchase it again  The first reason was price  This car was truly in my price range and I got a great deal from the dealer I purchased it from  My car payments were right were I needed them to be at the time  yet I had just purchased very dependable transportation and transportation that leads me to my second point on purchasing this vehicle  Very good gas mileage  This was extremely important because I drive 70 miles round trip daily to and from work  When I purchased the Escort gas prices were just about where they are now  approximately  1 25 a gallon  This vehicle has averaged approximately 37 miles to the gallon  so it is costing me less than  2 50 a day for gas  When I drive my other vehicle it costs me twice as much in gas As gas prices continue to go up  I would strongly recommend that people look at this vehicle for a very dependable and economical means of transportation br br
