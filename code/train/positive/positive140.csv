 Real Truck people know who 146s got it in the compact class  most would agree  147nobody but nobody 148 can touch Ford 146s Ranger  Although the Japanese may have an advantage in car sales they remain on the outside looking in when it comes to trucks  GM has never been a serious contender with the S 10 and Dodge is only starting to make some inroads with the Dakota  Quite simply  none match the build quality Ford puts into the Ranger For instance  I drove my last Ranger  a 1989 2WD for 13 years before recently upgrading to a slightly used 2001   4X4 Supercab Edge  During my ownership covering 110 000 miles I replaced one set of brakes and shocks  did one tune up  replaced a leaky valve cover gasket  several mufflers  two batteries and a water pump  Basically just routine maintenance  quite a record for any vehicle  especially one that cost just  9 000  For those of you that may not know  the Edge series comes with fewer goodies than the top of the line XLT  It lacks some of the finer things you 146d consider indispensable in an automobile such as tilt  power windows and locks  keyless entry etc  However this model was exactly what I was looking for as it contains a hose me out interior  The extra room the 4 door cab offers is great for hauling around my constant companion  a German Shepherd named Barney  Barney seems to have 3 times more hair than any dog his size would require  most of which he 146d leave behind where it would stick fast to the seats and carpeting of the previous truck  The Edge with its vinyl floor and seats  is one heck of a lot easier to vacuum and keep clean  And after all  this is a truck  not the family go to Sunday meeting luxury vehicle Having said that I must admit I was somewhat disappointed with our test drive of this vehicle  For one thing there was more engine noise and a much choppier ride than in my far older 2 wheel drive truck  The difference was very noticeable  so much so  we went home without purchasing the truck  much to the chagrin of our sales person I guess we just weren 146t prepared for the difference you 146ll find between the 2 wheel version and its bigger  147at least taller 148 4X4 brother  After some discussion my wife and I decided even though we preferred the 2 wheel suspension  a 4X4 would be better suited to our current needs  Point being if you don 146t live in snow country  unless you 146re into status that is  you 146ll be a lot more comfortable in a 2 wheel model  Here you 146ll find easier entry  since it 146s lower to the ground  in addition to a much softer ride Of course serious truck lovers wouldn 146t consider anything but a 4X4  why because they 146re macho  They just look bigger and meaner with their taller stance and huge tires  Often owning a 4X4 is all about image  not necessarily need  Maybe some of that was true with us too as the Edge 4X4 is one mean looking vehicle  It just says  147drive me 148 when sitting in our garage I consider the 3 0 V 6 sightly undersized  especially since the truck is rated to haul up to 5 000 lbs  can 146t help but wonder where they got that number  Ford must have known that because newer models come with the 4 0  a 50 HP boost  as standard equipment  Although the smaller engine is adequate for most needs and probably does better at the pumps  Gas mileage is in the 16 17 range  not exactly outstanding The fun to drive aspect is hard to measure  Ride is toward the harsh side  but the truck handles incredibly well and doesn 146t feel the least bit tippy unlike many SUV 146s  Seats are very comfortable  wind noise is minimal  I have noticed some creaking noises  undoubtedly attributable to the 4 door design that lacks the stabilizing nature of a center post  As noted earlier the vinyl interior of the Edge makes cleanup a breeze  Nevertheless it does make one wonder why Ford had to pad the seat backs with a velcro like cloth that nearly defeats the clean ability feature for dog lovers  The Ranger is literally bullet proof from a mechanical standpoint  Combine that with its good looks  rugged suspension  right size  flexible utility and fun to drive aspect  you have one heck of vehicle  It can haul wood  cruise effortlessly on the highway or carry campers through some of the worst terrain without taking a deep breath  And it retains its value better than 90  of all the other vehicles on the road  No wonder it 146s the number one selling compact truck  it sure gets my vote
