 After being in a horrible accident with the 5 of us in the van  I decided to look  quot only quot  for a mini van with the highest crash test ratings for safety  That is the only way for my family  Ford Windstar rated the best among all the mini vans on the market today  I love my Windstar  Its nice looking and very safe for my family  It has the ABS brakes  front and passenger side airbag  And the drop down motor in the case of a front crash to keep the motor from coming in on the driver and front passenger  Keyless entry  and for those of us with our hands full and unable to use the key to unlock the doors this is a great feature that I definately wanted and needed and its a wonderful thing to have  The seats and everything are nice inside and looks and feels great The price is right too for this nice mini van  And the style is a wonderful atribution to the Ford Family br br
