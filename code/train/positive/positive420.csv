 I recently purchased a new Ford Mustang and have nothing but good things to say about it  I had spent a lot of time looking at cars and doing research into what car I wanted  I had owned a Camaro before  and said I never wanted to have a Ford  Well  as I drove by the Ford dealership  the Mustang just jumped out at me  Something about that car really caught my attention  and why shouldn t it have  There are many perks to this car  First off  the Mustang is a legacy anyway  This car has a lot of history  Also  I really like what they have done with this new body style  As soon as I got in the car to test drive it  I knew it was the car for me  It has great power  good handling  good stereo system  and I like the inside a lot better than the Camaro  Not to mention  the price tag on it was very pleasing  too  After all the nonsense at the dealership  I ended up driving off the lot at around 18 000  Gotta give two thumbs up to Ford on this beauty br br
