 I walked into the Ford dealer near my house and saw this beauty  It was a Ford Mustang Gt  Red with black racing stripes on the hood and leather interior  I thought to myself for about 3 seconds then made a decision that I must have this car  Its absolutely beautiful and its an experience to drive each and everytime I get behind the wheel  Everyone stares at it and not to be a materialistic but it feels good to have something that people admire  It has a 4 6 liter engine V8 and it s power is unbelievable  I had other sports cares but this one tops all of them in the area of comfort  I absolutely adore this vehicle and recommend it to anyone with class and a desire for excitement and a little fast paced fun  The only bad thing is the gas  but i m willing to overlook that negative quality and again I will say you only live once so have fun and take chances br br
