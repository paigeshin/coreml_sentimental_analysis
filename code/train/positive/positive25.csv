 I 146ve never owned a pickup  and possibly never will  But I just had to drive the redesigned Ford F 150 as soon as it appeared on dealers  lots  Why  Ford s financial health has been shaky lately  and no product is more critical to this health than the company s full size pickup  the F 150  This truck  the best selling vehicle in the U S  for the last quarter century  contributes a major chunk of Ford s sales and profits  Consequently  as goes the new truck  so goes the company  Well aware of the stakes  Ford spared little when fully redesigning its large pickup for 2004   Partly as a result  the new F 150 is much more expensive to build than the old one  Given the importance of the new F 150 and the amount of effort Ford put into it  I felt compelled to check it out  Since I 146m not used to how large trucks drive  I also drove a Chevrolet and Dodge for comparison Note  This review is identical to that posted under the general F 150 heading  except that I ve added a section on reliability b Many  Many Choices  But which one  The new F 150 comes in five different models  base XL  work truck  low end sporty STX  midrange XLT  which will probably be most popular  high end sporty  off road ready FX4  and luxurious Lariat  Trim lines are just the beginning of the choices  Three bodies are available  regular cab  SuperCab  rear seat accessed by rear hinged half doors  and SuperCrew  larger rear seat accessed by four conventional doors  Going up one size cab will cost you about  2 500  Three bed lengths are available  5 5  6 5  and 8 feet  The 6 5 comes in both regular and Flareside styles  Going up a bed size costs  300  while the Flareside will set you back another  845 For 2004 two engines are available  both V8s  a largely carryover 231 horsepower 4 6 liter and an extensively upgraded 300 horsepower 5 4 liter  The latter  with three valves per cylinder and variable timing for higher efficiency and a broader torque curve  produces 365 foot pounds of torque at 3750 RPM  For 2005 there will be additional engines  includes a V6 and a supercharged V8  A manual transmission should also be available in later years  For now  either engine hooks up to a four speed automatic  Although this automatic is supposedly  147new 148 I would expect another before too long  as Dodge and  soon  Nissan offer five speed units Drivetrains include rear wheel drive  mechanical shift on the fly four wheel drive  and electronic shift on the fly four wheel drive  Unlike in Ford 146s large SUVs  automatically engaging all wheel drive is not available  As in other large pickups  many different axle ratios with and without limited slip are available to suit different needs  highway economy  towing  etc  Although the new truck is only available in light duty   147half ton 148 form  suitably configured it can carry up to 3 000 pounds or tow up to 9 500 The FX4 and Lariat come standard with a 40 20 40 bench like other F 150s  but as an option they offer buckets separated by a full center console that flows cleanly into the dash and mounts the shifter  a first in this class   Even the performance oriented Chevy Silverado SS has a column mounted shifter  This option is less practical  but to a car guy like myself it takes full size pickups in a whole new direction Although every possible combination of the above is not available  the range of variants is staggering and will only become more so in later years as additional powertrains are added Further complicating matters this year  the old F 150 will continue to be sold alongside the new one  Ford did this the last time the truck was redesigned  for the 1996 model year  At least this time around the aesthetic jump is not as drastic I 146m not going off road  so the faux wood trimmed  city slicker Lariat probably best fits how I would use such a vehicle  But I prefer the rugged yet sophisticated styling of the FX4  I also felt that the SuperCab with 6 5 foot standard bed represented the optimal combination of functionality and maneuverability   I suspect this configuration will be most popular with non commercial buyers  The SuperCrew is available only with the shortest bed  and the 8 foot bed is available only on the XL and XLT and makes for one ungainly 248 inch long truck when paired with the SuperCab  At 230 inches  the SuperCab with 6 5 bed is already a lot of vehicle  As luck would have it  the only F 150 I could find to drive was this configuration   Even this one might have been pre sold 151one salesman thought so  but the other was willfully ignorant of its status   Styling  The F 150 146s styling has been updated much like the Explorer 146s was for 2002 and the Expedition 146s was for 2003  Almost too prissy for a truck curves have given way to a more formal  more massive  broader shouldered look  Unlike the last time around  the new truck is not clearly a step ahead of the old one  it 146s just different  The new sheetmetal is much less striking than the   a href content 113078275716 Dodge Ram s a b   click for my review  and even less distinctive than the aero influenced old truck 146s  but to my eye it is the most refined and handsome among large pickups  It is hard to imagine it ever looking old or dated  already the fate of GM 146s current pickups  Like on Ford 146s heavy duty pickups the front side window dips down to lend the styling one brand specific detail and perhaps permit the large side mirrors to be mounted a bit lower  The largest wheels are 18s  and though no match for the cartoonish 20s available on the Ram they further enhance the truck 146s bold stance While the exterior styling is clearly evolutionary  the interior is revolutionary  I 146ve already mentioned the available full center console  In comparison  the center console in GM 146s trucks  clumsily integrated with the instrument panel  looks even more pathetic than it already did  The tall  cylindrical  chrome trimmed shift lever might be a bit too space age  and it could feel smoother  but it catches the eye and demonstrates the extent of Ford 146s desire to reinvent the pickup cabin  The click  square edged styling of the leather trimmed buckets looks very upscale  The pebbled texture of the FX4 146s black  147sport 148 leather further connotes this is one tough yet ritzy truck   Want leather in something other than black  Tan leather is available only in the Lariat  Although the XL and STX share a non tach instrument cluster  the other three trim lines have six gauge clusters that not only differ in graphics  cream faces in the Lariat  for example  but in the location of the gauges  Varying the latter can be costly  and I don 146t see the point  Some subtle differences in preferences might be involved  but I imagine any of the three gauge layouts would have been fine with pretty much everyone  So perhaps they tried too hard  and have added unnecessary cost as a result Aside from these interior features  what most impresses is the level of fit and finish in the interior  The materials might not be suitable for a Lexus  but they 146re nicer than any other Ford I 146ve been in  Fits and seams appear very precise  which is rarer than it should be in domestic vehicles  After test driving this truck and wondering why Ford doesn 146t outfit its cars this well I read a review  in  Automobile   that ventured the same question  Between the styling and the materials  the new F 150 146s interior shames those in other domestic pickups b Accommodations  The front buckets first impress with their size  They feel like thrones  Then there is the matter of design  The comparison between them and the front seats in the competition resembles that between modern furniture and a traditional American sofa  Okay  maybe not quite that large a difference  but it 146s getting there  These seats are considerably firmer than the pickup norm  such that you sit on them rather than in them  They possess side bolsters  but these are too widely spaced to serve any function for all but the widest people  I found these seats comfortable  but traditional pickup buyers might find them somehow foreign As expected in such a vehicle  visibility forward and to the sides is excellent  To the rear it 146s not so good owing to the tall  distant rear end  I would highly recommend the optional reverse sensing system  I don 146t see the point of such systems in most cars  but here I see the point  The truck I drove lacked this option  but based on similar systems in other vehicles I 146ve driven it should work well The driving position is the most carlike of the domestic trucks  The Chevrolet is similar  while the Dodge seat is mounted so high I found myself planting my left foot flat on the floor 151no need for a dead pedal  In the Ford you could almost be in a car  if one with large seats positioned well above the ground  In the Dodge you 146re clearly in a truck Given the truck 146s height off the ground  the optional tubular steps were a great help getting in and out  The Chevrolet and Dodge trucks I drove lacked such steps  though they are available either from the factory or aftermarket  and getting in and out was much harder  especially with the latter   The Chevrolet 146s seating position is the lowest of the three  Especially if you are short or have kids  you 146re going to want some form of step with any of these trucks When Chevrolet introduced fully redesigned pickups five years ago they eclipsed the competition in rear seat comfort  for the first time offering a rear seat in an extended cab with enough knee room and enough angle to the backrest to seat adults in adequate comfort  Well  the GM product is now the granddaddy of the bunch  When Dodge introduced its new truck last year  it offered an even roomier rear seat  Now it 146s Ford 146s turn to offer the best of the bunch  Unlike Ford and Chevrolet  Dodge offers only a single extended cab model with four conventional doors  Although the Ford SuperCab still uses rear hinged half doors  it contains a roomier  more comfortable rear seat than the Dodge  The SuperCrew rear seat offers another six inches of rear legroom  but unless the front seats will be most of the way back  i e  for tall people up front  the SuperCab 146s rear seat provides enough room for medium sized adults  and more than enough for children The SuperCab 146s rear doors might be rear hinged  but unlike before  and still in the GM products  they contain windows that fully retract rather than just pop out  One major innovation was missed  however  I 146ve been told that rear hinged doors can be difficult to use in parking lots  as you end up with insufficient room to move about alongside the vehicle when parked next to another vehicle with both doors open  Nissan 146s upcoming large pickup solves this problem with a rear hinged door that opens 180 degrees  The Ford 146s just opens about 90  Could be an argument for the SuperCrew 133 An optional power sliding rear window is another first with this truck  No power folding rear seat  yet  though As in all large pickups beginning with the 1993 Dodge Ram  cargo compartments within the cabin are generously sized  Ford offers an innovative track system that fits various accessories as well as storage on the ceiling  but this was replaced in the truck I drove by an optional sunroof  Yes  a sunroof in a large pickup  They must really be targeting people used to cars 133 Even regular cabs have small rear hinged doors to provide better access to an enlarged internal cargo area Unlike the Chevrolet but like the Dodge the SuperCab 146s folding rear seat is split 60 40  Unlike the Dodge  there are no nifty storage compartments beneath it  but this frees up a big more volume The new pickup beds are a couple of inches deeper than the norm  To my eye this significantly enhances their cargo volume  However  one review I 146ve read suggested this together with the Ford 146s height  GM products sit a bit lower  makes it hard to reach into the bed and grab stuff  Unfortunately  I did not check this out  but will the next time I have the chance  An innovative torsion bar makes the tailgate easier to open and close than other pickups b On the Road  The styling and interior comfort of the new F 150 suggest a better driving truck  Is this accurate The FX4 comes standard with the three valve  5 4 liter V8  In comparison  the GM 5 3 liter produces five fewer horsepower and 35 fewer foot pounds of torque  The latter seems an especially significant difference  The touted  147Hemi 148 5 7 liter in the Dodge kicks out 45 more horses  but only ten more units of torque 151so in the midrange the two engines aren 146t far apart  The Dodge also has another gear ratio to play with  How does all of this shake out  Well  even though I tested the GM engine in the Avalanche  which is heavier than the Silverado  it felt the perkiest of the three in normal despite having the weakest stats  Both the Ford and the Dodge have to be prodded more to get them to perk up  At full throttle the Dodge might well have the edge  but based on the seat of my pants the difference is too close to call  I suspect differences in mass counterbalance those in power  The truck I drove weighed about 5 700 pounds   Glass sunroofs  step bars  the FX4 146s standard skid plates  the stiffer longer frame 133such features can add serious mass  In comparison  a base GM 4WD extended cab truck weighs under 5000 pounds  though the 4WD Avalanche clocks in around 5 700  The Dodge falls between the two I also drove the Chevrolet Silverado in 345 horse SS form  It 146s quicker Bottom line  Even with the revised 5 4 and optional 3 73 axle the Ford is hardly quick  I especially expected more passing power on the highway  What the Ford V8 is is quieter and smoother than the others  The Chevrolet produces considerably more intake roar with little provocation  while the Dodge 146s Hemi produced so much mechanical noise at idle that I almost thought the salesman had grabbed the keys to a Cummins diesel by mistake   The Hemi engine will later be available in Chrysler 146s large cars  that should be interesting given its very trucky character EPA ratings are 14 18 with four wheel drive  15 19 with rear wheel drive  similar to GM 146s 15 18 and one mile per gallon better than Dodge 146s 13 17  However  word of mouth suggests that real world fuel economy is best with the GM trucks  People I know with GM trucks typically report fuel economy in the 14 15 range  those with Fords in the 11 12 range  or worse  I suspect the additional weight of the Ford trucks  which forces their engines to work harder  is to blame  Ford claims major frame and suspension improvements for better ride and handling  The frame is nine times stiffer than the old one  while the cabs are twice as stiff  The rear springs are wider  while the shocks are mounted outside the frame  The steering is rack and pinion  a first for four wheel drive trucks   The Dodge uses rack and pinion with the rear drive chassis only  But how does it all pan out In character the new F 150 resembles the current Expedition  body motions feel more precisely and tightly controlled than in the competition  and the steering is firmer and also more precise  Lean in turns feels more restrained than in the others  especially the non SS GM products   147Taut 148 comes to mind  That said  the GM products handle more responsively and intuitively  They feel somehow more natural despite their overboosted  less precise steering  The Ford in comparison feels technically superior but distant Another downside the large Fords share  a faintly jiggly ride over minor pavement imperfections   147Taut 148 has a price  Granted  I drove the F 150 in FX4 form  which includes a stiff  off road ready suspension  But the Expedition feels much the same  and the current Explorer does as well  so I suspect this jiggle is inherent in Ford 146s suspension philosophy  Throwing some mass in the back might help  I 146ve long noted in  Consumer Reports  that  unlike most cars  Ford 146s cars often ride better when heavily loaded  If this is true for the cars  it must also be true for the trucks  which are designed to carry loads  In short  Ford 146s suspension philosophy might include optimizing the ride with the vehicle heavily loaded Noise of all forms is unexpectedly low in the new Ford  This is the common finding from my test drive  refinement  refinement  refinement  Did the Blackwood come a generation too soon I did not evaluate off road performance  given that this was a test drive  I lack the skills at any rate  I would be surprised if the new FX4 did not perform well off the pavement  though  One nifty feature  the electronic throttle is more progressive in 4 low b Safety  Like the GM trucks but unlike the Dodge  four wheel anti lock brakes are standard  On the other hand  side airbags  of the curtain variety  are only available in the Dodge  Traction control and stability control are not yet available on any of these four wheel drive trucks b Reliability  First year designs from Detroit brands are often troublesome  Will the new F 150 prove unreliable  On the one hand  if Ford could get any product right straight out of the box it would be this one  as they no doubt threw scads of their top talent at this truck  The engines and transmissions are also largely carryover  with the exception of the heavioy revised 5 4 liter V8  eliminating a common source of problems   The V6 in my second year Ford Contour required replacement at 66 000 miles because of an issue known within Ford but not admitted to by Ford dealers  On the other  this was a very complex program  and recent first year Fords  Focus  Escape  have been especially troublesome  I guess it all comes down to whether you are a betting man  If the truck does prove troublesome  I hope Ford dealers know more about this product than the Contour I recently disposed of  Even in the Detroit area I experienced much difficulty finding a dealer with a skilled and personable service department  I once asked a dozen Ford owners if they knew of a good Ford service department  and they all said no b Pricing  As you might have noticed  I drove a truck with most of the available options  They add up  The sticker on my truck  which still lacked a few minor options  and the pricey Flareside bed  read  37 770  Go with the SuperCrew and check every box  and the sticker will easily top forty  Edmunds suggests dealers will discount the truck I drove to  35 000  Currently no rebate is available  though low interest financing is Since many features on this truck are not even available on the competition  to get a sense of relative pricing it is better to look at an SuperCab XLT 4WD with the 5 4 liter engine  automatic  electronic 4WD  limited slip differential  rear defroster  power driver 146s seat  alloy wheels  and towing package  I expect this will be a popular combination  This truck would list for  33 105  and  30 700 after the typical discount   Note  Doing without four wheel drive would cut the price by over  3 000 A similarly equipped Chevrolet Silverado LS extended cab with 5 4 liter V8 lists for  32 080 with a heavily discounted  147light duty power package 148  I suspect this package is intended to counteract Ford 146s new truck  After the typical discount and a  1 500 rebate  the cost drops to about  27 600  A similarly equipped   a href content 113078275716 Dodge Ram a b  1500 Quad Cab with 5 7 liter V8 lists for  34 500  The typical discount and a  1 000 rebate take this down to about  30 600  So about dead even with the Ford The Chevrolet is the oldest truck here  and GM has priced it to compensate  the other two are  3 000 more  quite a difference  I see lower transaction prices from Ford and Dodge in the future  but in the case of the former perhaps only after it stops selling the old F 150 in 2005  Until then  the old truck can be used to keep price sensitive buyers from defecting to GM i Update i  I ran the above numbers assuming that the Ford s electronic four wheel drive system  optional on XLT  standard on 4WD FX4 and Lariat  is a ful time system  as the salesman claimed as much  But I see no such claim in the brochure  and  Consumer Guide  states that Ford offers only a part time system in the F 150  If so  then I have overstated the price of the Chevrolet and Dodge by about  400  The new Ford just seems pricier and pricier b Last Words  The new Ford F 150 impresses with its style  fit and finish  and all around refinement  I cannot recall ever finding a standard full size pickup so appealing  The truck s major weakness is too much poundage even for its new  stronger engine  Overall  the new pickup shows what Ford can do when it pours talent and money into the development of a vehicle  But can the new F 150 recoup its large investment and relatively high manufacturing costs  Can it bring good times back to Dearborn  That remains to be seen  The Chevrolet and especially the Dodge seem very trucky after a drive in the Ford  But the new Ford is priced far above the Chevrolet  and I 146m unsure how many people will be willing to pay the premium  A few months will tell
