 First of all  I live by myself in a dorm in downtown Austin  There is little or no parking available where I live  and most of the places I have to get to are within walking distance  Also  I have a couple of friends that always seem to be willing to drive me around  Because of these reasons  I really have no need for a car I have owned a few  however  Actually  it was mostly partial ownership  as my parents technically bought them and just let me drive around in them  I ve used these cars enough to form an adequate review  I believe  and that is what I intend to do right now The Ford Mustang has always been a great looking car with relatively decent gas mileage  about the same if not better than previous 4 cylinder cars I have used  In particular  I love the  94 model s style when compared to the earlier and newest models  This body style will be a classic  for sure  Passenger wise  it is a great single or two person road trip vehicle  In the three years that I had access to it  it proved itself to be very dependable and still ran great  in spite of having 70 000 miles on it  when we traded it in  I did not consider myself then  nor do I consider myself now a car aficionado by any means  but this was one of my favorites of the cars that I drove  My complaints are minimal  I don t like to drive fast  so the fact that it s 3 8L engine doesn t have the sound or power of other cars didn t affect me much  although my  quot friends quot  made quite a joke out of it  It can still beat most cars off the line with a 5 speed manual  but drops into the backfield rather quickly  Another thing I noticed is that bugs tend to take off too much paint on the hood and front bumper  not to mention the pealing and chipping of the paint right behind the wheel wells  Mud flaps would dramatically fix this problem  The body dents very easily  which can be very costly to repair  The interior is not the quietest place I ve encountered  and the rattling and squeaking noises can be an annoyance  As the car approached the 70 000 mile mark  I began to get a little concerned about the rumors drifting around about head gasket problems on this model  But my fears were unfounded  the inspector didn t even find any minor gasket problems when we turned it in This car was bought for around  10 000 and it is certainly worth the money  as far as I am concerned  It may not be the fastest car on the road  but I loved this car and would recommend it to anyone who asks br br
