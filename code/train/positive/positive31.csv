 A few months ago my wife and I went car shopping  We went looking for a Tracker  A really good car when we have a car seat  and a 2 year old LOL  Well that day we test drove about 10 cars  Just as we thought our search was going no where I saw the Escort sitting right by the Tracker we tried 1st  We test drove the car and loved the way it drove  A lot better car for a growing family than a Tracker  I have to say I never saw me owning a station wagon  but I will not trade it in now  Being an Escort the gas mileage is great  We get about 30 mile to the gallon and with todays prices you can not beat that The one thing I worried about was the leg room  Being 6 5 quot  it is hard to find a good car with leg room  To my surprise the wagon is very roomy  Well as long as no one has to sit behind me  So I have to say I really do like my new car  even though it is an 1993  Does this mean I am getting old  LOL
