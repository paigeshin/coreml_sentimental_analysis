 I purchased my 1995 Ford Explorer  Eddie Bauer Edition new  it was a dealer demo  in 1995 after shopping and comparing nearly every competing SUV The Explorer was the most comfortable of all comparable SUV s at that time  and five years later has lost very little of its comfort for driver or passengers  The notable comfort deterioration that has occurred is in various electrical system failures  Neither the dealer nor Ford has taken an acceptable level of responsibility for repairing electrical defects  Although the sound system has been repaired 5 times at no cost  other failures such as heat AC fan speed adjustability and wiper timing adjustability were not warranted The Explorer has provided 100  reliable transportation  having never required any functional service other than for normal maintenance  It handles like a smaller car in many ways  including cornering  It does burn a lot of gas  averaging about 14 miles per gallon with a mix of city and highway driving The Explorer is not designed for hauling large loads  but can fit a surprising amount of bulk if necessary  It is well suited for family trips Overall this was an expensive car to purchase  is expensive to fuel  and at a nuisance level has been expensive to keep functioning electrically  It has served its purpose quite well for me  My primary consideration was comfort for driver and all passengers  with transportation reliability being a high priority as well br br
