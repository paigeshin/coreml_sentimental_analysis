 I have owned my Taurus for 3 years and I put about 60 000 miles on it in those 3 years  I have been very happy with the car in all aspects except road noise  The weatherstripping on the windows seems to make a lot of noise  If you play the radio at average volume you don t seem to hear it  but when the radio isn t on  it seems kind of loud  The ride is great  both front and back seats  You can easily sleep in the back seat on road trips  There is plenty of room for the family up front  and the luggage in the trunk  The acceleration is also very good for a  quot family quot  car  as you can make passes safely  Common repairs are average in cost  brakes tires oil changes  But I have priced some other parts that seemed a little high  rotors 100  alternator 200  these seem about double what the average part might cost  Fortunately I haven t had to replace these parts  but it is something to keep in mind when buying this type of car Overall the 1995 Taurus is a great family with pretty much everything I have expected from this car  If they would fix the road noise it could be almost perfect br br
