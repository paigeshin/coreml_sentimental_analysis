 I have been looking for many years for a truck that will stand out from all others  I have found it  Ford has made many models and sold millions  I went to the Ford Dealership where I live and I was shopping for a truck and as I walked into the show room there it was  This truck was the big foot of all  Custom style with all the extra  This truck was made to stay in the showroom and their was not one other was like this one  I then looked it over and it had all I wanted and I was sold  I test driven  and I was surprised that this truck was made for me  I seen trucks of the same model on the lot and this one was made special  Large tires with mag s  California Concept detailing  I said to the sale man  I ll take it  There was group of people there wanting to take this truck out of the showroom and was told its sold  If I would of walked away and went on looking elsewhere it would of been gone  People come up to me and ask where did you get your truck  Its one of a kind custom made  Rear Cab is custom with closure of the body color and lock  Not with cab liner as most truck  This make more safe when traveling and packing all your extra in the rear  California Concept is a company that specializing in detailing with all the extra as tires and shields and medal steps side for that sporty look  If you go and look for a truck of this kind ask the dealership for information about California Concept  and then you will have a truck you will love
