  This opinion comes from a girl with no experience with trucks of any kind except maybe the toy trucks I buy my son  This is strictly a review on why I like it  not on anything under the hood i My boyfriend loves trucks  I had never driven a standard before  Since we both use the vehicle I thought buying a truck wasn t a smart idea  He said I needed to learn  He earns the money  I was out voted We just bought our Ranger last week  It was only  600 00  definitely in our budget  I must say that I am pleased  The truck is great on gas which is a major plus with the gas prices rising and falling everyday  Although  it isn t a full sized truck  it can carry a load a lot bigger than you would think it could  The cab isn t very roomy but it gives me and my boyfriend some  quot close quot  time lol I learned how to drive it in a day which surprised me because I m not very coordinated when it comes to doing more than one thing at a time  and no it s not because I m blonde  It was very easy to learn on  The truck is still in great running condition for being 10 years old and having over 100 000 miles on it  It s not too big either which is great for me so I don t try to run people over if they get in my way I was very pleased with our purchase and would recommend a Ford Ranger for anyone in the market for a cheap  dependable little truck  It s a great one for us women drivers br br
