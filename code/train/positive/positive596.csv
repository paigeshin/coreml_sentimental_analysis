 My husband loves Jaguars  He has a current lease on an S type  has been to tour their factories in England  and has numerable collectables and trinkets adorning our home  tantamount to his love of this legendary car  So why am I writing about a Ford Escape  Because it took a will and determination equal to his passion to convince him NOT to renew his lease on another Jaguar  OK  all you fellow jag nuts can come assassinate me now  but at least hear me out first  Our S type was riddled with problems  and has had no less than THREE major  147hospital 148 visits in the two years it has lived with us  and this does not count the time I had a teeny tiny little scrape up  and had to have the rear bumper replaced 133oops  Nor does this count the numerous times we had to take it in for minor repairs  I wont go into detail of our woes now  that will be for another review  but suffice it to say  I was ready for something with a little more reliability  So  we set off on a quest for a car that fit our bill of needs  sporty  stylish  a luxurious feel  and  not at all in the least  coverage by Ford 146s A plan  aah  yes  the limiting factor  And so we ended up at the Ford Escape b The Car  My new Escape is a brand new 2003  4WD Limited model  with BOTH available options of the power moonroof and the trailer towing package  This model Escape comes complete with a 4 liter  V6 engine  I chose the silver color  more on my husband 146s insistance than anything else  I would have preferred black  for a sleeker look  The interior is black leather b Appearance  I  Outside   The Escape is not an ugly small SUV  but its overall outward appearance is rather boxy by my standards  This is compounded by the lack of plastic  147fenders 148 on the Limited model  which are a distinguishing identifier of the XLT and XLS models  Apparantly Ford thinks that a monotone body looks more stylish and  147upperclass 148  but I think the black edging gives the bottom of the car a finished look  I don 146t know how this will translate into long term preservation of the car 146s finish  but I expect the bottom of the car may show more dings and scratches  and be more prone to rust  In addition  all Escapes have a rather high  square  hind end  This adds to the boxy appearance  but does mean more storage space in the cargo area  so it is an equitable trade off    Inside   The inside of the Limited Escape has a much more luxurious feel than the outside  It feels quite roomy  and the front passenger seating area seems to have as much space as the larger Explorer  The black leather seats are quite nice  both looks wise and in comfort  The simulated leather trim on the dash  however  does not uphold the luxury car appearance  It is too grainy  and puckered in some places  I don 146t know what would have worked better  since real leather or wood probably would have put the car outside of its price class  perhaps a simulated wood could have done the trick  The driver controls panel is somewhat stylish by day  the round  white windows look rather futuristic  but the effect is ruined at night  Rather than continuing to glow their opalescent white  they turn black  with illuminated dials and numbers in the oh so christmasy green and red  Personally  I think the white  147glow bug 148 look is much nicer  and some neon blue dials would have completed the look nicely  The  piece de resistance   of the dash area is the silver temperature audio console  It contrasts nicely with the black surface covering  and greatly adds to the  147luxury 148 feel of the car  This takes up most of the middle area of the front dash  and is complete with 6 CD in dash changer  tuner  air temperature controls and vents  and storage pockets  some of which seem more useful than others The backseat and cargo areas are also quite nice  The pockets on the back of the front seats look to be quite useful for children 146s accessories  and the rear seat headrests are a nice  and not often seen feature  The cargo area is roomy  with plenty of headspace for tall objects  There is also a stylish roll up style cover  which can be pulled over low lying objects for privacy  This can be rolled up when not in use  and even removed entirely The entire interior has a uniform feel  with its black leather seating and dash surfaces  and black plush carpeting covering the floors  mats  cargo area  and front face of rear seats  and the tinted windows and moonroof complete the mood lit effect of being in a dark car b Functionality  I Comfort  Sitting in this car is quite nice  the driver seat is fully adjustable in so many ways it would be hard not to find a good fit  One thing I don 146t understand is why there are no power controls on the passenger side seat  and why the power controls don 146t extend to the lumbar support and seat tilt on the driver side  Really  if you 146re going to go power  please just go all the way  However  all power controls are close at hand  including those to the windows and moonroof  and one touch butt warmers  so nice  and this ease of use extends to the space age silver temp audio console  Everything is within reach and self explanatory  no muddling about with buttons trying to figure out what does which  One control which is not in the best location is the all too important GEAR SHIFT  Come on guys  Why make the gear shift handle block the view of the gear shift indicator  Being a new car  I don 146t yet have a good feel of where drive  neutral  etc  are  and it is quite disconcerting to have to move my head around to see what gear I have shifted too  I am sure this is something that will come to bother me less in time  as I develop a feel for the car  but right now it is an irritating testament to Ford quality  or not  The backseat is also quite roomy and comfortable  even for a full size adult  which I am not  measuring in at a mere 5 ft tall  but even my husband had room to move his feet around  This comfort tested out for both the side and middle seats  so there should be minimal fussing over which child goes where  As far as storage areas go  this car offers plenty  The glove box and armrest console are quite roomy  and there is some storage built in for CD cases  There are 2 potentially useful bins underneath the audio console  one with an extra power jack  and 2 good sized cupholders  one of which holds a removable ashtray  This would give you room for a cell phone  sunglasses  and some change  but looks prone to collecting semi useless junk that wont quite stay in place  One nice feature is the press able garage door opener holder that sits above the rear view mirror  The rear cargo area  as stated before  also seems quite useful  and the rear seats fold down to allow for oversized objects I Practicality   Well  the guts of this review should be how well this car works and drives  and here it is  although I can 146t promise this will show off my reviewing ability to its finest  I am not a car connoisseur  and I know little about the mechanical innards that make them go  I am writing this from the point of view of your average driver  not an expert on the subject by any means  Well  with the disclaimer in place  here goes  I am a truck driver by nature  having graduated to my Escape from a Ford Ranger Splash  and I was unsure of how I would like the  147car chassy 148 feel of the Escape  Well  I like it  I can 146t say that it drives like my truck  but it does have a similar feel  including the better visibility that comes with the extra height  The car has a nice amount of pick up  but it does take some time to switch gears  about 2 seconds after I think it should have  which can be slightly disconcerting  Once going  the car cruises along quite happily  without any feel of a struggle  I have read in some reviews that there is excessive wind noise  however I did not find this to be the case  Perhaps it is because I am used to trucks  which tend to be louder than cars  The car has some nice driving features  my favorite of which is the 4WD  I am used to the 3 option 4WD    off  low  or high  with appropriate measures needed to switch from one to the other  This little truck has a nice  147auto 148 feature  which enables the car to switch power to whichever wheel needs it most  This essentially allows you to have 4WD on all the time  without the excess fuel consumption  There is  of course  also the option of putting it in full time 4WD  presumably better for snowy or slippery conditions  Overall  the car feels quite stable  I always feel like it is  in control  with no fear of swaying or tipping  It feels like a quality ride b Synposis  I am quite happy with my new little Escape  I will gingerly classify it as a  147luxury 148 SUV  because in the Limited model  it has the finest equipment one could want in a utility vehicle  It has a nice upscale feel to it  and it drives quite nicely  forming a near perfect hybrid of car and truck  I think it makes a nice alternative to both the unimaginative mini van and the fuel guzzling true trucks or SUV  It may just make a perfect match for someone who needs extra space for children and accompanying accessories  but who does not want to give up owning a luxury car b POST NOTE b While this review is on a 2003 Escape  for some reason Epinions did not offer 2003 as an option in the  model year  drop down window  Fear not  it is not a review of a 2002 car
