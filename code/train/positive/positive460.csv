 Well maybe not PERFECT for cruising for chicks  but that may be better  since I ll have my two kids in the back seat  But seriously  the Ford Expedition is an all around great time We bought the Expedition because we wanted something to accommodate our 4 member family  the car seats  shopping bags  toys  games and the occasional grandparent  The Expedition fits them all in nicely  no problem  and often all at the same time Roomy  glamorous  stylish and comfortable  the Ford Expedition is an S U V of many faces  Wash it up  wax it down  put on your Sunday best and you can show up at the most elegant of gatherings next to Ferraris and Bentleys and no one would look twice  Throw your bikes in the back  the kids in the car seats  cruise to McD s for a happy meal and you ll fit right in  It is the only car I know of with multiple personality disorder  it doesn t know what the hell it is The Expedition drives with almost no effort whatsoever  it practically drives itself  You can steer with one finger if you like living on the edge  and the braking is no problem for even the smallest of parents  Headroom and legroom are topnotch  I should know  being 6 9 quot  I don t fit into many cars  but the Ford Expedition was made just for me The one drawback is the price of gas  and with a fuel slurping V 8  expect many trips to the pump  But with all the room  stylish look and comfort the Ford Expedition hands out  I won t be complaining about gas for too long  and neither will you We own the Black Eddie Bauer version with the tan leather interior  and it is elegance all the way home  The sounds system pumps  the passing power is awesome  and the drive is smooth as silk If you have the need  head over to you Ford dealer and take a test drive  you might just pay the dealer from the driver s seat and never get out br br
