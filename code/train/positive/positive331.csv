 This is a nice little car but when i say little i mean it  You could not fit four good sized guys in this cars it would come apart at the seems  The only other downfall is that is has aluminum heads on it and if you overheat the car once you will most likely crack the heads  But other then that it is not a bad little car if you are looking for a beater to get back and forth to work  And they get great gas mileage about 30 miles to the gallon  I would recommend this car to anyone that is looking of cheap transportation
