 My husband owns a 1998 Ford Escort ZX2  He loves his little car  He always talks about it and talks of how people compliment him on the look of the car  At first we bought this car because of the low price  As we began to drive it more often we decided we liked it better than cars we ve owned in the past  The things I love about this car is the quick acceleration and sporty look  The gas mileage is good for a sports car  We usually get around 35 city 45 highway  The downfalls are the lack of head room and the loud running engine  It is nice to drive this vehicle around town because of how fast it will get up and go  It is easy to pass slow drivers and make that yellow light  I think this car would be best for the teenagers  Thanks
