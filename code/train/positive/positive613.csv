 I bought the car because my dad bought the first escort back in 84 and i wanted to be like dad  I waited till there was an escort worthy of a by from me and I m not just bragging because I own one  it is one of the most reliable cars on the market I didn t just go out and buy it because it was a ford and I looked at the market and it really was the best in power and in gas mileage and in over all performance I would give this car an 11 out of 10 on looks and handing  well as for theft protecting i does have some flaws there mine was stolen twice from me in the state of Tennessee and i was lucky to be able to say I have the car in my hands once more  mine is green in color and use to have five spoke 14 quot  rims but i have to replace them all I would recommend for every one to get steel rims for your escort br br
