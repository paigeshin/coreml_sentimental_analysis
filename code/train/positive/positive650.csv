 I bought my 1990 Ford Probe LX  3 0L V6  about 4 years ago  Since then I ve had to replace the brakes  front rotors  the radiator and a few radiator hoses  a power steering hose  and the rear wiper motor  Also  it is in need of some new injectors  It now has 125k miles  These are all expected normal wear and tear items  The motor and transmission have been ROCK SOLID  The 3 0L is a really tough motor no wonder it is in just about all the other Fords  Ranger  Taurus Sable  Aerostar Windstar  Tempo Topaz  and the Mazda pickups  The Manual transmission is very strong and it shifts very smoothly and is the perfect match to the 3 0L V6 motor  Handling on snow and ice are pretty good if you are careful   studded or all season tires help tremendously  I basically have no problems dropping a gear and passing people if I have to  There is PLENTY of trunk space under the hatch and good space up front  however typical of a car like this the rear seats are fairly cramped  The perspective from the drivers seat is excellent  You can raise or lower your seat with the automatic controls on the side as well to help with visibility and comfort  I really like being able to see the hood when I drive as well as the pop up headlights  good for aiming the car down the road All of the power options are nice  Power windows  power steering  power seats  power mirrors  power antenna  etc  Anti lock brakes come in handy on ice believe me  I KNOW living in Alaska  For you gear heads into modifying cars the 3 0 seems to be very responsive  I installed a cat back exhaust w high flow muffler  and a K N Filter  The thing growls and rumbles alot like a V8  Suprises alot of Honda and other 4 cyl owners out there  Cars that I owned previous to this one  1985 Ford Escort  1987 Toyota Celica GT  1991 Toyota Celica GT S  1991 Nissan 240SX  1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS
