 If you re in the market for a heavy duty pick up  I d like to offer you some suggestions  I have two Ford F350 Super Duties and have driven the Dodge Ram 2500  Based on my experience with these vehicles and others  here s what I think would be the ultimate truck It should be an extended cab  four door  long bed  diesel powered   manually shifted  3 4 ton    four wheel drive truck with shift on the fly  auto locking hubs  limited slip differential  four wheel anti lock disc brakes and powered drivers seat in a medium trim level  Here s why Extended cab   gives you comfortable seating for up to six adults  additional cab storage and is still maneuverable  When you go to the full crew cab   long bed version you loose big on maneuverability  70 80 ft  turning radius  and don t gain that much in seating and interior storage  If you are a contractor ferrying crews and equipment from job to job that s a different story Four doors   this is just a matter of convenience  Having had them I can t imagine an extended cab truck without them  Long bed   if you re buying a truck to haul cargo you ll want the 8 ft  bed  You ll never complain about the bed being too long  but if you go with the short bed  sooner or later you re there will be something that you can t haul  Another reason for the long bed is improved ride   the extra 18  or so of additional wheelbase length makes a big difference limousine effect Diesel powered   being underpowered is the last thing you want in a heavy duty truck  You put yourself and other motorists at risk if you can t keep up with the normal flow of traffic  Today s modern turbo charged  inner cooled  waste gated diesel engines are powerful  reliable  long lasting and efficient  You ll recoup most of your 4 or 5 grand initial investment at trade in  In the meantime  you ll be getting superior mileage and more raw torque than any available gas engine  and a 100 000 mile warranty to boot Manually shifted   for better control in adverse driving conditions  The auto shifters I ve driven have a time lag   especially when starting from a dead stop   when you push down on the accelerator before you start moving that is annoying and possibly unsafe  This lull protects the transmission from torque overload but also degrades drivability 3 4 ton   has a much smoother ride and has no effect on trailer towing ability versus a 1 ton truck  Again  if you re a contractor hauling heavy loads on the truck itself   go with the 1 ton Four wheel drive   versatility  go most anywhere and do most anything    a must have for mud or snow Shift on the fly   can t imagine having to stop in order to shift into four wheel drive  If you re in deep dodo you want to keep your momentum Auto locking hubs   you don t want to get out of the truck to engage the front hubs  see deep dodo above Limited slip differential   there s way to much power with the diesel motor to only drive one rear tire  In my opinion this is an absolute must Four wheel anti lock disc brakes   another absolute must  There s just no sense in not being able to stop your truck safely and controllably Powered drivers seat   enables a comfortable and safe driving position for various drivers  Shorter drivers especially will want this feature Medium trim level   you get a lot of convenience and appearance options for a small price  and increases resale value I hope this will be of help if you re considering purchasing one of these trucks  They are a considerable investment that you can t exchange once you drive it off the lot  Well  that s my epinion of the ultimate heavy duty truck  Why did I put it under the Ford F250 Super Duty category  Because  I think this vehicle   equipped as described above   is as close as you can come to the ideal truck br br
