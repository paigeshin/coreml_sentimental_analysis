 I have a  99 4WD extended cab XLT with the gas V 10 engine  I have plenty of power to haul a 2700 pound camper I blow by those Dodge diesels chugging up the Rockies every day with this engine  I get up to 13 MPG without a load and down to 9 MPG loaded on mountain roads with the automatic  This is my first automatic and I must say it is very smooth  In 30 000 miles I ve had no problems and have visited the shop only for fluid changes and several recall notices  I have added extra overload springs as I felt the single factory springs that came with the camper package was not enough for the size camper I have on it  I would consider putting on larger tires when running at maximum gross vehicle weight like I do  although the stock aluminum rims with General tires still have about half the tread at 30M With the automatic and the on the fly 4WD switch I have even more room up front with nothing cluttering the floor  I d recommend the optional electric camper mirrors  This truck is a tight and smooth runner
