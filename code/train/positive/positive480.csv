 The Ford Focus caught my eye  but not my pocketbook for over a year  I believed that they were little boxes and felt as if I would be better off buying something different  Boy was I wrong  I have a 2000 Toyota ECHO and have recently purchased a 2001 Focus  The focus seems much more stable  has better pick up and hopefully will not be as much trouble as the Echo has been  The interior is very comfortable and the air conditioner is very cold  Even sitting in the back seat  between two car seats  I stayed very cool  We own a hatchback  The  trunk space  is not overly large  but it is adequate  I just wouldn t take it on a long trip with all the kid s stuff  The gas mileage is great  Average mileage is 35 per gallon  I would suggest this car to anyone looking for a new vehicle
