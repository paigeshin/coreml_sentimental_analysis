 I recently purchased the Ford Explorer and quite honestly have never been more satisfied with a vehicle purchase as I am with my Explorer  Upon my test drive of the Explorer I noticed a very highly detailed interior which is both driver friendly and easily navigated  I was very pleased the with the power in take off as well as the vehicles ability to pick up speed once already moving  The seats are comfortable and adjust easily  One concern would be the history of the manufacturers past failures  but to this point I am thoroughly satisfied  The capability of this vehicle to corner is also very surprising SUV s are known to be dangerous in higher speed maneuvering but the Explorer and Ford has seemed to located and lock in on the center of gravity for this vehicle  This is definitely the SUV all families or truck van enthusiasts should consider when shopping for a vehicle br br
