 This cobra is the second of this particular breed that I ve owned  the first being a 2001 Cobra Convertible  My initial reaction when I saw the reveal of this car is wow  The statistics alone are mind boggling  for any car  390 Horsepower  underrated by Ford intentionally  realistic figures are somewhere around 381 at the rear wheels and 415 25 at the flywheel  390 foot pounds of torque  0 60 in 4 5 seconds  1 4 mile time between 12 5 and 12 9  all OUT OF THE BOX  Finally  an auto maker took the drawing board out of the engineering room in the basement and took it out the enthusiasts that are actually buying and driving the car and said  OK guys  what should we do next  From the beginning  you go in knowing that you re getting a frighteningly fast car  but the deal just keeps getting better  As you sit down inside the car  you noticed the snake badged two tone leather suede seats  the electroluminescent instrument cluster  Mach 460 6 disc in dash CD player  and the coveted 6 speed Tremec T 56 6 speed manual transmission  shared by the Cobra s arch nemesis the Dodge Viper  The front seats are VERY comfortable for a sports coupe  strongly bolstered  yet still supportive and soft  The driver s seat is power  with adjustments to the height  angle  pitch  side bolster  rear end bolster  lumbar support  etc  The backseat is small  as is to be expected in this breed of car  most cars that can compete from a performance standpoint don 146t even HAVE a backseat  so my theory is be glad I have one at all  Popping the hood of the vehicle reveals a beautifully trimmed 32 valve Dual OverHead Cam 4 6 litre  281 ci  American V8  A small metal plate will grab the eye of anyone looking at an SVT engine for the first time  as each engine is hand signed  engraved  by the two man team that built them  Mounted proudly atop the large American V8 is an Eaton Roots type supercharger  capable of 8 pounds of boost from the factory  The engine has been modified from its aluminum block cousin that was in the 1999 and 2001 cobra  The new engine block is cast iron  to increase strength for the added stress created by the supercharger  The compression ratio has also been reduced  again  to accommodate the forced induction  After the typical male rush of testosterone  not a sexist comment  have seen plenty of ladies sporting Cobras as well as gentlemen  I closed the hood and took a tour around the outside of the car to gauge it s styling  The hood has been modified from the previous hood  both to add room for the blower  and  with the addition of  finally  functional hood vents  to vent hot air from the engine compartment  The front fascia has been modified  with more open areas to allow cool air to pass into the engine compartment to facilitate better engine cooling and venting of the massive front disc brakes  Along side the vehicle  Ford has changed the rocker panel trim slightly  and the side scoops  unfortunately not functional  have been modified from the 1999 2001 run  The rear of the  03 is very different  with a much cleaner look than its predecessors  and it s own siblings in the Mustang corral  The spoiler is now more integrated into the body  reminiscent of the spoilers on the BMW M series cars  The tunnel like large tail pipes make themselves very visible  as does the Badging naming this Mustang the head of the SVT pack  Minor tweaks such as spoilers on the windshield wipers  making them functional up to a frightening 130 miles per hour  body color keyed break away mirrors  and the restyled fascia set this snake apart from the others in the SVT cobra den  Now that I had investigated all that I could about the car with it motionless  it was time to wake the beast up for a little stretching of the legs  Immediately upon ignition  the car makes its intentions known with that typical American V8 burble  turning every head within 300 feet  After playing with the shifter  I decided it was time to set out on this little adventure  As I pulled out into the highway  I noticed how mild mannered this  supercar  seemed to be as I drove it into afternoon traffic  This car could very easily be slated into a comparison with Clark Kent   Superman  With a light foot on the throttle  its not jerky or hard to control in the least  It was when I decided to put my foot into the floorboard that the car underwent a metamorphosis  The  Boost  needle went full tilt to 8 PSI  the tachometer started its screaming climb to 6500 RPMs  and I was firmly planted  goofy grin and all  to the back of my seat  WOW  As I shifted into second at about 6000 RPMs  the whole cataclysmic process repeated itself  Approaching 6300 RPMs this time  I noticed OH MY GOD  I am in second gear  going 73 miles an hour  in just a bit shy of 6 seconds  Deciding that I wanted to keep my privilege to drive   I was in a 55 zone  I backed off the accelerator and shifted into third  giving my internal organs a moment to catch up to my body  I got on the interstate and repeated the jet like acceleration  up to about 100MPH and back down  Ok  now I don t just THINK the car is fast  I KNOW it is  Lateral acceleration  however  is just one part of the equation that makes a great sports car  What goes up must come down  Once I made sure I was in the clear with cars around me  a firm stomp on the brakes brought the massive 13 inch front Brembo rotors to life and as expected  in true Cobra fashion  the car stopped on a dime and handed over 9 and 1 2 cents change  Ok  that 146s two parts of the equation passed with flying colors  it can accelerate like a tomahawk missile and stop like it had reverse thrusters but can it handle anything less inviting than Interstate 75  I took the car to the road that my house is off of  in rural Paulding County  Georgia  The road is a blast for a driving enthusiast  two 90 degree curves  and soft slopes that turn halfway down a hill  etc  I made one run at a normal pace just to get a feel for the car  The second run etched an image of the car driving around on tires lined with double sticky tape  This car is glued to the road  Pushing it near its limits will illicit a bit of a happy rear end in hard cornering  which is to be expected and is welcomed as long as the driver is as capable about handling it as the car is doing it  The handling is brilliant  with many welcome tweaks to the suspension in 2003  The body roll is very minimal  as the body feels more rigid than did my 2001  On the open highway  the ride is as nice as to be expected in a car with the handling capabilities of this vehicle  if you want a smooth ride  opt for the same base engine in the Mercury Marauder  this is  after all  a supercar  Wet traction is also above average  with help of the car s Goodyear Eagle F1 tires and the standard traction control  I do at times find it easier just to reach down into the endless pool of torque and start out lazily in second gear in heavy rain to eliminate any rear wheel slippage  The ABS system on the car is very advanced  and even in panic braking in wet conditions  the car comes to a very confident stop  I have yet to experience it in snowy weather  but I am hoping that this car will have to experience very little of it with me residing in Georgia  The steering is firm and responsive  as is the clutch shifting engagement  though the shifter can be a bit quirky at times  The clutch does take some getting used to  as one person that I let drive the car put it  you ll have the legs of a linebacker after driving this thing every day  All in all  one couldn 146t ask for a better balance of ride quality and handling ability in a better package  That basically sums up each of the individual parts that are required to make up a good sports car  Tallying all of the scores  the Cobra is simple an achievement on the part of the Ford Special Vehicles Team  The Cobra unfortunately lost its competition from GM this year  with their F body cars no longer being produced after 2003  Authors note  the 2003 Cobra is faster than any F body GM offered in 2002  snicker  The price on this car at its release was  34 750  though many dealers across the country are price gouging it  anywhere from 1000 dollars over sticker to 10 000 in areas where the car is hard to get  I absolutely refused to pay a dime over sticker  and finally found an honest dealership here in Atlanta that was selling the car for the same sticker it got onto their lot with  The price tag on this car is a true steal  considering the next rival to this car is the Corvette Z06  the two vehicles are truly not in the same class  but as the 2003 Cobra is faster and more powerful than the stock C5 Corvette  the Z06 is its most loved comparison in the GM Ford war that 146s been raging since the 60 s  The base price tag on the Z06 is in the neighborhood of  51 000  For comparison s sake  a 1300 dollar investment into modifications will put the Cobra to a performance level of 500  Rear Wheel Horsepower  not that this author would every encourage the modification of such a beautiful automobile  Calling the 2003 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra anything less than a supercar would be underselling it dramatically  The 2003 holds the title of being the most powerful  5 more advertised horsepower than the 2000 Cobra R  Mustang to roll out of the Ford plant  and it carries the honor with flying colors  The Mustang platform is going to be retired for the 2005 model year in favor of a modified version of the Jaguar X type and Lincoln LS platform  code named DEW lite  One can only wait in stitches to see what kind of work of art the guys at Ford s Special Vehicles Team will produce on that platform
