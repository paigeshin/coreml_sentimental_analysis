 I am a recent buyer of the Ford Explorer  and out of all the car s and suv s I ve had this has been the best one yet  It has an extremely smooth ride and gets pretty good gas mileage for an suv  Best of all  depending on how you look at it  I was recently in a car accident with it  and by looking at the car  you would have thought I would have been seriously hurt  but I walked away with just a few bruises  The car has been repaired and it drives as good as ever  Knowing what I know  I have much comfort driving  Ford Explorer has been good to me br br
