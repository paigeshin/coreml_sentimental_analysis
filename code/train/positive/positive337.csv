 I had been driving an 1987 Ford Bronco selected by my husband who wanted a big vehicle  which was slowly rusting away over the last few years and beginning to have some mechanical woes  I started out shopping for a used small truck with automatic transmission  I didn t particularly want a 4x4  although had gotten out of some situations with the Bronco s 4 wheel capabilities  I looked on line  in classifieds and at local car dealers  It was very difficult to find anything to meet my needs  most trucks were standard transmission  and had high mileage Finally one of the dealers called  they had just gotten in a new 1999 Ranger XL which met my needs  It also had a 6 cylinder engine  which was strongly recommended over a 4 cylinder by my male relatives and trusted mechanic I m really glad I spent the extra money and brought this truck  It is easy to drive  and I feel secure in it  It s isn t as high off the road as the Bronco was  but enough height to feel I have adequate vision  The Ranger doesn t have too much room in the interior  My son  who is quite a bit taller  feels that his left arm is cramped against the door  I recently added a cap  and feel this makes the truck feel more solid now  For example  when I crossed train tracks the rear of truck would bounce  Now it holds the road better  I also added a floor mat and that seems to have made it a quieter ride  I think the a c and heater are really great and do their jobs well  the radio has good quality sound I have a cassette player which I like  as I often listen to speakers on tape I would recommend this truck to someone who wants a vehicle for every day use  I think it would be a uncomfortable for a large person  And a person who depended on a truck for business would probably want a long bed  But for my needs  it is super br br
