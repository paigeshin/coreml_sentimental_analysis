 My husband and I went on the dreaded search for the new  family car  We knew that we wanted an SUV  and were leaning toward the Tahoe  I come from a diehard GM family  My parents have leased 2 Tahoes in the last 4 years  and I had driven them frequently  I found them to be comfortable  however they always felt like they were top heavy when turning corners and such  I had read that the new Expedition had come out with flat fold seats  and I knew that we had to check this out  I have to admit  I never thought we would buy a Ford  but the minute I drove it  I LOVED it  It seems to have way more room in it than the Tahoe  My husband is 6 4  so we need all the leg room   head room that we can get  I also love the way that you sit up high  it seems to give a better view of your surroundings  The interior is very driver friendly  everything is within arms reach  The center console is HUGE  Lots of cupholders  even in every door  The seating is the real winner  Ford really designed this well  The 2nd row of seats are separated into 3 individual seats  which allows for any number of seating arrangements  Plus  the middle seat in the second row slides forward to be directly up against the console  It puts a infant right behind you  But for those of you without children  it allows for the people sitting in the 3rd row of seats to have a ton more leg room  We went on a 90 mile round trip with 6 very tall adults and everyone commented on how comfortable it was  They could not believe the leg room  The 3rd row fold down seats are the best  We knew that we wanted a 3rd row of seats for those rare times when we would need them  but we also knew that we did not have the room to store them  This was an answer to prayers  I find them very easy to put up or down  Overall  we are very pleased with this vehicle  It does tend to slurp up the gas in town  but what big SUV doesn t  It is very stable  turns on a dime  makes us feel very safe P S  My mom is jealous she hates her brand new Yukon
