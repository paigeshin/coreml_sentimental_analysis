 Last year  we decided to trade our family car for a sports car  We already had a Chevy Lumina  so we decided it was time to get rid of the unreliable Grand Am and go to a sporty car  We shopped around before deciding on what car to purchase  We test drove a Mitsubishi Eclipse  Chevy Monte Carlo  Mazda RX 7  Ford Probe and Eagle Talon  All the ones that we test drove were around the same year and handled relatively the same We went out of town to a car dealer to look and test drive more models  At the third dealer we came to  we told the sales person what we were looking for and the price range and he immediately directed us to a lonely  Ford Mustang  just waiting to be brought home by some lucky person  Without delay  we test drove this car  This Mustang is a 1997 LX V6 Automatic with power windows  power door locks  CD stereo system  dual air bags and power driver s seat  While looking this car over  we discovered that it only had 15 000 original miles on the odometer  We checked everything on the car  inside and out  and we decided to purchase  We got it for a steal at  12 500 After having the car for almost a year  I still love it as much as the day we bought it  Well  that is a little exaggerated because we have had a few small problems  but overall it is still great The engine in my  Ford Mustang  is a little short on power  but it will do for me  It does get good gas mileage  if I keep my foot out of it  In curves  I really do not like the way it handles  I had a Saturn 2 door coupe that would whip it in curves as far as handling goes  But this car cruises the highway very comfortably The fit and finish on my Mustang is great  Everything lines up and looks good  However  the dash and all the plastic molding on the inside do rattle and squeak but I will deal with this little annoyance because I love the car so much  The mounting pads in the strut tower tend to squeak really bad on bumps  Obviously all  Ford Mustangs  are like this because my husband had an  87 model that done the same thing  We have done routine maintenance on the car and that has kept this Stang in great working order  My hubby loves this car because it is one of the few that is still rear wheel drive  He likes the fact that the engine is sitting in the car the way it should be  In other words  he can work on the car easily The only major problem that we have experienced with the car is the check engine light coming on  The flap in the gas tank sticking open and not building up enough fuel pressure caused this  Once we took it to a dealer and had the problem corrected  we have not had any more problems But I will admit  it is not great for when kids are involved  A rear facing car seat will not fit into the small back seat  I now use a front facing car seat and do not have any problems  Even though we have experienced a few minor problems  I would still highly recommend the  Ford Mustang  to anyone wanting a good cruising car  The car is not only reliable  but is very sexy  It has a muscular stance and does not look like a catfish coming down the road like the Chevy Camaro  I am not knocking the Camaro because it is a great car too  but mine just looks better  LOL
