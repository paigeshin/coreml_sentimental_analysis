 I am extremely happy with this vehicle  I am a  over protective  mom of a teenage girl about to turn 17 years old  We gave her this vehicle a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT for her birthday and to ease up on our schlepping back  amp  forth during very hectic work weeks  Well  I was quite the wreck when she turned 16 last year and was got her drivers license  What parent isn t   We bought the Explorer from a private party who practically gave it to us  They didn t want the hassle of having every Tom  Dick  and Harry coming over to see it  After some initial repairs were made we brought it in to the owner s mechanic and had the front brakes done  along with the power steering unit everything else was in order we got the vehicle for  2 750  Yes  you read that right  Although it does have 90K miles on it  They were initially asking  4 000 then down to  3 000 then after repairs we had the gall to negotiate to  2500 we then settled on  2750  My daughter is the proud owner now and is quite smitten with her  brand new  SUV  I want it    I feel very comfortable with her driving it  It s a safe vehicle I like the size and sturdiness of it  She handles it beautifully  It even has a tilt sunroof for a  91  It s almost in excellent condition except for some minor rust on the underside and a missing handle on the inside  I highly recommend this vehicle br br
