 I pull up to the stop light and next to me I see a Porsche Boxster  But you see if I were in any other car I would sit back and stare in awe but I was in my brand new 2000 GT Mustang  This guy in the Porsche was over there thinkin look at this guy thinking he s got a fast car  well I m going to burn him  But when the light turned green i was gone before he could say a word  I love my mustang  I have loved mustangs since they came out  They have always been reliable cars and so far my 2000 has proved to be reliable also  The mustang is one of the sharpest  sleekest  best lookin cars on the road today  The style and performance is unbeatable for the price  If you are lookin for bang for the buck then this is the car for you  I got this car because I wanted a fun reliable car to drive around everyday  I got both out of the mustang  If you are single and want a good car for good money the Mustang is for you br br
