 For years prior to actually getting a drivers license  I have adored the classic  65 Ford Mustang Convertible  How could I refuse to love those curves  that massive design  that glistening red paint  and that spacious  leather interior  It was the car of my dreams  from the moment I fist lay eyes on it  Yes  I admit it  I was one of the many victims suffering from Mustang Madness  I vowed that I would buy that classic car and have it rebuilt and restored as soon as I could drive As the years went by  and Ford produced a new Mustang after Mustang that failed to inspire me  I remained true to the classic  65 model and I counted the days until I could have one  Now that the time to buy a car has rolled around  Ford comes out with a stunning new look to the old classic  This brand new classic in the making has the fine contour or a machine built for speed  instead of the luxurious comfort of the  65 version  When the brand new Ford Mustang first caught my eye  I knew I was in trouble  How could I stay true to the classic when this red  convertible  speed demon had hold of me  One look at this beautiful piece of American car and I  like many people  was hooked Ford has finally redesigned the Mustang to do the classic justice  Even though it was difficult to push the classic aside  I am thrilled to see that the Mustang is back with a vengeance
