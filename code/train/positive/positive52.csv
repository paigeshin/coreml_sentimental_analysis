 I m in the market for a new car and have been test driving lots of vehicles lately  When one is a serious candidate  I also look around for one I can rent for a couple days to take on a business or family trip to get a better feel for how it works for me in a day to day situation b i Most of the vehicles I ve been driving recently have been well equipped 4 door sedans in the  25 35 000 range  but a lot of my friends and neighbors have been buying big trucks  and I ve got to admit  there s a certain appeal to the truck  I ve had small Toyota trucks before and I always liked having the open cargo area  which gave me the flexibility of buying big items on impulse or doing home improvement projects easily  No need for delivery  I can just load that topsoil into the back of my truck  thank you very much b i I m a firm believer in considering as many options as possible in order to really know what s best and to really get the best deal  Comparing apples to oranges can be loads of fun when buying a car  A few days after driving the Ford F 150  I went into a Mercedes dealership to check out the C 230  The saleswoman asked what kinds of vehicles I was comparing to the Mercedes  I rattled off the de rigueur competitors  like the BMW 330 and Jaguar X type  then threw in  and a Ford F150 crew cab  The look on the woman s face was priceless   We don t compete with pickups  she informed me with a sneer  I had to struggle to keep a straight face b i Unfortunately for her  it is the  customer  who defines the competitive landscape   not  the salesman  and  definitely  not any suit wearing monkey from corporate marketing  She didn t understand that  and it s her loss because the C 230 was a good car and she  could  have gotten a sale if she was smart enough and quick enough to deal with a smart a s customer like me who happened to have been shopping with a checkbook in hand     i Smack i   We don t give a poop  Get back to talking about the Ford Oh yeah  right  This is a Ford F 150 review  Sorry about that  My impressions of this vehicle are based mostly on a 2 day weekend rental from Thrifty Car Rental  yes  some locations  do  rent pickups   by the way  here in Houston  Budget seems to be a good place to rent Ford Rangers if you like driving small pickups  I also test drove the King Ranch version at a local Ford dealer  but just as a 30 minute test drive   can t tell as much from that  but it s kind of fun to check out the fully loaded deal b i b Exterior Styling  Fit and Finish  and Etc  Too  I like the looks and styling of full size Ford trucks  They aren t as boxy and square as they used to be  but they still look utilitarian enough to be taken seriously as trucks and not as glorified cars with a little cargo space tacked on  which is I how I view some new trucks  which I will identify only as Ford Explorer  Nissan Frontier  and Chevrolet Avalanche     Ground clearance is excellent  even with the two wheel drive versions  Of course that means that short people are going to feel like they re forever climbing Mt  Everest just to get up into the thing  but that s the price you pay for driving one huge hulking chunk of Dearborn steel  If somebody complains  tell the girly man to get a Volkswagen b i I really like the  feel  of the F 150  Everything feels thick  heavy  and substantial  One of the things I didn t care for when I drove a Toyota Tundra was the way things  clicked  when they should have  clunked    do you know what I mean  I expect doors on a full size truck to feel  heavy   A thin door feels okay on a little Tacoma truck  but not okay on Tundra  What I want on the Tundra is a door that feels like the door on a F 150  It feels like a man s door  not like a little kid s door  Ditto on the tailgate  Ditto on the front hood  Toyota makes a good  reliable truck  I m sure of it  but they don t make a full size truck that  feels  as good as a Ford  Dodge  or Chevy full size truck b i i Right Bed for You i There s a bit of an on going debate over the  right  bed length for a full size truck  The problem is that with trucks like Ford s F 150 Super Crew  the overall length isn t really increased over what you get with a standard or extended cab   Ford s engineers simply stole the space for that back seat from the bed  The argument I always hear is  well  people don t carry stuff that requires a long bed     They don t  eh  Well  maybe a typical family doesn t often want to carry huge bulky things  nor do the firefighters depicted in Ford s oh so heartwarming commercials  but other people  do   Yes  the short bed will do fine for carrying boxes  boots  maybe even some rolled up fire hoses  What it won t do fine at is carrying the kinds of things that most people in the construction trades want to carry b i Think about it and think about what people who work for living typically want to carry  What length are most boards  Sheet rock  PVC tubes  Fence posts  Conduit  Ladders  Right  8 feet to 12 feet  Not 5 feet   at least not at the Lowes I go to b i In my opinion  the bed is  too short  on the Super Crew   especially for anyone considering this vehicle as a work truck  Yes  you  can  put the tailgate down  Yes  you  can  use one of those extender racks to give yourself a little extra occasional space  but don t those only give you about 7 feet max     In my opinion  the tailgate and extender strategy is  not  quite as good as having a genuine 8 foot bed  which you can also drop the tailgate down on giving yourself 10 feet  Some guys are  going  to want more space in the cargo area than you get on the typical Super Crew cab F 150     Before you buy this truck  think about whether the bed length is a problem for you  If you are a typical suburban mom who just wants a snazzy looking beefy vehicle to drive around town  then hey  no biggee  Go for it  But if you re working in the trades and thinking about using this vehicle  as a truck   then think long and hard about whether that bed is adequate  otherwise you ll be regretting the purchase for a very long time b i b Interior Comfort  Features  and More Etc  Too  The big draw on this big truck is the interior space  You get a real live back seat  genuinely usable back doors  and enough space to seat 5 comfortably  6 if you have a bench style front seat  even on longer trips  No more scrunching or using the back seat of extended cab trucks as seating only for contortionists and short midgets b i This is really the perfect truck for families  I like the looks of the extended cab better than the super cab  but for practical value and overall utility and comfort  the super cab is tough to beat  Because I m a dad  I always check out the back seat when I look at cars  I want easy access for moving car seats in and out and putting little people into their seats  I also prefer quite a bit of leg room  not so much to make things comfortable for adults  but so that little feet find it not so easy to kick the back of the drivers seat  Hey  We all have different perspectives on these things b i Most people are probably going to go for the XLT version of this truck because it offers everything that most people want today while at the same time  keeping the price somewhat reasonable  It s got a nicely appointed interior with automatic transmission  air conditioning  power windows and door locks  stereo with CD player  cruise control  captain style bucket seats with lumbar support and power adjustment on the driver side  and a console between the two front seats  As I said  a comfortable combination  Ford also offers a Lariat package  leather upholstery is the big plus there  and specialty versions called the King Ranch version and the Harley Davidson version b i i King Ranch package  The King Ranch version that I drove at Central Ford had the Highland Green paint  which is a very deep forest green  Together with the brown leather interior with the independent captains chairs in front  it was a sharp looking vehicle   no doubt about it     I wonder how well their  rugged  sales pitch is going to do  I sure didn t buy it  My opinion is that the King Ranch version is not a very practical vehicle for rugged use  I d call this truck the  Waltham Soccer Mom  edition  It s plushy  power everything  and too overloaded to be a real practical work truck  I could  never  see it really being used on a ranch  a construction site  nor anywhere else where rugged conditions prevail   Hey  Get your muddy boots off that plush pile carpet  You raised in a barn or sumpin  I laughed out loud when I saw the heated seats in the King Ranch version  Last I heard  the King Ranch was about as far south as you can be and still be on U S  soil  Do you know  where  the real King Ranch is  I do because I drive through it fairly often  It s in south Texas  only a couple dozen miles north of the Mexican border  It s an area where palms grow and coastal farmers raise grapefruits and ranchers raise as many cactuses as steers  Not exactly the kind of climate where heated seats might come in handy  Yep  on those icy cold 80 degree winter days when the nor westers blow through you really wanna crank up the heated seats  Sure  nuff  this is the truck for  real  Texas cowboys  Uh huh b i Don t even get me started on Ford s  Harley Davidson  package b Power  Performance  and Yet More Etc b The truck I drove had the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter Triton V 8 engine  With that powerplant  the truck was very responsive  Ford also offers a smaller 4 6 liter V 8 in the F 150s  but with only 220 horses at its beck and call  that seems too little for a truck as big and heavy as the F 150   especially if you plan to pull a trailer   220 horsepower is about what many family sedans have     According to Ford  this truck can tow up to 8 000 pounds and has a payload capacity of 1 765 pounds  Hmmm  I could even take my mother in law for a ride I was impressed with the handling of this truck  The advantage of shortening the bed and keeping the overall vehicle length about the same as with the extended and regular cabs is that the vehicle doesn t handle like a tank   The F 150 Super Cab has a 139 inch wheelbase  Sure  it s not going to corner like a Z3 would  but it turns tightly for its size and is easy to get used to  I don t see anyone having a problem handling this truck in normal suburban traffic b i The truck is equipped with power anti lock brakes and in normal driving conditions  the braking felt good  I don t recall trying a hard brake situation with this truck   sorry b i b General Impressions  Conclusions  and Any Remaining Etc b Official info on features  performance specs  pricing  etc  for these trucks is on the web at  www fordvehicles com trucks f 150 Prices are a bit high on the F 150   the one I drove runs about  27 000 MSRP   however  I have recently seen quite a few ads from Ford dealers in the local area offering these trucks with the XLT package at prices around  22K  I think  27K is too much for this truck  and I wouldn t pay that price  but at the  22K level  it becomes a a fair value and I might consider it seriously b i For my purposes  the Ford F 150 represents a pretty good package for use as a family car  and I might come back to it if I can t find a better deal elsewhere  Stay tuned for more info on the Great Car Purchasing Adventure of 2002  Til next time  see you in the showroom b i
