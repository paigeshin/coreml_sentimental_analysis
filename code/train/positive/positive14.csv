 I spent a lot of time researching and test driving many other vehicles before I made my decision to purchase my Ford Excursion  When I first started shopping I must admit that I was not even considering the Excursion  I drove practically all the SUV s on the market and while at my Ford dealership they put the Explorer  Expedition and Excursion side by side  The Excursion is indeed very big and intimidating at first  Then I drove each one  To my amazement the Excursion handled beautifully and much smoother than the Expedition or Explorer  I need a vehicle that can transport people and all their things  I also cook for 200 kids at a week long camp in the summer and the Excursion met all my criteria and then some  I filled it from one end to the other with food for one week  This is something that I required three vehicles to accomplish in the past  It handled the load like it weighed nothing  I use it to transport kids in a carpool to and from school  The things that impressed me when I was shopping is that it meets the Low Emission Standards for pollution in all 50 states  it has a blocker beam that absorbs most of the energy and keeps a smaller car from sliding under the vehicle in a crash  More than 85  of the vehicle can be recycled at the end of its life  and Ford has used recycled materials in producing this vehicle  It seats all my passengers comfortably with lots of elbowroom to spare  I have had 8 adults in this vehicle and they were all amazed at the spaciousness of the interior and all the creature comforts  We had a pull down monitor installed in the center part of the ceiling just behind the driver s seat and a DVD player along with an electrical outlet to plug in my son s Sega Dreamcast in the back of the console that fits between the driver s seat and the front passenger seat  It has been a lifesaver on the long trips we have taken with the kids and their friends  This is the first year that we have traveled in peace because everyone had their own space and was not touching the person next to them It is a bit of a shock at the gas pump filling up the 44 gallon tank  Most gas station s pumps shut off at  50 00 and it takes right around  60 00 to fill the huge tank  but I don t have to make a trip to the gas station as often as I used to with my old minivan  It averages about 12 miles to the gallon driving around town and about 15 miles to the gallon on long road trips  It took about two weeks of practice in and empty parking lot to learn to park it  It does not fit in many of the mall parking garages  You need at least 6 6 quot  of clearance room to fit in a parking garage  It fits in my home garage just fine  I have the back up sensors  I feel every vehicle should have back up sensors  It goes off if someone or a small animal walks behind the vehicle while backing up  It beeps faster as you get closer to an object and emits a solid tone when you are twelve inches away from an object or wall  It has a switch to shut the tone off while towing  It only emits the tone when you put the vehicle in reverse  I don t know how I ever lived without the seat warmers  I just recently used the Four wheel drive and it was so easy  You just stop the vehicle and turn the control on the dash to the four wheel drive setting you wish to use  When you are finished you stop and turn the control back to 2 wheel drive  That s a big difference from when my Dad used to have to climb out of his truck to put it into four wheel drive  It is a big step to climb up into it but it is nice to be able to see the roadway ahead  I know that my kids and passengers are safe  If you do not wear a seatbelt it will chime intermittently until the seat belt is fastened  I would recommend leather seats for easy cleanup  My family practically lives in this vehicle and it is so easy to clean them  You will be glad you spent the money  Even with adults it is amazing how much stuff can end up on the seats  The cargo space in the back is perfect for my dog s kennels and for putting everyone s stuff  The tailgate is split in half and very light weight and easy to open  I really liked it much better than the Suburban that has a bar that runs down the center of the glass  Its back gate is much heavier than the Excursion  I have had two hand surgeries and the Excursion s back doors are a breeze to open and close  It has big mirrors that can be folded in to give more room if you are in a tight spot and people need to walk by the vehicle  The mirrors also pull out for towing  I have had many people come up to me and ask if they can see my vehicle  I even had one guy sit in it for 20 minutes on a ferryboat admiring everything it had to offer  He decided that he would trade up for an Excursion that weekend  It takes a little getting used  I spent about a month getting used to it in some areas that were not very populated  Then eased into the city  I have had my Excursion since mid March of 2000 and one day in early May 2000  I noticed that I was truly confident in driving it  I do take a little more time in making lane changes and am very careful to check mirrors and the area around my vehicle  If anything I think I have become a more conscientious driver and I watch for areas that are more open in traffic to make maneuvers that require more time and space  The Excursion is a very versatile vehicle  It can be a very comfortable car and a very hard working truck  I have had many uses for it and it has given this busy Mom much more time and ease to get the big jobs done If you need to transport a lot of people and their gear or big loads of stuff  the Excursion will serve you well  It takes less gas to haul 8 people around in an Excursion than it does in two small cars  It s safe for your passengers and safer in a collision for a smaller car than any other SUV out there  It is also more environmentally friendly  I read on another review of this vehicle that it emits 6 pounds less pollution a year than other SUVs and as I said earlier more than 85  of the vehicle can be recycled when the car s life is over  The Excursion has good things to offer and they far out weigh any of the disadvantages of owning this vehicle  It is a pleasure to drive  You just need to be a responsible driver and take the time to get to know the vehicle just like you would any other vehicle  Be a safe courteous driver  Leave a little earlier so that you are not in a rush to get to where you are going  Don t talk on your cell phones while your vehicle is in motion  I pull over in a safe place and in my voicemail I mention I might be driving and to leave me a message and I ll call them back as soon as it is safe for me to do so  Most people are very understanding of this  SUVs are not all that bad  it s just the drivers that do not use their common sense while driving  Any car can become an assault vehicle if the person operating it does not do so responsibly  Driving is a privilege not a right  We do have the right to choose what we drive  I chose the Ford Excursion and I am willing to take on the responsibility to drive in a safe manor so that I can accomplish the tasks that I need to accomplish with it s assistance  It helps get the job done  I highly recommend it  You really have to drive it see what it is like Chris
