 I am the second owner of a cute little 1991 red Ford Tempo  My Tempo ha 114 000 miles on it and it is still running like a top  I payed  1 900 for it and so far it had been worth every single penny  My parents own a 1987 Tempo and they will tell you the same thing the Tempo is a great  reliable car  But back to my car  Tempos are great cars for the kind of conditions i have to endure  In the summer it is blazing hot  but the Tempo is fully equiped for that  The 91 model has a newer AC unit in it that always keeps the car comfortable  In the winter i have to contend with lots and lots of snow  The Tempo is great for that because of it awsome front wheel drive and its ability to start in sub zero weather  The previous owner of my Tempo was a college student like my self  She took excelent care of the car and it shows  My car has verry little rust  and the only matenence done on it so far is the 100 000 mile tune up and regular oil changes  The only disadvantages to the Tempo are it seats  it ability for top speed  and it breaks  The seats are very likely to make your back sore if you are driving for more than an hour straight  the Tempos top speed is about 70 miles per hour so freeway driving kind of sucks  and the break roters have to be switched quite often  Other than that the temo is a great affordable car
