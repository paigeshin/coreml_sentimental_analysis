 I give this truck a definite thumbs up  It is affordable and good looking  The Ford Rangers have come a long way since they first were introduced  This pickup truck has taken me where I wanted to go  and for a reasonable amount of money  There is nothing in this world that could compare to getting in my truck and taking it wherever I want to  It goes when you want it to  That s why I chose this truck  Although it is a challenge in the snow  I find that the good far more than outweighs the bad  It is comfortable  but could use a little extra leg room if you ask me  To drive this vehicle feels  secure  It s a safe vehicle  and knowing that makes it much easier  and more fun to drive  For someone who is looking for a powerful  safe  rugged midsize pickup  this is the truck I  personally  would suggest checking out br br
