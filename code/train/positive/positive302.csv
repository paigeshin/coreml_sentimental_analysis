 We did extensive research and drove every mini van in town  This is the fifth mini van that we have owned  but the first Ford  We love the car  The built in TV and VCR are wonderful for the kids  The car rides beautifully  has lots of room  nice features  and is generally a perfect car  So far   3 months  we haven t found anything about this car that we do not like  It even gets better mileage than was advertised  We recommend this car with no reservations  For the first time  we have chosen to lease  and this is also a good experience  We plan to get another Windstar in 2 years  and our lease payment is only  350 per month br br
