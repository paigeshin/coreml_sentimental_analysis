 I bought this car as a repairable for  3k and I am glad I did  In the condition I have it in now  it is valued at  6 000  Anyway  it is a great first car for a student and is very safe with dual front Air Bags  The seating is comfortable for about a few hours  then may get a little tiring  No long road trips  I was a little hesitant to get on the freeway  the car being so small in all  for the first time but a few times after  It was all right  I strongly recommend this car  I have had a great time driving this around town  Seeing it is so small  it can go anywhere   Not that far in deep snow  trust me on that one  I put a new Sony sound system  Yes  all Sony in a car  It sounds good  in it a few months after I bought it  the previous owner did not take care of the old one  I would recommend the four door model over the two door because it has Power Steering and it is easier for the rear seat passengers to get in  I would also recommend  for those in the North like me  to get one with a Rear defroster or have an after market one installed  I also recommend getting A C  Little cars with big windows get pretty warm in the summer  When looking for an Aspire  look for one with under 60 000 miles I bought mine with 43 000 on it and it has run fine  A friend of mine bought one with 96 000 and has had to have the transmission and various other things replaced  If Ford was still making the Aspire  I would send the  11 000 base price and buy another
