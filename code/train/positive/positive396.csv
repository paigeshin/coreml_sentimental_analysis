 OK  folks  here we go  for any of you that have been around long enough to see the introduction of the Ford Mustang in 1964  officially released as a 1964 1 2 model  I feel sorry for you  Not because you re old  bad joke  please take no offense  but because you had to see the Mustang go through a radical transformation from a true muscle car to nothing more than an expensive Pinto in the late 70 s  to an underpowered GT car in the late 80 s  to an even heavier  quot sports car quot  in the mid 90 s  But with the introduction of the newest Mustang comes many improvements over the previous generations  beyond your wildest imagination  First off  I should say that this is finally a sports car again  It s got a revised 3 8 liter V6  and although still a pushrod engine  makes a respectable 190 hp that hurdles the 5 spd coupe 0 60 in 7 2 seconds  This torquey V6 makes lots of its power down low and has over 220 ft lbs of torque that makes driving a whole lot of fun  coupled with a new rear axle ratio  and rear wheel drive  But the real fun is in the Mustang GT  with the V8  Having the same displacement and sharing many of the parts with the former 4 6 L V8  it produces 260hp  up from the old 215 hp V8 in 1998  Coupled with the 3 27 performance axle  it flies to 60 mph in 5 5 seconds  and gets to the quarter mile in 14 seconds flat at 100 mph  To put that into perspective  the much revered 1986 Lamborghini Countach took a full half second longer in the 1 4 mile  Kudos to Ford for finally making a Mustang that for once looks good  Not since 1969 has a Mustang turned so many heads  They new edgy styling will last longer than the sedan like styling of the last generation  and finally makes it look like a sports car  Although the scoops on the hood and behind the doors aren t functional  they do give it a sharp appearance  The all new 5 spoke wheels on the GT model are classy and sporty  and coupled with the 245 45 ZR 17 s help the Mustang to achieve skidpad grips of  86 G s  which haven t been equaled by Mustangs before with the exception of the Cobra s  The Mustang rides surprisingly well for a sports car  The ride is supple  and firm enough to have appropriate and confident handling on smooth surfaces  However  because it still has a solid axle and hasn t updated its rear suspension to IRS  independent rear suspension  since its introduction  it can get a bit spooky on uneven  bumpy surfaces  Aside from that  handling characteristics are favorable  with mild understeer  The BFG Comp TA tires are sticky enough to handle most situations  while maintaining a smooth ride  Although there are so many things to praise about this car  it s far from perfect  In a world where Japanese standards of fit  finish and ergonomics have heightened the level of excellence  the Mustang falls short of impressing me  The dash is attractive  but the instrument cluster can look a bit dated at times  The fit and finish of the car have much to be desired  as well  By far the worst thing in the new Mustang are its seats  both front and rear  The front seats are  in a word  unsupportive  I d rather drive cross country in a VW Jetta than this Mustang  For short rides the front seats are fine  but long trips find your back and behind sore and aching  The rear seats  if you can call them seats that is  give you enough legroom if you re about 7 or 8  For real sized people  you might want to hitchhike  I would advise all sports car enthusiasts who love the feeling of RWD and gobs of torque to buy this car  especially the GT V8 Mustang  In case you re wondering  it can be fairly convenient  because the trunk has more than adequate space for storage  On that note  it can be attractive to more than just speed freaks due to its large storage space and ease of use  By the way  like I said before it s a real head turned  Guys and girls both like the styling  especially of the convertible  So if the old adage is true about dating someone for their car  you might want to consider this one br br
