 I have purchased an 1989 SHO sedan with 97k miles  2 900 in 3 2000 vs   4800 book  and a 1990 LX sedan with 85k miles  3 000 in 8 1998 vs   4500 book  Both were mint condition  no damage and like new inside and nearly new outside  Both have proven to be solid cars  reliable  and safe  However  if you are considering these vehicles  you must get them at a price that allows you to address the maintenance and repairs that are common to this vehicle  The repairs that will typically cause the owners to sell are front axle boots drive joints  engine rear seal  oil leak  and cooling system leaks  particularly the heater block which is inside the fire wall and very difficult to replace  At times there can be engine block problems  particularly with the 3 8 engine  usually caused by people driving away without allowing some warm up time I didn t have the vehicles checked by a mechanic  I used my relatively good judgment on condition  After investing  1 000 in the 1990 and  1600 in the 89 SHO  I have two vehicles that are in my opinion as good as new  certainly good for 75 000 to 100 000 more   I care for my vehicles  currently with a Corsica 1990 at 193 000 and still going strong Since I was buying very well cared for cars and still had to pay for major repairs  I urge you to only purchase one of these vehicles at below book  even below average wholesale  For example  my SHO carried an average wholesale over  3000 and retail  4800  but I bought for  2900  You must anticipate these repairs  If the seller does not believe you  go to the NTSB web page and printout the repair and recall lists for the Taurus in those years and show them what to expect  I do not wish to scare you away with these stories  these are very good  solid cars if you find well cared for ones  However  the design has flaws which once fixed   and usually with upgraded Ford redesigned parts that replaced the original design  you end up with a super  very reliable car  Just anticiate the extra investment These are solid  heavy cars that even with no airbag or one airbag will often in an accident hammer the other vehicle as hard as a SUV  Remember  bulk and weight are very important when in an accident  the heavy guy usually wins  The SHO has a 5 speed  the LX an automatic  The LX is loaded with everything like climate control  electric seats  etc  all continue to work well  The SHO has many sport car luxuries  such as sun roof  fog lamps  powerful engine  etc  The automatic has had no problems  but the clutch plate for the SHO must be upgraded because the original is too weak  and will fail  If this was not done by the original owner  anticipate a  700 repair  by an honest good reasonable shop  twice that by a dishonest shop br br
