 This truck is the best vehicle that i have ever owned  My truck has 103 000 miles on it and never had a problem with this vehicle  I have put two sets of tires on the truck  The first set i put on were cheap tires so i went back to the stock Firestones that it comes with off the assembly line  I have the 2 3L engine  The engine is a little on the slow side but it runs great  It does have some decent power for its size  I would highly recommend this truck to anyone that is going to buy one  And just for some more reference my father owns the 93 Ranger XLT and it has 165 000 miles on it and it runs like a top
