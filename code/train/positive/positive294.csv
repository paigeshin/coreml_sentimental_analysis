 This is my first vehicle that is not a car  I have never owned a motorcycle  motorhome  pickup truck or anything else other than mostly big roomy sedans  I like my creature comforts when tooling down the highway enroute to one golf resort or another  With about a year left to go on the Oldsmobile I got to thinking about minivans  and decided to do some research  I relied  too  on a friend who is now in his third straight minivan  no Fords for advice on what  besides the cupholders  are the advantages of minivan ownership  I used the Internet to do the research  relying heavily on Kelly Blue Book  www kbb com   and www edmunds com  Both are really good sites whether you are buying or leasing  and whether it s a car or a truck  Bottom line is that between them and my buddy  although he is absolutely not a Windstar guy  I decided that if I was getting a minivan it was going to be Ford s  It was a close call over the Honda Odyssey  Truth is there are a lot of great vehicles out there nowadays  Maybe you won t go wrong with any of them  but I am thinking that for the money you can t get much safer or more comfortable  I ve been driving mine now for about four months  and I believe that I am ready to evaluate it  I don t know much at all about the technical stuff  but I do know that I am satisfied with the gas mileage  The ride is nice  of course  when your vehicle is new you are careful to miss most bumps larger than a bottlecap  but nevertheless I did not miss a few and I can tell you from experience  It s a nice ride  I got the SE model with the  quot radar quot  in the back  That s the rear sensing system that saved me from an accident in a supermarket parking lot this past week  I never saw the guy  and I never would have had a chance if it wasn t for that alarm going off just in the nick of time  It s been the better part of 30 thirty years since I hit something I wasn t aiming at  and I can tell you I am real grateful for this alarm system  It would have been a minor ding I am sure  but it would have ruined a great driving record  Thanks again Ford  If this model doesn t have enough bells and whistles for you  well I gotta tell you that you are pretty spoiled  No matter though  they have two others  I think  loaded with even more stuff if you have to have it  The right side back door opens and closes at the push of a button  That s pretty neat  makes me wish I had gotten the left door that way too  You know what else is pretty neat  the outside mirrors   not only are they  quot powered mirrors quot  they are heated  To melt the ice which we will be getting our fair share of starting any day now  No more scraping mirrors  Works for me  I could go on with what I like about it  but if you re looking to buy one of these or one of the competition s versions  then I better tell you what I don t like about it as well  Gotta be fair  The right front door cannot be opened with a key   there is NO keyhole  My vehicle has  quot keyless entry quot  so I shouldn t complain  but I don t keep that little  quot doo jigger quot  on my keyring  It s my emergency backup in case I stupidly leave my keys in the car  again  and sometimes it would be handy to access that door with a key  For someone else or for packages  for example  I am not crazy about my cupholders  The ones in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer  Well  they re a little chintzy if you ask me  I don t trust them to hold my medium diet pepsi  and they don t hold my coffee mug  So  what are they good for  Like the song says  quot Absolutely Nothin quot  The only other thing that really bugs me is the back door lift gate or whatever they call it  If anything ought to be  quot powered quot  this is it  I m guessing that if there is one feature that costs Ford the most customers this would have to be it  I believe that the Ford people would do well to hire themselves a woman engineer to check this door out from the point of view of people who are less than 6 1  220  and make it so it s a wee bit more user friendly  Dumbest door I ve ever seen  If you are thinking minivan for your next purchase  You might want to just take my word for it  I did the research  Windstar is a good deal br br
