 I d been riding a motorcycle exclusively for eight years  when I decided the time had come to get back on four wheels for awhile  The mean streets of Phoenix  Arizona are not known for their kindness to two wheelers I had looked at a number of sporty cars  and I was also considering a pickup to help out with the household chores  After driving a bike for so long  the  fun factor  outweighed practicality and the truck idea was shelved The muscle car era was over before I got my first license  but there are still a few cars out there that continue to capture the spirit of the original pony car The 2002 Mustang GT incorporates the long hood  short trunk style of the first 64 1 2  Any  Stang enthusiast will also recognize the channel extending from the front quarter panel to the rear simulated brake scoop on each side  The  dual cowl  dashboard and mustang emblems on the seats also evoke memories of the classic Ford ponies Unfortunately  both the brake scoops and hood scoop are tacked on for show  While that previous era Cobra Jet could claim some performance gain from increased air flow  all these decorations get you is a more difficult time washing your car  Water just loves to adhere to the hood scoop honeycomb front and release after the hood is dry  With typical Arizona hard water  this will leave long water streaks for you to clean again  I find the  02 brake scoops overdone  while the previous years I found stylish There are 2 GT models  the Deluxe and Premium  I found the Deluxe quite acceptable  and in fact have only one added option  the Mach 460 sound upgrade  When I bought the car I wanted no options  but the only black 5 speed manual on the lot had the 460 sound system   460 stands for 460 watts peak output I must say  factory car audio has improved greatly since my last car  I m one who traditionally ripped out the factory system within days and replaced it with something listenable  I have no such desires after 2000 miles of driving in my GT  With a 6 CD changer in dash  MP3 compatible  plenty of speakers and all optimally placed  I have enjoyed this system far more than any other I ve ever had  The DSP  effects  are worthless  but there is one set of modes I ve found invaluable  Setting for  Driver Only   All Seats  or  Rear Seats  really does work as advertised  and perfects the sound for those areas You won t be using  Rear Seats  much  unless you have a dog or children  The backseat does not have enough legroom for any normal sized adult  The driver seat is just big enough for my husky 5 11  frame  but I would imagine it s tight for those over 6  The driver s seat is powered and firmness can be adjusted  but it feels like a compromise   some comfort  some support The GT Deluxe comes with 17  alloy painted wheels  This means a bit more care when it comes to cleaning them  but they look great  You ll appreciate them if you re a fan of curvy  mountain roads  ABS and traction control also add to the feeling of control when pushing this car  but if you just  have  to do a big  tire smoking burnout and fishtail  you can disable traction control with a dashboard switch Make no mistake  the GT is fun to drive  The dual exhaust provides a throaty  reassuring feedback whenever you step into the gas pedal  It is subdued enough that you won t be annoyed by it during everyday city driving  You can always crank up the tunes if you opted for the Mach 460 sound  there is an even better Mach 1000 option I do have an unfavorable reaction to stoplights  With the hot summers and excessive traffic in Phoenix  the asphault near stoplights is often heavily worn  Startingly deep ruts appear in the road surface at times  While all vehicles have a tendency to follow these ruts  a biker s nightmare  the Mustang seems to me a bit worse than normal in this regard  It tends to show the most during a firm brake for a stale yellow light About 80  of my driving is stop and go  city traffic driving  I get 19mpg just about every tank  On a long trip I once broke 23  and the very first tank was 17 I am absolutely happy with this purchase  I love driving it  and I have been spoiled by seriously fun motorcycle driving  It looks great  and though the car gets it share of attention  you don t look like you re having a mid life crisis or compensating for something  I hope Ford continues to manufacture this pony for a long time  as this style gets harder and harder to find  see Camaro
