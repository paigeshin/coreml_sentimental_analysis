 I bought my 1992 Escort GT over three years ago  It had a little under 60 000 miles on it  which was less than it should have I bought it because it fit my budget  but was still sporty  After living with this car  I can recommend it to other buyers The body  interior  engine  and transmission of my car are all in excellent condition  for their age  The only major mechanical problem I had was when the timing belt snapped  but that should have been replaced at 65 000 miles  which it wasn t As far as driving  it is a very pleasant vehicle  relatively quiet  very secure and stable  I have a manual transmission  and the engine revs through the power band eagerly  Redline is at 7000  which allows a quick launch  and an impressive sprint to 60  Torque steer can be felt  particularly during hard acceleration or turning  but it isn t unreasonable  The available power is plentiful  and the car  coupled with a manual  really does return a satisfying driving experience The interior ergonomics are good  with the placement of the air conditioning and stereo within arm s reach  Each door features storage compartments  as well as the large glove box  Since this is a coupe  entry to the back seat can be difficult for adults The hatchback allows an ample amount of space for groceries  luggage  even large items  With the seats folded down  I ve been able to transport 27 quot  televisions  as well as an assortment of other things  all at the same time Two sore spots for my particular car have been the brakes  and an odd electrical problem that causes the car to stall  I ve replaced three out of four brake calipers  and have had no success in tracking down the electrical problem  Another thing a potential buyer should be aware of  the GT model of this car has the underpinnings of a Mazda Protege  Furthermore  replacement parts for this car commonly come from a Mazda dealership  or an independent foreign auto parts supplier  The powerplant is all Mazda electronics  including the starter  another replacement I have made  Overall  I didn t expect the phenomenal reliability my particular car has afforded me  Besides the infrequent electrical problem  the car has rarely had any mechanical problems  As with all used cars  do a thorough inspection of all fascets of the automobile before purchasing it  and I suspect you will find a reliable  cheap  economical  yet fun automobile br br
