 I have had my  1991 Ford Explorer XLT  for a little over a year  I bought it with 105 000 miles on it  During this time I have driven it for over 30 000 miles  I have had it in the shop only for scheduled oil changes and tire rotations I drive every day for work in all weather conditions  I also drive my Explorer off road from time to time  The Ford Explorer runs well and has excellent handling on snow and ice as well as in the mud  I was particularly happy with my Explorer on December 28  1999 when I was driving to Columbus from Cleveland as the first winter storm of the year blew through blanketing the streets with snow and causing white out conditions  I was driving south on US23 toward Columbus and I counted 14 cars along the side of the road  One accident was a 6 car pile up  After seeing these accidents  I was cautious but I felt comfortable in my Explorer  Needless to say I arrived home safely and I credit much of my safety to my Explorer I have compared it to a Chevy Blazer of a similar year and the Blazer does not compare  Not only does the Explorer have more storage room  it is also much more comfortable to drive My Ford Explorer is very reliable and I feel safe driving it  I highly recommend the purchase of a Ford Explorer br br
