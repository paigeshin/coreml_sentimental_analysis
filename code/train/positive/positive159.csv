 I purchased my new Windstar on January 9  1998 and have driven it some 36 350 miles  I keep complete computer records on mileage  maintenance  and repairs and would like to report that I have averaged 23 07 mpg during this time with a low mileage of 17 65 and high mileage of 27 25 mpg while always using regular unleaded fuel in this V 6 3 8L engine  About one third of my driving is on interstates and the balance is short trips  I view the Windstar as reliable  but the following items had to be addressed  to wit  1  replaced both headlight assemblies due to moisture invasion  2  replaced the transmission field sensor  3  repaired the transmission due to a faulty mid range part  4  replaced a cruise control assembly  5 replaced a defective driver side door window activator  and 6  re calibrate the computer  This sounds like a lot of work  but all was replace under warranty by my excellent Ford dealer and the vehicle is performing well I really like the excellent ride probably due in part to the larger 121 inch wheelbase  The van is relatively quite and is most responsive during acceleration and de acceleration
