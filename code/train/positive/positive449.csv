 Ford Winstars are the coolest minivans on the market  well i guess as cool as you can get for a minivan  All of a sudden all of the other minivans look alot like the windstars  way to go to set the trend  Fords minivan the windstar is about loaded with all the options that you can think about  The come well equipped with a great safety package  actually the best one out  They have pretty good power  and run rather well  My Mom has one and its got alot of miles on it now and it still runs nicely  the only bad thing is the transmission  our driveway is slanted upward and when you put it in reverse to go down the driveway it pops into gear instead of just going into it  That is my only complaint well that and they hub caps were so good that someone stole them from us but oh well  we can get more br br
