 My wife purchased this car new in 1995  She wanted a laser red 5 speed GT  and we were able to find one at a local Ford dealer  We drove both an SE and a GT for comparison  The GT is a totally different car  Fast and sprung stiffly  it is a real sports car  Our car is not loaded  no sunroof or leather  but has air  cruise  CD player  power locks  remote keyless entry  and a few other goodies Once we had the car  we did run into several problems  all of which were minor  A leaky radiator cap  pealing paint on the hood  broken seat air pump for the bolster   I think maybe a few others I forgot about  All were corrected under warrenty  I worried about the paint the most  but they seemed to be able to fix this and it has not been a problem  We have replaced a battery  spark plug wires and tires  The Goodyear Eagles were done at about 35 000 miles  We replaced them with Parnelli Jones all seasons which work very well I now drive this car daily  and it is simply a joy to drive  It has about 50 000 miles and has been pretty much trouble free the last few years  It handles superbly   so much so I wish it had 20 or 30 more horsepower  The steering has great feel  This car is on a rail  The stick shift is fantastic  with quick shifts and smooth operation  I am 6 3 quot  so I do have to squeeze myself into this car  but I can get comfortable   no one can sit behind me though  The car has a large trunk and the seats fold down to offer tons of space for hauling larger items  Finally   what a sweet looking car  Wish I had something this cool back in high school  On the down side  the rear seats are not usuable for kids if you are tall like me  I have a car seat on the passanger side and have to move the passanger front seat up quite a bit in order for the seat to fit  No way we can get a 2nd child behind me  so this car s days are numbered  The ride is quite stiff  I mean STIFF  Everyone that rides in this car comments on it  You do adjust driving it daily  but it is just not very comfortable for any long trips  The paint seems to be of a lower quality than most cars  In spite of regular washing and waxing  this car is showing a few flaws  Nothing terrible  but I worry about it  Lastly  the V 6 is starting to burn a small amount of oil   about a quart every 3 000 miles  It still runs perfect   22 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway I plan to trade or sell this car soon  and re sale looks pretty bad  Oh well  it was fun while we had it  This is a great car for a single guy or girl   or a couple with no kids  Or a teenager that wants to make it into a SCCA solo racer  This is not a family car   but that is part of the fun br br
