 UPDATE At 87 000 miles  2003  our power steering lines leaked  They cannot be replaced without purchasing the whole Rack   Pinion Power Steering line kit  Cost us  422 at the Ford dealership Also  we have been having what appear to be electrical problems instrument panel lights coming on going off intermittently  Our ABS light  parking brake light and door ajar lights alarm constantly come on and go off  Sometimes the interior van light will stay on when the ignition has been turned off  We went through all fuses   relays but could not find a problem  The Ford dealer could not find the problem so they didn t fix it  Very frustrating We decided to purchase our  97 Windstar from a Chevy dealership in 1999  We made this decision mostly because we had just had our 2nd child and also own a large breed dog who occasionally will take a ride with us  In short  we wanted a roomier vehicle  not to mention our cars were now 11 and 13 years old  We also didn t want to buy a new vehicle that would depreciate as soon as we drove it off the lot  We bought several consumer books and did our research on minivans to decide which we would like  The Windstar won over all others  mainly for it s safety record but also for it s price I have to say that even though my 1987 Nissan Maxima was getting old  I will always miss all the features that had me  spoiled  Boy  how I wish that I didn t have to keep opening the front door to lock unlock all of the other doors without using the key for each one what a pain  What feature really burns me up isn t really even an extra  option  It s is the simple fact that you cannot close the outside front vents and keep the fan running without having to turn on the A C or turn the fan off completely  I can t say how many times I ve gotten behind a tractor trailor with smoke and exhaust billowing out it s stack and have had to either turn on the A C or turn off the heater just so that the smoke didn t get inside the van  Every car I ve known from a Ford Escort to an Acura Legend has had a control for outside inside air vents On the plus side  the ride is great not at all like a  truck  it has cup holders for each row  a sliding rear seat and seats that remove easily for more cargo space  One of the best features of all is the rear A C and heat vents which help heat up or cool down the large interior faster than just using front vents  It also has stereo controls and a headset jack in the middle row great for the kids as long as they don t fight over it  It handles very well  does not sway and has a smooth ride  has very good visibility   you can see the road  not just the hood  and the anti lock brakes are excellent  I also love the fact that you don t have to  climb  up or duck down to get in So far  so good  We haven t had any major problems with our Windstar  though we did purchase an extended bumper to bumper warranty from the dealer and that s probably why just our luck  Only annoying break dust that makes a couple of squeaks when we back out of the driveway UPDATE  After a couple of visits to our mechanic for a noisy belt  the mechanic notified us that this is a common problem on Ford vehicles  He told us there is really nothing we can do  This along with the noisy brakes   vent problems has us considering another make for our next purchase
