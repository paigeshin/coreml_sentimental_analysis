 When we first married  my husband and I thought there wasn t any need for one of those staid  quot family quot  vehicles  the 90s equivalent of the station wagon  It didn t take long  two kids  to realize what the attraction is all about The Windstar first caught my eye by being the only US made minivan that had received a 5 star frontal crash rating from the U S  government  Interest piqued when the Insurance Institute showed us all how bad an off set crash can be  Now I had to drive one of these for myself The base Windstar GL is a no frills van  with the 3 0 L engine producing 150 hp  Not enough for someone trading in a Ford Mustang 5 0  so we decided that at the least we needed the optional 3 8 L V 6  which produces a more satisfying 200 hp  Vroom Vroom  The 3 8L engine also provides very sufficient power for highway merging and passing  and is fairly fast off the start line  ok  my nickname used to be  quot Mrs  Andretti quot  Match this with the 4 speed transmission  and we are ready to roll  Literally Since we knew that we would spend part of the ownership time in warmer climates  we sought a van with the rear air option  This can be operated by the controls on the dash  or the controls set into the pillar behind the driver  the B pillar in guy speak  Air flows into the cavernous rear area from a vent on the same pillar  and from four other vents  two above the middle seat  and two above the third seat  We have not had any problems with the A C  even living in muggy Hawaii  The van also cranks out some heat  enough to have to lower the settings after only a few minutes   Did I mention we used to live outside Seattle  hmm Minivans overall tout seating for seven  with Ford not being an exception  We have found that two adults can sit comfortably in the third seat with a child  but three adults in that seat are a tight fit  The seats themselves are very comfortable on long trips  but you pay for that feel when lugging them out  For smaller people  this could be a two person task  The third bench folds down onto itself  and rolls forward to touch the middle bench  opening up the rear cargo area even more  Ford had the correct intentions when installing tether strap anchors in the Windstar  putting two on the middle bench and one on the front passenger seat  That s correct  one under the front passenger seat  This puzzles me even more when I note that they neglected to put even one on the third row bench Most buyers in the market for a larger vehicle have come to expect that you pay for the safety and roominess at the gas pump  Again  Ford is right there in the pack with all the other auto makers  We average about 17 mpg in the city  and 23 highway  The 20 gallon tank keeps me from living at the local supply hut  gas station  but it does hurt when refueling  On newer models  Ford now offers a 26 gallon tank  but that could just be delaying the inevitable Our van of choice was a great find at a Washington dealer  For  16 000  we ended up with exactly what we were looking for  We have many options available with the LX such as the roof rack  aforementioned rear air  privacy glass   quot Premium Sound quot  system  more speakers basically  power locks and windows  and headrests for every seating position except the third bench  middle seat  The power rear quarter windows are great for airing the van out  and the power side view mirrors make an easy task of adjusting for individual driver tastes  The only option lacking from the step up is the power driver seat  which may be more hassle than it is worth  The 1998 Windstar has a good list of standard options  ABS brakes  dual front airbags  nicer cloth seats than some other auto makers  Plymouth comes to mind  power steering and brakes  height  adjustable seatbelts for front passengers  tilt wheel and cruise control  which has controls set into the steering wheel itself  With the 1998 model only  Ford delayed jumping on the driver side sliding door addition in a very interesting way  The driver door is longer than other model years  and the driver seat is positioned on rails  The seat will slide up against the steering wheel  allowing easy access through the doorway  When I first saw this option  I wondered what idiot thought of this  I didn t see a need for entry on that side  not with a 5 ft  entryway on the other  Ahh  motherhood  As the mother of two small kids  my husband and I can position ourselves on each side of the van to load kids  The space left open behind this seat is large by any means  I can stand hunched over  adjusting my daughter s car seat  and I am 6 ft  tall  While I envy the driver side door  since it would be a much easier option  I know I would lose the convenient cupholder  recessed bin  and rear A C control access that my 4 year old has right there  The drive  The van can t corner on rails  and I wouldn t recommend trying it  but it does have a comfortable ride  Small bumps in the road are hidden  the steering wheel has a solid feel to it  and very little road noise intrudes into the cabin area  At highway speeds  some tire noise is heard  but it is not very loud  We recently had to have the transmission rebuilt  under warranty  thank you Ford  and it was a little soon in the life of any vehicle  at 35 000 miles  Oh those pesky AXOD transmissions  Ford is reputed to have known of problems with certain transmissions linked to certain engine sizes  but luckily we were able to have ours fixed under warranty  Because of the infamous 3 8L engine  head gasket problems and transmission problems  I can t give my van 5 stars  as much as it pains me to admit After over a year of ownership  we don t know what we would do without this wonderful invention called the minivan  I do have to note that it has been to the shop twice this year  the  quot check engine quot  light came on  requiring a trip to the dealer for an evaporator and an oxygen sensor replacement  It was during this visit that the dealership noted for us the transmission hesitation  and scheduled us for a second visit  The service department at the local Ford dealer was very helpful  as dealerships go  When it was determined that necessary parts had to be ordered from the mainland  the dealership paid for a 3 week car rental  my choice  Ford Explorer  heehee  All of this was covered under warranty  so our only out of pocket costs so far have been for oil changes  Anyone in the market for a used minivan  looking for the safest  used  van available  Well  you just found it
