 This is one of the best cars that ford has ever made This 91 Taurus has been a great family car for us since we bought it We ve put over 80 000 miles on it and it s only been in the shop once for minor repairs It has been a very dependable car throughout the years There have been a few recalls on it but they were not major ones Overall this Taurus has lasted us longer than any car we have ever owned It s great for driving in snow and on ice has lots of moving room in car The engine and transmission is still going strong without any problems I use to hear and read many reviews on a Ford Taurus about how they were the top seller every year and I strongly agree with that I love the power steering cruise control and the front wheel drive I will always stick to buying a Taurus because it s worth every dime  I highly recommend anyone out there that is looking for a dependable and long lasting car buy a Ford Taurus because they keep going going going br br
