 When I first started looking for another car  I knew I wanted an SUV of some type  I do a lot of traveling on the road and I like to have room for all of my luggage  camping gear and emergency equipment as well as my passengers  This baby does it all with room to spare and good gas mileage too I had looked at the Montero  the 4Runner and the Blazer first  The Montero is nice and roomy  but the mileage sucks  it s expensive and the insurance on them is outrageous for someone my age  21 at the time  Then I looked at the 4Runner  Nice  decent mileage and it has a fair sized cab  but again the insurance was killer plus they seemed to be breaking down a lot and were not cheap to fix  Now the Blazer was really nice  Good mileage  fairly cheap insurance  but it was really  really small inside  The back seats were barely there Then I came to the Ford dealership  They showed me a few Explorers and I was hooked  They have a good V 6 engine  good sized front and back seats  plus a decent storage area in the rear for all my gear  It also has an adjustable luggage rack on top and it got 20 miles to the gallon highway and 17 city  Mine is the 1991 Sport Edition so it only has 2 door  but that s all I need anyway  It is a 5 speed manual transmission  a must for me  and it has push button 4 wheel drive with low range  It also has a main dome light and 2 reading lights for the driver and front passenger  I signed the papers for it the same day and I have not had anything to complain about since then  and that was almost 4 years ago  I have had it in the shop for basic maintenance and had to have the radiator and water pump replaced  my fault though  but other than that it has run great for me  It always starts for me no matter what the weather is  I have started it in 100  and in  40 below without any problems  Also  when they say 4 wheel drive they mean all 4 wheels  Not one front wheel and one back wheel like some other companies do Really the only thing I can complain about is that there is only one cup holder and it is inconveniently located behind and below the shifter knob  No problem for soda cans but a Burger King cup gets knocked out every time I shift to third gear  Other than that minor bit  it s a great SUV and I couldn t be happier  I just topped 100 000 miles and I m sure I ll see 200 000 easy br br
