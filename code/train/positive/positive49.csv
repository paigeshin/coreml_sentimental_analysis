 I bought this vehicle in February of 1996  when it had first been released  The dealer had it before I did  and the car was in excellent condition with about 3000 miles on it  Fully loaded  I love this car  I was in the military for a while and it got me from Texas to New Jersey almost twice a year if not more  This is the best vehicle I have ever owned  It is fun  sporty and reliable  I get a smooth ride out of it EVERY time I drive  no matter what the road conditions are like  If you like this type of  quot luxury quot  vehicle without the prices  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who loves to drive and look good br br
