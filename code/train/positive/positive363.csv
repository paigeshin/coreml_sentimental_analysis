 I do not actually own this 2001 Ford Taurus  My parents own it  I own a 1991 Camaro and am used to a pretty uncomfortable ride  I am also used to extreme acceleration  The Taurus has got the RIDE covered  It does not have the ENGINE covered Every time you start out riding in the Tuarus  weierd engine noises accur  A sort of rattling and clanking if you will  It is a brand new car  so I DO NOT expect anything like that to be happening  It also has a really hard time starting up and idiling at start up if it is cooled out The Main and worst problem about this car is the pick up speed  very very pooor  We took it to the shop and told them of the poor pick up and they said its running fine Throttle response is very poor  You can push the pedel up and down when travling above 50 or so and nothing will happen until you take it all the way to the floor  Keep in mind that it is only a LX and is not a sports car  but that is saaad  Also the radio is not very loud either But  it is very very roomy with plenty of head room and leg room  especially in the back seat  Very large trunk space to put my bodies  I mean  No noise from the outside when in the car with the windows up
