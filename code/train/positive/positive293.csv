 The ubiquitous minivan is frequently sold on consumer feel good items such as the placement and size of cup holders  the presence of map pockets or the number of zones in which the climate control can be split   Ford s 2000 Windstar  does well on these creature comfort areas  but excels in safety and reliability   critical areas for the family oriented minivan market segment  I just spent a week driving the Windstar through a variety of street and weather conditions  This is the third minivan I ve test driven in the last five months  and so far  is my favorite  I still haven t driven the  Honda Odyssey  which has better all around numbers  but the  Windstar performs better than the Plymouth Grand Voyager and its Dodge Caravan twin   Since this was Dodge s baby to begin with  that s a hard statement to write  but Ford has done a terrific job with this van b THE RIDE  Feel the acceleration  The Windstar has plenty of get up and go  There s a 3 8 liter V6 with 200 hp  more of both than the Odyssey or the Grand Caravan  This van has torque to spare with 240 foot pounds at 3600 rpm  again better than both vehicles  I found myself passing slower moving vehicles with just a tap on the responsive accelerator  There was always plenty of power left over to respond to changing road conditions I also found the ride itself to be smooth  The Windstar weighs a good 100 pounds more than the Grand Voyager  and although neither are in serious big SUV territory at just under 4000 pounds  they are solid  The Windstar s wheelbase is bigger than I would have liked  at over 120 inches  contributing to a bigger than expected turning radius  Several times I found myself faced with the choice of making a three point turn or doing some curb cutting  I knew that acceleration was there for some reason The Windstar s critics have complained of the same top heavy  swaying feeling I found in the Grand Voyager   I didn t find much swaying at all  even when accelerating in curves   In fact  the biggest criticism I could find on the ride was that there is a small but significant blind spot just off the right rear bumper  Some jiggling with mirrors restricted from field of vision to other sides  but stopped me from driving several smaller cars off the road b SAFETY  Let s face it  Families buy minivans  And along with reliability  family buyers treasure safety above every other attribute  Airbags  including side airbags  are standard on this vehicle  but that only comprises a small portion of safety  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA or http www nhtsa gov  is the agency responsible for crash testing vehicles for the federal government  They gave the Windstar 5 stars out of a possible 5 for crash worthiness  A safety group run for the insurance industry  the Highway Loss Data Institute  found that the addition of the side air bags made the Windstar one of the safest passenger van in its 40 mph crash tests  The van finished third behind the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey in their tests  This was actually a step down for the Windstar  which used to be rated as best in its class  but the Odyssey s redesign catapulted the 2000 model over the Windstar  Still  these three vehicles were the only ones to receive HLDI s overall  good  rating in their class Self sealing tires and a reverse sensor system that alerts the driver when the rear bumper is within five feet of something are safety options that are well worth considering  Ford has packaged multiple options into several safety packages  so depending on what you want to put on your van  you might find it cheaper to buy a package than to add single options b CREATURE COMFORTS  The very first thing I noticed when I settled into the driver s seat was the ledge over the window well  It s a perfect height for resting a driver s arm  yes  I know you should drive with two hands on the wheel  These little things  like the aforementioned cup holders and map pockets  make a surprising amount of difference in overall consumer protection  And speaking of the cup holders  the two recessed under the ashtray in the front were adjustable and fit different sized cups with a simple squeeze of the ratcheted plastic ring  I was very impressed with the interior lighting  which gave plenty of directed illumination at night without making it difficult to continue driving  Even the climate controls for the passengers in the rear two rows are illuminated at night   a nice feature that not every minivan shares The stereo was big and bold sounding with the requisite tuning and pseudo equalizer buttons  I particularly liked the oversized radio station buttons The stems off the steering wheel were the only item that caused me concern  On the right side stem  the driver finds the gear shift lever with the overdrive button recessed into the tip  That s simply annoying design  but the dangerous design is on the left side stem which controls turn signals and dual interval wiper systems  On more than one occasion  I signaled for a left turn only to unexpectedly spray the windshield with fluid and start the wipers  The turn signal control is a silly place to put a wiper button anyway  That said  the dual interval wipers are neat and do a tremendously good job in maintaining visibility through even heavy rain Interior visibility is terrific  however  thanks to a mini mirror that swings down between the driver and passenger seats in front  This is not intended as a rear view mirror  but as a way to watch folks even in the back row  Parents with kids are going to love this feature because it doesn t detract at all from the rear view mirror and is easily seen from either driver or passenger seat Finally  the killer comfort issue was found on the fourth door  Yes  the Windstar is available as a four door unit too  perfect for families who can enter on driver or passenger side  I also found that the bucket seats in the second row were nice and roomy while the third row bench seat easily folded down or was removed   THE BOTTOM LINE  Auto dealers are still getting near sticker price for the Honda Odyssey  last year s minivan darling  If price is a factor at all  I find that the Windstar stacks up very favorably against the Odyssey and now is the time to buy 2000 models since the 2001s are now in stock  Ford is also trying to move the 2000 units and has a  2500 customer cash offer out through October 31  That gets you 10  of the way there if you use the money down  and based on your trade  you might even be able to lower your payments if you mix  1000 cash back with a Ford Motor Credit APR offer  Until I get a chance to drive the Odyssey  Ford s Windstar has leaped to the top of my minivan list
