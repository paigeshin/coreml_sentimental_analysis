 I own a 1998 Ford Taurus and I have been very pleased with it  I bought it in November of 1997 and haven t had an ounce of trouble with it  We bought this vehicle because I had previously been driving a Pontiac Grand Am and after the birth of our second child we decided that we needed more space  I am in my twenties and I wasn t ready to get  quot the family van quot  and felt that the Taurus looked sporty or  quot cool quot  enough but still served the purpose of a family car  Some of the many things that I love about this car is the stereo system the sound is great  The engine is quiet so quiet that one time when I was in a huge hurry I actually ran into a store and left my keys in the ignition and left the car running  I didn t realize until I returned to the car  thank goodness it was still there  that I had forgot to turn the car off  I also love how quickly the car cools off in the summer and warms up in the winter  We ve driven this car on 18 hour road trips and it has been a dream to ride in it s very comfortable whether you are the driver or the passenger  In my opinion  the person who would get the most pleasure from buying this vehicle is someone who wants a really good dependable car possibly with a family that doesn t want to buy a van or larger vehicle  It would also be perfect for a person who does a lot of travelling via automobile  For families with more than 2 children I would not suggest this car for them because the back seat would be too snug especially if your children are using car seats or booster seats br br
