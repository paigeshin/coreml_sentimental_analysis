 The Mustang coupe in premium trim offers a lot for a low price  Present  3k rebates make the car a steal at about  17K  Philosophy moment  Owning a proud American car takes a bit of self esteem  The Camry conformity group will try to co depend you into their faceless society of stellar reliability  It is too dull a life for the expressive and passionate driver Key attributes 193 horsepower  225 ft lbs of torque 225 55 R 16 tires 5 spd with traction control 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS Mach 460 6 disc CD changer 6 way power driver seat Leather wrapped tilt steering wheel From the list above  it is clear you get a lot for your money in the Mustang Coupe Premium  Further  the trim and badging are tasteful  subtle  and true to the Mustang images so familiar to most Americans  Handling is predictable and mild mannered in dry conditions  The goodyear eagle LS tires are surprisingly squeal resistant  This allows pushing the limits without attracting much attention  The brakes are decent  but not on par with Ford s SVT vehicles  They will stop the car  but are not made for the abuse a racing car might see The powertrain  3 8L V6 with 5 speed  is flexible and torquey  As the rpms build past 3500  so does a considerable amount of horsepower  The car will chirp the tires in second and third if you are not smooth with your shifts  The car is happy to cruise at 90 to 100 MPH but is governed to 115 MPH top speed  As a long term member of the 100 MPH club  I can say that this is fast enough to pass 99 99  of the cars on the freeway For this type of vehicle  gas mileage is respectable ranging from 22 to 26 mpg on average  You can do even better on the highway with cruise control  The fit and finish is good  but some interior parts show uneven gaps between panels  There are no squeaks or rattles and the materials seems very robust  By and large  fit could improve but this year s Mustang shows Ford does care about quality  The feel of the car is extremely solid  The gear shifter feels like it is part of the transmission  it is  and the engine seems composed and strong even with the throttle wide open To be objective  there are areas for improvement  Wind noise is noticeable but not excessive  The back seat is not comfortable for adults  And  the rear live axle can occasionally make the back of the car feel a bit sloppy  These gripes withstanding  it is clear that no other car can match the Mustang s equipment  performance  and comfort levels at this price Any questions  Or  are you on your way to the Ford dealer already  Get a Mustang  It will revive your love for driving  Or get a Camry so it can steal your soul
