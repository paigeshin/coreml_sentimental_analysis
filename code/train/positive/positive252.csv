 i am sixteen years old and i have recently purchased a ford probe  i have owned this vehicle for about six months and i love it  i don t really have the cash to be buying new parts and having to fix things so this car is ideal for me  i haven t made one stop at the shop yet  I like the way that all your controls are right there  especially the turn signal  which you can easily turn on with a flick of the pinky  the back seat may be my only complaint  but being in my young years still it doesn t really come into play  the probe is quick   sporty  fairly cheap and very fun to drive
