 I bought this vehicle along with my husband  his dream truck  and fell in love with it to  I couldn t believe that I  as a woman  older one at that  could find this  97 Ford XLT pickup  so comfortable and so much fun to drive  I find the control and driving real pleasureable and exciting  The only disconcerting thing is that I have to step up into it  I m just glad that it has handles to assist  The driving is just as easy as driving my Sable which is a power steering  The XLT has 4 wheel drive when you need it and it s easy to shift it into 4 wheel drive  I would recommend this truck to anyone  It s comfortable  fun  and easy to drive  even for a 50 year old bat like myself  I wouldn t say that a young person would appreciate all of the qualities of the XLT but I guess that s why they built them  quot Ford tough quot  even for an adventerous young person
