 I needed a new car because my hyundai excel 91 had it so I decided to shop around for a nice small car with a affordable price tag I wasn t really thinking about american car because of all the negative talk I was thinking more of a Honda Accord Nissan Altima jetta So I went to the closest car place which so happens to be  quot Ford quot  so I browsed around for a bit see what I would like quot I just knew I wasn t going to see nothing I like and there it was a car I thought ford didn t make a car that stood out from the rest of their cars the  quot Focus quot This car was really different when I looked inside the window and saw the inside and saw how spacious it was for a small car so I said to myself they probably want alot for this car I looked at the ticket price and said I have to have this car  quot this is in my budget quot I love the roomy interior and easy the controls are to reach The way the seats feel is very comfortable I m not to found of the lumbar when it is lowered too low it leaves a big space it needs a little more horsepower though It rides nicely on the streets but rough going up a steep hill it s very comforting driving a long ride when the seat is up it makes you feel on the same level of a  quot SUV quot  This is certainly a great economical car I think anybody who is looking for a small affordable car with a midsize car feel once you sit inside you will love the car br br
