 I ve owned 5 cars in my lifetime now  and I can honestly say that this is the most comfortable commuter car of all  I commute around 150 miles each day and now have 125 000 miles on this car  And yet the only thing I ve had to replace is the alternator  battery  tires and the windshield wiper mechanism  This is a solid car with the highest safety rating possible with my insurance company  As an added bonus  it seats 6  while you d be hard pressed to find a car that does that these days If I had to complain  though I don t want to  it would have to be about this unexplicable  quot popping quot  sound while making turns  This has only happened occasionally  and it s occured since the first day I ve owned the car  I m willing to bet that this is a flaw of this particular car s design  rather than reflecting a flaw on the entire series  I have had it checked out several times and no one seems to be able to fix it or even tell me what it is  It hasn t caused me any problems though except mild bewilderment  I owned a 1990 Cutlass Calais before this car  Although they were both excellent vehicles  I d have to say that I like the style and comfort of the Taurus better  I would recommend a 97 or older Taurus to anyone and everyone  I bought it used with 24 000 miles on it  for  15 000  minus  5 000 from the trade in on the Cutlass  when I started college  hoping it would last until I graduated  I am starting my senior year this fall  I have 131 000 miles on it and no major problems yet
