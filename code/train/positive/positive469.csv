 After several MB s  two different sets of Jaguars  yes  one to drive and one to leave at the shop  Audis  mine never self propelled  and other brands too numerous to mention  both foreign and domestic  I have to admit I ve never had more fun or comfort that I get from my 1999 Expedition4Wd Eddie Bauer I d like it even more if the dealer could fix the AWD  which  when activated  manages to blink the  quot AWD ON quot  indicator like a turn signal  but what the heck  I ve still got 4WD Hi and Lo  so I m not really upset despite the 4 unsuccessful tries  now they say they have the right parts in stock and will repair it next time I drop by for routine service At 28 000 miles the car  truck  looks and drives like it did when it was brand new  That means  among other things  it still gets 12 mpg  And I still scrunch down in my seat when I m in indoor parking garages because the combined extra height from the 17 inch wheels and the roof rack produces a nerve jarring 6 7 quot  profile that some day may become a convertible when one of those overhead garage beams is a few inches lower than the sign at the entrance says it is  clearance on my at home garage door frame is about two inches   phew  Recommended accessory   a third seat prop bar that lets you leave the seat in while propping it up to reclaim stowage space  For  49 95 you can get one at http www knoxx com Good sound system  nice leather  good trimwork and  overall  a very comfortable ride in town and on the freeway  It s almost enough to make you believe that when Ford claims  quot Quality is job  1 quot  they mean it br br
