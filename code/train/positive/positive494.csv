 The Escape is Ford s entry in the popular mini SUV class of automobiles  It competes with the Nissan Xterra  Honda CRV  Toyota RAV4 and a few other SUVs  I think Ford has a good thing on its hands and  with a few minor changes  the Escape could be a category leader Exterior  the Escape is the best looking car in its class  It doesn t try to be too adventurous or too athletic  like the XTerra with its spoilers and front grills  and yet doesn t look to docile  like the CRV  Not surprisingly  the Escape looks a lot like an Explorer  albeit one with updated and refreshed lines  One element that can be improved on the exterior of the Escape is the side view mirrors  which shake at highway speeds due to the wind and don t provide a good view of other cars Interior  the interior of the Escape is generally well thought out  The radio and climate control controls are easy to use and located high up on the middle console  The column mounted gear shifter  however  was placed in an awkward position  It does not shift very well and it obscures a portion of the radio  A better solution would be to place the shifter in between the front passengers like most other SUVs  The materials used in the interior could also be improved  The dashboard and doors use cheap looking plastic and the seats are covered by a rough fabric Driving  the Escape s strongest selling point is its drivability  The Escape simply drives as well as any good car  which means that it drives better than most SUVs  The Escape s steering is very linear and direct and the SUV benefits from having a short wheelbase  I was able to maneuver the Escape in busy Seattle highway traffic with ease  The large windows and upright seating position also allows for good visibility  The V6 engine  with 201 hp  provides a lot of power and torque for a car of this size and I was able to accelerate easily in all situations  The main detraction from the driving experience relates to the immense amount of noise that emanates from the road and the engine  The car is so loud on some roads that I had to turn the radio up  Ford should consider fitting the Escape with different tires and more sound deadening material for a quieter ride Overall  the Escape is a reasonably priced small SUV that drives more like a car than a truck and seems built from one solid piece  If Ford improves the quality of the interior  including a redesign of the shifter  and makes the Escape quieter  this SUV will set sales records
