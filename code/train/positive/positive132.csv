 I wanted a Ford Mustang Convertible for years  ever since I got my driver s license  When the 95 model came out  I thought it was the most beautiful car on wheels  that I could afford  of course  It had a powerful V8 engine  gorgeous design lines  leather interior  an automatic top so I wouldn t have to wrestle with folding and unfolding some unwieldy thing  it had a glass window in the back  with defroster  so it wouldn t get scratched like a plastic one  It also had a back seat  so I could pack friends or stuff  It was my dream car  I kept it cherry with weekly detailing In 1999 I totalled my dream car because the combination of the huge  high performance 17 quot  tires  and the powerful V8 engine  although a blast to drive on dry pavement  were a disaster in wet weather  I was going below freeway speeds when I hydroplaned  spun out and hit the center divider twice  The air bags deployed perfectly  and although I had to get out and run from the dead car to avoid being hit by oncoming traffic  I was virtually uninjured  Both the front and the back end of the car were smashed and twisted and virtually gone  But I had no trouble opening the door in a hurry  And not only did the airbags save my life  they prevented injury  I had had the car for four years and it didn t have a scratch  Now it was gone  But I was alive I read later  in Consumer Reports  that many people have had similar experiences with the Mustang big tires big engine in wet weather  But that did not deter me from wanting to get another one  It was still the only car for me But the 99 model is ugly  Its lines are no longer powerful  sleek and lovely  but sharp  angular  overly aggressive and masculine  I ve looked at it and looked at it and the design is just repulsive  It s still a Mustang  it s still a great car  but it cannot compare to the look of my 95  I am dismayed that the designers at Ford are again on the downhill slide with the Mustang  In my opinion  the Mustang of the 70 s and 80 s was one sad looking underdeveloped machine  a far cry from the hot  innovative little pony car of its beginning  I hope that the Mustang of the new millennium will not share that fate  Go back to the drawing board  guys   and make it beautiful again  You can make it powerful and hot looking without making it look like a shark  Start with your 94 96 models  I still haven t bought a new car  and the money s burning a hole in my pocket  and I m itchin to feel again the way that car made me feel br br
