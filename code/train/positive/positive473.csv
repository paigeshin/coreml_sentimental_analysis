 I absolutely love my 2000 Ford Focus wagon  I bought it because my old car died and I really wanted an SUV  but could not stomach paying almost  2 00 per gallon of gas to fill one up all the time  Or for that matter  higher insurance premiums  This car gets 32 mpg on the highway  I needed room in my car for our mountain bikes  Surprise  It comes  not an option  with an adjustable roof rack that was extremely easy to outfit with two bike racks  There is nothing I don t like about this car  however an all wheel drive option would be great because I do take it on dirt roads  All the better to access trailheads  It is a blast to drive  handles wonderfully  and has alot more power than I expected out of a four cylinder car  Very zippy  I did get the ZETEC engine  so it has a little more power than the standard engine  I recommend this car for anyone considering an SUV but who may   and shouldn t we all  have reservations about their environmental impact  Less emissions  less gas  And really now  how often do you take that 4x4 SUV off road  People who should not buy this car are those of you who follow the adage  quot Bigger is Better quot  I have all the room I need  Even if we do have kids in a year or so br br
