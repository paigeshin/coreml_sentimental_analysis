 What can I say other than WOW  This really is one of the greatest vehicles on the market today  The Ford Explorer has great handling and rides very smoothly  The inner portion of the Explorer has more than plenty of room to allow you to drive with the utmost comfort  I would definately recommend this vehicle to anyone  The Ford Explorer is a highly reliable SUV sport utility vehicle  The only downside that this vehicle has is that it eats gas  but then again what SUV doesn t  I would also recommend the Expedition and the Explorer Sport as highly efficient vehicles  If you are a person who just absolutely loves sport utility vehicles  then this is the one for you br br
