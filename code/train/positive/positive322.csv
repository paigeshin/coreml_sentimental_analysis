  I bought another  used 1999  Crown Vic with the insurance settlement after my first  a used 1997  was totaled  The car was T boned at the front quarter panel by a driver on drugs  who plowed a  78 Trans Am at 50 mph through a stop sign  The air bags did deploy  See http www stormeyes org tornado nt000117 jpg for details p Though the car was knocked well off the roadway and totaled  my family and I escaped with only scrapes  scratches and a minor concussion  from the air bag impact  That was a high speed  side impact collision  folks  more than testament enough to the safety of this car  Its use in police and taxi fleets was convincing enough already regarding the Crown Vic s durability  but now  as long as Ford makes the Crown Vic with body on frame construction  I will not buy another make and model p The vehicle is a little over four years old as of this writing  and I have used it very heavily  101 000 miles of mainly highway driving in sometimes dreadful conditions  I am a storm chaser  and have equipped the car with a custom electronics rack that holds equipment very steady in such a stable  smooth riding vehicle   This car has been through severe wind  sand storms  large hail  day after day of 100 degree heat  subzero temperatures  deep mud  blizzards  and once  standing muddy water higher than the door bottoms  all with no mechanical breakdowns or major problems  It just passed its first tune up with flying colors   I cannot imagine a more comfortable car in which to travel hundreds upon hundreds of miles per day  Its top caliber suspension makes even notoriously rough Oklahoma and South Dakota back roads tolerable  and on a smooth interstate  it s hard to tell from feel alone that the car is moving at all  The Crown Vic has an SUV s weight  but with a far lower center of gravity   making it amazingly stable in intense crosswind  It also is 5 10 mpg more fuel efficient than most medium to large SUVs  Unless one  needs and frequently uses  4WD  who does  really  a used  late model Crown Vic should be given strong consideration as a primary family car p There is no more spacious trunk in the world of sedans  My friend  jokingly  suggested I could stuff six bodies in there with room to spare  Seriously  I have a Gall s police trunk organizer in the bottom  and there still is room for a long vacation s worth of luggage for a family of four plus groceries  Although towing  officially  is passe  I pull a 17 ft Bass Tracker with no problems   There are some minor problems which I can tolerate for the sake of room and safety  The LX models  which I have had  could use more power  My car just cannot accelerate up hills very well  Fortunately there is an option here that doesn t involve expensive retrofitting  Used car buyers should consider Crown Vic Interceptors equipped with the police package  dual exhaust  for best results  Also  my paint on the doors and front panels began to chip and peel in small spots at around 80 000 miles  revealing the white primer beneath  Maybe that is related to the extreme conditions I have driven it through  but a truly well done paint job should endure far worse for far longer
