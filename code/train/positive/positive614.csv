 I recently purchased a 1998 Ford Escort Station Wagon  I can t tell you how much I love it  I drive almost 70 miles per day  5 days a week  That car just keeps going and going  I am getting roughly 32 miles to the gallon so I certainly can t complain about that The interior is comfortable  almost like a luxury car  There is plenty of room for all the people you want to bring along  the dog  cats  luggage  anything that you want to go with you  The maintenance on this car is virtually non existent  The tires are the kind where you can buy them most anywhere in stock and they are not that expensive I have AC  a really good stereo system  rear wiper and sprayer  keyless entry on the back and the drivers side door  Of course it has roll down windows  but that is one less thing that can go wrong when you have the electric ones  The brakes are power which I prefer  not the ABS which I can t seem to get used to when I drive my husband s car All in all  I am very pleased with this car  It has plenty of power  speeds along especially on the highway where I do most of my driving  It is a beautiful Sable Green color and is a very attractive wagon  Also have a roof rack for any extras  I love this wagon  If you would be in the market for a wagon  check these out  I am just disappointed that they don t make these anymore
