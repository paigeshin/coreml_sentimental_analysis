 We bought a big  beat up truck so that no one  ever again  drove into me in my little car  It worked  This is the best car I have ever owned b WHY WE BOUGHT THIS CAR  When we moved to NY from South Africa in 1998 we bought a small  zippy Hyundai Accent  In the first three months of driving  six  people literally just drove into us  Either they didn t see my little car  or they thought they were bigger so didn t care whether I got out of the way  Since I was driving with my little son in the car we decided to buy the  biggest  thing we could afford  which turned out to be a 1989 Ford Bronco XLT  It has a bull bar on the front  a tow bar on the back and metal steps on both sides  It is rusty and dented  and since we got it I don t think I have been cut off in the traffic once b DRIVING AND MAINTENANCE  On the sensible side  we get a tune up once a year  and the engine runs like a dream  It feels safe and solid up to about 65mph  but I try to be a little careful about cornering  It accelerates like the wind  I had to replace the alternator  but otherwise I haven t had any breakdowns in 2 years  Lots of small  irritating things have had to be fixed  like the door hinges  the doors wouldn t stay open  the wiring for the back power window and a side window  and the interior light  That s just because it s old  I guess  Generally all the repairs have been really cheap  we replaced part of the exhaust on the Hyundai  just the part was over  200  the same piece on the Bronco was  19 I strongly believe that in any accident my family will be better off in this car than just about any other  particularly in our price range  All in all this truck is a joy to drive  and I must admit I rather like the image too  br br
