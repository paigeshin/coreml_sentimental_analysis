 In a time when SUVs are getting bigger and bigger  Excursion  Suburban  etc  the Ford Explorer Sport stands out as a quality vehicle  not only relative to size  but also overall  It is loaded to the gills with features  with the top of the line models still costing less than  30 000  This car is available in manual  or for just an extra thousand dollars  automatic  It packs a huge V 6 standard  or an optional V 8 under its tiny hood  Because of a shorter wheelbase  all this power is very easy to control  Even with the two door design  there is still room for two passengers to sit comfortably in the back seat  which can be folded down to accommodate skis or other large packages  This car is a great winter vehicle  but if you want to go skiing in it  you may run into problems trying to store longer skis in the back  However  the car is short enough that one can easily access a ski rack on the roof  This another benefit of the Sport over other SUV behemoths on the road today  On the inside  various packages can get you a high end MACH Audio system with a six disc CD changer  Even without this  the second level stereo still has AM FM  cassette deck  and a single CD player  There are several auxilery powerpoints for numerous electronics  It comes with standard AC and heat  both in the front and back seats  There is an extra power door lock by the back gate  so that you can lock the doors after taking stuff out of the back  The car has great handling for an SUV  due to its smaller size  The four wheel drive is easy to use  and results in very little loss of control  This is a great winter car  especially for a young driver  which is the type of person that I would strongly recommend this car for  It handles well in tough conditions  which is very helpful  plus it is not too large  and it is very affordable  So  if you are looking into a 4x4 for a new driver  or buying your first  I would definitely recommend the Explorer Sport
