 I LOVE my Ford Explorer  As I sat in many a traffic jam in my tiny little aging economy car  I longed at the Explorers that sat in my view  Considering my situation  newly married and planning a family  in a professional job  having hobbies including skeet shooting  woodworking  and other things that would require some cargo space  I felt that the Explorer would be an excellent car for me The best things about the care in my opinion are being up high  looking sharp  and having an excellent balance between cargo space and passenger space  I am no longer ashamed to drive my bosses around  but I can still haul a big pile of wood and tools from Home Depot when I get the urge to try that  weekend  woodworking project  or help my friends fix up their homes  The safety features of the Explorer are also a plus  My wife used to cringe at the thought of me driving around in my little Sentra that had no airbags  let alone crumple zones or reinforced doors  It is very comforting to have a safe car I can t say that I m totally without complaints  but I have learned to live with the few I have about the Explorer  Okay  so it is a bit bouncy  it s a truck  it s supposed to be bouncy  If I wanted a smooth ride  I would ve bought something lower to the ground  And note that I say  bouncy  not bumpy  Though you do bounce up and down over a speedbump or a bump in the road  you are not being racked around like a rock in a tumbler  Its more smooth  like a waterbed  Another thing is that it gets really poor gas mileage  Again  good gas mileage is for Honda Accords and Toyota Corollas  The trade off is worth it to me  If I have to fill up a little more often  it s worth the power and space I have  and the tank is 20gal  so it does last a while  even with the poor mileage Other than the bouncy problem  driving the explorer is like a dream  It handles very well  stops nice  and has enough power to get you around that 18 wheeler that is weaving from side to side  and it is very  very quiet If you have the means and are ready to move into the SUV class  I would recommend an explorer  If you want good gas mileage and a smoother ride  you might want to look at one of the smaller SUVs from those manufacturers that make the high gas mileage economy cars  And if you want a smoother ride  you ll probably have to dish out a few thousand extra bucks and go for one of those luxury manufacturer SUVs  But if you just want a good solid  American  made car  though I d venture to guess that few cars are completely made in America today  that gives you the best features of a passenger car with the versatility of a pickup  I d go for the Explorer br br
