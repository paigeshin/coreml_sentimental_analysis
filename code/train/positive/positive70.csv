 The sporty appearance is unmatched  The interior w comfort convenience group  rivals that of a limo  When inside the vehicle the interior lighting and optional leather interior create an atmosphere of comfort and luxury The stereo system performs well with a 6 disc changer as optional  The third seat area is a bit hard to access and not made for very tall people but is adequate  Removing the seat is a snap for extra storage space  It will also tip up for extra space in the cargo area  I have owned a Mustang and in my opinion the handling of the Expedition considering it s size  is comparable  The optional 5 4L V8 has tremendous power  The acceleration is scary for such a large vehicle  Both from a dead stop and while passing the performance is awe inspiring  Road noise is minimal  Shopping around and using dealer against dealer will save you 3 5K off of MSRP  Overall a great vehicle 9 out of 10 in my opinion
