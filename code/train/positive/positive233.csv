 My wife was looking for an SUV a couple of years ago and I talked her into a mini van  We picked out a 95 Windstar because it had everything we wanted  V6 engine to pull a camper  seats seven  extra cargo space and a reasonable price used  Our Van had 34 000 miles when we purchased it  We now have 74 000 miles and had a number of minor and major problems  Luckily we purchased an extended warranty and have not had to fork out too much cash The computer had to be replaced at about 52 000 miles  covered under extended warranty The head gasket had to be replaced at about 56 000 miles  covered by Ford due to a faulty gasket problem The front tie rod had to be replaced at 68 000 miles  covered under extended warranty The engine had to be replaced at 73 000 miles  covered by Ford for the same problem as the head gasket  A note to all Windstar owners  Ford will replace your engine up to 100 000 miles or reimburse you if you already had your head gasket replaced or your engine replaced After comparing problems with a friend of mine  I was alerted to a transmission problem and a break problem with the 95 Windstars  I have not had any problems with the brakes or transmission  but if I do  I hope they come before my extended warranty expires Got it back from shop with the new engine and now the transmission fluid is leaking  I finally got it back to the Ford Dealer and he said it was the seal at the torque converter  Another  50 on my extended warranty Other then these mechanical problems  we do like our Windstar  It s roomy  comfortable  easy to drive  We pull a pop up trailer with it  but you cannot find air shocks for the Windstar  so all you can really get is heavy duty shocks to pull a trailer  The v6 3 8L does fine pulling the trailer  but eats a lot of gas  The Windstar has the cargo capacity of an extended Dodge Caravan  This helps on grocery day or for trips I would not recommend an older model Windstar  but I would hope the newer models have all the bugs worked out  For all you older model owners  cross your fingers and save your pennies  repairs could be in your future David Since writing this opinion I had a sensor for the EGR valve go bad which cost  134 to fix and It was covered on my extended warranty So far I have had  1800 worth of work done using my extended warranty  The  900 I paid for the warranty was money well spent  That doesn t even include the head gasket and engine rebuild that Ford paid to fix br br
