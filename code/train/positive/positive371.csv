 As a busy mother with two children and always on the go  I live in my car  it is like my second home  I have to be able to keep things in my car  quot just in case quot  when I am away from the home  My Expedition is big enough for me to do that without being  quot TOO BULKY quot  and still look good We have been looking at the Expedition since it first came out  We finally purchased one this past month  We looked at all the comparable SUV s but we felt the Expedition always came out ahead  It was big but not too big  We had the features of the larger SUV  suburban  excursion  without the bulk and still the sporty look of the smaller SUV  Driving this vehicle makes me feel safe with the kids THAT S IMPORTANT It drives smooth  sturdy  and strong  I don t feel as if I am going to be blown over by the wind  If you are a busy mom that needs a reliable vehicle with lots of room yet doesn t look like a bus  this car is perfect for you unless of course you don t like driving big vehicles   br br
