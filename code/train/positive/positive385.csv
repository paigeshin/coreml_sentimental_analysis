 Ok  right off I love this truck  We bought the  97 Ford F 150 XLT shortbed  standard cab truck  and it was definitly worth buying  The price was very reasonable for the great quality we received It was used but the milage on it was very low  and the warranty had been extended for us for the term of the financing    Big Plus   It came with A C  ABS  both driver and passenger airbags  and another plus is that the passenger side airbag can be turned off    great if you have to fasten a car seat in the truck    We have had the truck almost a year now and it has been outstanding  No major issues at all  Because it is a truck it would not be good for families because of the lack of room  but this is an excellent work truck  Even on long road trips the seats are very comfortable  Driving it is a real pleasure  very responsive and handles well You want a good truck  go with the Ford F 150 br br
