 Well  my parents bought a red Windstar from a dealer that buys autos at auctions and such  and we got it about as brand new as a used car could be  it had about 1 6k on it  and had barely been considered used by the dealer  So we got it for about  4 000 off  and I think my parents got it for about 16 000 in 1996  There is plenty of legroom for everyone  and a space perfect for a cooler right next to the sliding door  which came in handy when we went down to see the Huskies in the 2001 Rose Bowl recently   Go Dawgs I recommend this vehicle to any family that wants a good versatile van that has some power  V6 is pretty impressive for a minivan and has room for all passengers
