 I grew up worshiping the quality of Japanese  German and Swedish cars  but I have to admit  my last few years driving this very inexpensive Ford have convinced me to consider another one the next time I need a new car  While it isn t much to look at  it has been immensely practical and reliable  I inherited this vehicle from my parents  and as a poor college student at the time I couldn t say no  despite its  quot grocery getter quot  nature  Now that I own a house  commute 20 miles to work in heavy traffic  and park in cramped lots  I appreciate its sizable cargo space  good gas mileage  and nimble handling  I recently recommended it to a friend and I recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for this type of vehicle  it is small and agile  with an excellent turning radius  it gets about 35mpg on mixed driving  can haul a lot more than you would think  and it s very reliable  Mine has 119k miles with only minimal maintenance  new belts and an alternator at 100k  and oil every 3 5k  It is a small car with a small engine  1 9L  so don t expect to outrun anyone  but it does have enough pickup for a normal driving  even in the aggressive Washington  DC traffic  The biggest problem  it s a station wagon and it looks like it  If you can swallow your pride  you ll save a lot of money with car br br
