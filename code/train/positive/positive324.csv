 We need to start with the model I own  The XLT with Appearance Package  Several of my comments relate to features found in this model  The premium sound system  not the Mach system  lacks low end bass  I fixed that with an add on sub  The good point being that the receiver is capable  it s just the amp that is lacking  The cargo area needs a net and some hooks to keep things in place  My biggest gripe is that the cargo area does not come with a cover and there is no aftermarket ones available  I fault Ford for not adding two little pieces of plastic into the sides that would have allowed me to add one  This is coming from someone who has had their vehicle broken into because of what was visible in the cargo area  I got the 5 4 V8 and it gets about 12 MPG  My comment here is don t kid yourself  if you don t like paying for gas  then this is not the vehicle for you  My particular model has some unique 17  factory rims  Something is not right because my wheels require balancing every 5000 miles  My tire place tells me that the wheels are designed so that it is hard for balancing weights to stay on  This is not normal but I like the distinct look of the wheels  The AWD system is not the best in the world producing noticeable slippage in snow  However  Ford compensated for this by adding in the unusual option of allowing a 4WD mode  The 4WD mode is superb in the white stuff  This being my 6th AWD 4WD vehicle  I prefer 4WD in snow  I refer you to the motto  Transfers power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip  The key point is that some slipping must be going on  When this is done well  see my epinion on the Subaru Outback  then you don t notice  in the Expedition s case  it is not done well  but the 4wd mode compensates  The 3rd row seat  while improved over previous years  is still a pain in the butt to get in and out  It is heavy and bulky and I always strain my back dealing with it  Yes  the manual says use two people  but I don t happen to have an official seat moving helper on staff at the moment  No normal feature of a car should require two people to use it  They tried to compensate by allowing the seat to be folded into a shelf or tilted up  Both of these features are nothing more than marketing  The tilted up seat does not provide that much more room  The folded down shelf is useless because anything placed on the self slides right off  The new line of GM full size SUVS seems to have dealt properly with this feature by allowing two separate seats  I tend to keep my seat removed and only put it back in when I have a lot of people to move  The vehicle definitely looks cooler with it out  Now on to the many  many good points Design Room  Room  Room  I am 6 4  and no part of this vehicle comes even close to any part of me  shoulders  head  etc  Good use of room  In checking out the wildly popular line of Chrysler minivans  I found roomy vehicles  but a lot of wasted room  Not so with the Expedition  The console is fantastic  the cup holders LARGE  and enough little storage areas to please a pack rat  I would ask for more storage in the cargo area though  If you ve done your research  you know that there is 4 feet between the wheel wells allowing for sheets of building materials  Everything seems to be solid  no thin plastic parts  check out the console on a Blazer for an example of cheap plastic parts  The steering wheel is large and cushioned and feels good in your hands  I really like the CD changer being accessible in the center console yet still having plenty of room left for stuff  try that with a smaller car  The controls are standard Ford  3 rotary dials for climate  cruise control on the steering wheel  and minimal usage of steering wheel stalks  This being my third Ford  I like my controls predictable  so I am very happy with the interior ergonomics The rear cargo area is cavernous and the pull down handle on the rear door is nice  The step up bumper allows easy access should you need to actually get in the cargo area The Appearance Package provides step bars instead of running boards  Being tall  I don t like any step up features at all  considering them to be a wuss feature  however  the women in my life all consider this to the best feature of the truck  go figure  Personally  I have to be careful or they get my pant legs dirty  There are grab handles for all 4 outboard passengers  Mechanicals The ride and power is comparable to other SUVs  Remember I have the 5 4  In test drives I found the 4 6 to be underpowered  which is not true for the F150 Pickup  One interesting note is that there seems to be so much power and low end torque that extra weight in the car seems to have little effect  I have had 800 lbs of passengers and could not tell from the way the vehicle handled and accelerated  The handling is great for something so large and the ride is exceptionally smooth for what is essentially a dressed up pickup  The anti lock brakes are better than the average  It comes with massive 4 wheel disks and does a good job stopping quick   The electronic AWD 4WD works perfectly and is easy to use and understand although it is a little close to the ventilation knob  both in distance and shape  While I feel that this vehicle is tough enough to take off road  see my Subaru Outback epinion  I found the suspension to be a little spongy for off roading  When combined with the tremendous weight of this thing  I suggest keeping it on the pavement  In all fairness I have taken some roadway dips at higher speeds and never actually bottomed out  This might all be a perception thing on my part  Seating The front seats are comfortable for longer drives  The second row seat allow 3 adults to sit without touching one another or the seat backs in front of them  The 3rd row seat is good for smaller people  I have had kids back there and they actually enjoy it  kind of like riding in the back of the station wagon when you were a kid In 14 months of ownership I have not had a single problem  The quality of this vehicle is truly first rate All in all this is one fantastic vehicle and I will probably buy another one in a few years
