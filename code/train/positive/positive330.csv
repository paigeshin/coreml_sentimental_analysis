 This review comes about mostly as a rebuttal to my wife who insists on comparing her car  a 1995 Honda Civic DX  to mine  1993 Ford Escort GT Let us take a look at the individual parts and then the Gestalt whole  shall we ENGINE  9 Possibly the strongest reason for buying the car  Mazda s 1 8L DOHC pushes out 127 hp  and it does so pretty effortlessly  Willing to rev  the secret formula is that the engine feels so strong because the car is so darn light  When new  the published 0 60 times on this car were in the high 7s  low 8 second region  That was faster than many cars twice its size  mostly because they were twice its size  This allowed me to surprise many Taurus  Olds Cutlass and Chevy Lumina owners at stoplights  The only problem I have is that the car is geared relatively low for quick acceleration  and so cruising at 75mph it is turning between a fairly noisy 3500 4000 rpm  The upside to this is if you mash the pedal even at 80mph  the engine is right in the sweet spot of the torque curve and surges forward nicely HANDLING  8 Again  excellent in a car so priced  The car feels light and tossable in corners  yet tracks straight at speed  Stiff spring and shock rates coupled with wide tires make this thing hang on tenaciously in turns  There is one large BEWARE  however  Lift throttle induced oversteer can be extreme when cornering hard  I personally enjoy it because I can flick the tail out easily when I m in the mood  but to the novice or inattentive  watch out  My wife was driving with me in the rain about 8 weeks after I bought my baby  and she let off the gas mid turn on a wide sweeper and the tail came right around  sending us grinding across a low stone wall  taking out the entire undercarriage  almost  9K damage  The dealership did a bang up job of putting it back together and it has tracked straight as an arrow ever since RIDE  6 The stiffness that makes for such good handling translates into so so ride comfort  A little tire noise and bounciness over bumps is tolerable The lightness comes at the expense of not having much sound deadening insulation  I do have to say I have gone through 3 sets of brake pads  but I drive pretty hard  and this may be normal wear for 146K miles  I also seem to go through tires pretty fast  which may also have to do with my relatively aggressive style  sidenote  OEM tire size is 185 60R15  and the ONLY tire made in that size is the OEM Goodyear Eagle GT 4  which are expensive  99 apiece  My solution after 100K miles was to switch up safely to 195 60 s which are available in more and cheaper brands TRANSMISSION  8 Shifts just fine  not crisp but not sloppy  even after 146 000 miles  never been replaced  original clutch  effort is light  The only thing I wish I had was a quick little wrist shifting car like a Miata or Toyota MR2  The throw on the GT is not nearly as long as on my old 84 EXP  but it s not as short as I d like EXTERIOR  8 My wife will argue this to death with me  but I still think it looks sporty  I first fell for this car in it s 91 92 Iris package trim  with the alloy wheels that matched the car s paint color  I ended up with the silver alloy wheels  and I think they look even better  It s no  vette  but it still looks better than a Tercel or Corolla  or even my wife s Civic anyday INTERIOR  7 OK  this is not a luxury car by any stretch of the imagination  First of all  the GT comes with virtually nothing power  no power windows  locks  seats  airbags  etc  The logic behind this is that all of those things add weight  which would slow the car down  The interior is sparse  the cupholders good  dash has usable space  plastic is hard  not great but not tacky either  The controls are intuitive and well placed  none have ever broken on me  The stereo is good  though again its speakers are odd sizes that are only slightly more difficult to replace with aftermarket than usual  The A C is ICE cold  still a good freon system  not the lukewarm R134a system my wife has in hers  The seats are comfortable for me  but in all honesty not the greatest for long hauls  but the side bolstering is good and adjustments are easy  with a lot of room if you re tall and up closeness if you re short  The one feature that I am continually AMAZED at is the amount of cargo space I have if I fold the rear seats and load from the hatchback  This car is cavernous  I haul to the dump  carry lumber  have moved twice with it  it just has a ton of room for such a small car RELIABILITY MAINTENANCE  10 So far  this is where my baby has shined  My wife talks on and on about her Civic s superior quality  but here is a stone cold fact  my car has virtually no repair history to speak of  No kidding  And this car has 146 000 miles on it  Replaced the timing belt at 100K  the 90 degree elbow off the exhaust manifold finally rusted through 6 months ago  I replaced it  but the all stainless pipes from the flex pipe back is all original  I mentioned tires and brakes going quickly due to my driving habits  No tranny clutch problems  a LITTLE tiny bit of oil leakage finally the last few months  what do you expect after almost 150K   all original hoses  belts  brake lines  master cylinder  suspension  cables  etc  The A C compressor just went on me this week  July 2000  and will need replacing  I put new plug wires on it 5 yrs ago  and I think I had one small leak  quickly sealed  around the rear window when I first got it  One small niggling problem  I feel like I have replaced a lot of headlights and foglights  but what is that   10 or so for a bulb  All in all  for 150 000 miles I have had nothing but trouble free driving pleasure from this car  and isn t that what it s all about OVERALL  Well  tallying it up  it looks like the average score for my little pocket rocket is solid 8 0  even though she s a 10 in my heart  For the money  some of the cheapest fun you can have on the road  Good looks  great performance  solid reliability  tough to beat in its class  What a package br br
