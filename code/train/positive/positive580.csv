 If you Love Quality  and You Love Comfort  This is the Vehicle for you It s not only sporty but it has many luxuries to go along with it I don t personally own this vehicle  but I had it for about a month  It was my bosses  I used to have to drive him around and things like that  The particular Explorer that he had was a 1996 with the Eddie Bauer package  What a nice truck  It had leather interior  4 WD  the handling of it was excellent  I d driven through some snowy messes that I know I would have never made it through with my car  and that truck just went through it like it was nothing  This truck also got great gas milage  I can t really give exact numbers right now  I don t remember  But I do know that for the amount of driving that I had done  it didn t take as much gas as I had thought it would  No different than what my car takes  It handles well on the highway  or over rugged mountain roads  Either way you go  you have great control  Another feature I liked about this truck was the fact that it told you in digital numbers what the temperature was outside  what direction you were going and everything  It tells you how soon you need to refuel  when you need your next oil change etc  For instance say you put in 20 gallons of gasoline  You drive a little while and look at the meter  it will tell you that you have 15 gallons left  Great idea Ford  I like that  Power windows  power locks  combination lock on the door  if you forget your key  All great features of this wonderful truck  As for cons  I never found any  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a sporty vehicle  but yet solid  safe and sound  If you don t know if you d want to own one  just go test drive one someday  You ll see what I m talking about br br
