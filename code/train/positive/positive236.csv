 We bought a 95 Windstar about 4 months after they came out in April of 94  We had owned two Aerostars previously  I loved driving it  We made alot trips in it and it never left me on the side of road  We had our first problem with the sliding door  The sensors would go off and the chimes would start  Took it back several times but could not find a problem with it  They even tried adjusting the door We finally figured out the problem  if you get the contacts wet or they are dirty even just a little then that will set the chimes off and turn the interior lights on  WE didn t have any more problems until a trip to Phoenix and the check engine light came on  Took it in and is was an oxogen sensor  Had to have the brakes done at 30000 miles IT took four times to get it right  I blame that on the dealer  We had finally payed it off this past September and thought we would be without a car payment for a couple of years  Wrong In December with 69 000 miles on it the transmission was acting up  It would not shift into first gear after stopping  Xmas was not the time to give me problems with an upcoming trip home for the holidays  We decided to trade it in and buy a bigger vehicle  For the most part it was a good van it served its purpose while we had it  IT was getting small for since we have teenage boys and they are all over 6 feet tall  I liked the ride better than the Caravan  The seats were alot more comfy  I would recommend this van to families  Overall it really never let us down until the end br br
