 My best friend had just recently purchased a Ford ZX2  When I found out that he had traded his Camaro for this small gas saver I was greatly disappointed in him  But my opinion changed when he was telling me about how little it cost him and how great it was on gas I was starting to get interested  He invited me for a ride in his new car and I accepted  As soon as I sat in the comfortable seat i fell in love  For a small car it rode like it was at least  20 000 with a 6 cylinder motor under the hood  But that was just the beginning  We drove for about a half an hour and i was surprised when he asked me if I wanted to drive it  I accepted in an instant  I got behind the wheel  and off we were  The ZX2 is such a blast to drive  and the handling is outstanding  Maneuvering through traffic is no problem with this peppy little four banger  What I like the most about this car is its ability to get up to speed quickly  its comfortable and sporty interior  and its dual airbags make this a safe  dependable  low maintenence car for anyone who wants to save money and have something sporty at the same time  I highly recommend going to the dealer and at least taking one of these for a test drive
