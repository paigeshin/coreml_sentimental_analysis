 Well  not a whole lot  to be honest  I ve always driven trucks or SUV s  and I was very reluctant about buying a car  You see  I m very short  This may sound unrelated  but I m just over 5 feet tall  and I never really liked the idea of being so close to the ground while I drove  Whenever I was forced to drive a car when my car was in the shop or being used by someone else  I always felt like I was driving a go cart So  when I recently decided to trade in my Explorer for something more fuel efficient  I figured I d stay with Ford and go for a Taurus  I purchased the Taurus LES  the luxury model  complete with leather interior and climate control  And I have to tell you  it s been absolutely incredible  Apparently  Ford has been working on the new design for the Taurus for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 years  Although I m still closer to the ground than I d like  this model is much better than my mother s 1996 Taurus  The car rides much smoother than my Explorer ever did  and it s much more fuel efficient  So  if there is anyone out there who s been hit as hard by the gas price hike and is nervous about buying a car  I d highly recommend this beautiful  economical car
