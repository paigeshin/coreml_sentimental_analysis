 I bought the 1999 Ford LX in November of 1998  I was looking for a dependable small car with a reasonable price  I have not been disappointed with the car itself  I have 25 000 mile and it runs like a dream  I took a trip from South Dakota to Mississippi this summer  2300 miles  and was very comfortable the entire trip  The car is great  However  the service has NOT been so great after purchasing I noticed a flaw in the window molding  I reported to Ford when they did the Customer Satisfaction phone call  I was told to take to my local dealer where I had purchased the car  I was told they would fix it but could not right now  I have called a few times to see when it would be fixed and have been given no time that it can be taken care of  I am a easy person to deal with but the noise from the window may change that pretty soon  The Ford Escort is a good car for average size people I would not recommend this car for larger people  My wife is 5 2 quot  and loves the way it handles and that she can see over the steering wheel  I will purchase another Ford in the future IF the follow up service is improved
