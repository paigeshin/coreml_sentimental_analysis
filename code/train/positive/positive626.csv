 I had gotten the bug to buy a used police car so I could yank the motor and other heavy duty items out of it for a Chevy project car I attended a Texas DPS  state police  auction to see what I could get  When they started auctioning off the Chevy Caprice s at  7000  for cars with 105 000 to 110 000 miles  I knew the prices were way out of line  anybody ever seen a used cop car  carpets all ripped  stains  loose wiring bundles etc  and set my sights on a lower priced vehicle  They finally brought out the Crown Vic s  which were all from a different agency  and the prices became more reasonable  I figured I could always adapt the Ford motor to my car if need be It had actually been used by the Alcoholic Beverage Commission in Brownsville and El Paso  The back seat looked like it had never been sat in  it was that clean  Trunk was so clean it looked like it had never been used  When I went to review the maintenance records after purchase  I found out that these cars had originally been ordered with 302 s  per VIN   but had actually come with 351W with Certified Calibration speedometer  Woohoo  Anybody wanting a cop car knows what this means  Even if you don t know it s a cop car  this is usually a dead giveaway and means all heavy duty components from the factory What I have found with this car mileage  sucks  really  I usually drive around 75mph on the highway and I can watch the gas gauge drop 1 2 tank over the course of about 150 miles braking  Haven t quite experienced brake fade but it is easy to think you re braking when you really aren t and have to squeeze harder on the pedal before rear ending someone power  initial acceleration sucks  but once it is up to speed and in the power band  you can barely tap the gas and it will accelerate quickly  and once it is going and you take your foot off the gas  it will continue to coast and barely slow down As noted by some other reviewers  I am having electric window problems  One doesn t work at all and another is slipping while going up  requiring me to manually push it up  But this isn t a big deal since I am the only who rides in this vehicle At this point  rather than yank the motor for my project car  I ve decided to strip the body off and use it as a base for a kitcar  like a Shelby Cobra or something
