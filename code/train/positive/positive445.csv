 I bought my 1996 Windstar because it drove well and had plenty of room inside for my family  The next year it got five stars in the crash test ratings  When someone pulled out in front of me and I hit them going about 50 mph  the front end crumpled in the middle just like it is designed to  My two children  in the back seat  and I walked away with minor injuries  something I feel very strongly would not have happened in a smaller  or less well built car  Even though I am not a  quot mini van kind of person quot  this vehicle is great for a family  The sliding doors shut firmly  but are easy for elementary school age children to open  I am glad I got the air conditioning in the back of the van  I don t like that when you have the heater on  the air is still cool coming from the vents in the roof  I only get about 18 miles per gallon  I wish there was a console between the two front seats If I buy another mini van  it will be a Ford Windstar br br
