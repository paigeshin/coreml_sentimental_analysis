 this vehicle is safe  i love the 4 wheel drive which is almost slip thru in the weather we are having right now  driving this car is like riding a cloud  the ride is calm and not bumpy i recommend this to tall people and people who love to half some fun on the streets  the car can handle in tough situation like snow and mud the inside is roomy  the back seat is even comfortable enough to sit in  It cost is well for a vehicle this size too  the car is equiped with a A4WD  4H or 4L so u can set up your driving style  the car is also big enought to carry loads of camping stuff or boxes to work  it s acar suitable for every person a workamn or fun having person or BOTH br br
