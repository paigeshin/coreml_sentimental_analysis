 My husband  amp  I recently bought a Ford Explorer after much research  amp  study  We decided on a Sports Utility  amp  then had to decide which one  We had many times driven or been in my father in law s Ford Expedition  This was out of our price range  but we liked what it had to offer  We found that the Ford Explorer had many of those same options that we like so much in the Expedition in our price range  The Ford Explorer is the biggest SUV in it s class   It s considered to be in the small sport s utility class  We have loved our SUV ever since  One of the things that we noticed when searching for a sports utility was that some of the 2 wheel drive SUV s have rear wheel instead of front wheel drive  We decided against the Honda Passport for this very reason  The Ford Explorer 2 wheel drive does have front wheel drive  This is a very important feature if you live in a hilly or snow prone areas  If you live in California  though  it may not be that important to you The higher insurance we now have because we re driving a sports utility isn t a great feature  However  it s still comparatively lower than the insurance cost for other SUV s  Overall  the Ford Explorer is the best buy in its class
