 Greetings  What follows is a blow by blow account of a head to head comparison test of the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze  If you own or are thinking of purchasing either of these vehicles  this should prove to be very interesting reading for you  I have toned it down to about 1 300 words  in the interest of not posting a novel here on Epinions com   Earlier today  I found myself with an interesting assignment  to pick which of two cars was the  quot better quot  car  A close friend was shopping for a compact sedan  but she hated the idea of not buying American  After much discussion  mostly related to styling  she narrowed it down to two cars  the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze You see  this all began several weeks ago when my friend s car  a wheezy old 1987 Ford Mustang  was diagnosed as needing a new automatic transmission within the next month or so  The car was driveable  but definitely on the way out  Knowing that I am a  quot car guy quot  she called me up and asked me what she should buy  choosing from only compact  four door North American models that can be bought for well under  20 000  she was thinking  18 000 or less We immediately ruled out the Pontiac Grand Am as she felt the styling was simply too funky for her more conservative tastes  especially the dashboard which appears to have been lifted straight out of a sci fi movie  I actually like it myself  She also ruled out the Ford Focus  as it too struck her as a little too weird  Interestingly  she really liked the looks of the Ford Contour  She also liked the design of the Plymouth breeze  saying that is was definitely  quot neato quot  and was not too weird for her So  having effectively narrowed it down to a used Ford Contour or a Plymouth breeze  we set out in search of a prime example of each  She decided that she would probably be best off to pick up a used 1999 model of the car she chose as this would save her several thousand dollars  you know the scenario  champagne taste  Coca Cola budget So  as luck would have it  after lots of searching for a couple of really clean cars  we happened to find one of each on the same used car lot  a red 1999 Plymouth Breeze with 24 000 miles  and a white Ford Contour with 25 400 miles  Both were automatics  and had power windows  door locks  and mirrors  AM FM cassette stereos  cloth interiors  and 4 cylinder engines  We drove the Breeze first Inside  the Plymouth breeze is deceivingly roomy  There is plenty of room for four 6 foot adults to get comfortable  The back seat even features a nifty fold down and pull out dual cupholder in the back of the front armrest  The opposite was true of the Ford Contour  The back seats are tight for six footers  and rear headroom is non existent  Hitting a nice bump on the freeway would definitely result in the rear passengers bumping their heads on the roof if they were 5 9 quot  or taller  The breeze won that one hands down  It feels much larger from any seating position  even though on the outside it s almost the same size as the Contour The Breeze has the nicer looking gauge cluster  and more in the way of interior storage compartments  Of course  as is typical of Chrysler company products the interior looked and felt like it was put together on a strict  under allocated  budget  The plastics are definitely rental car grade  and the controls do feel unsubstantial and sort of rubbery On the other hand  the Contour was missing something I insist on in any car I drive  a tachometer  Even with an automatic  a tach can be very useful  especially in a car with overdrive transmission  The Contour feels smaller  both in terms of interior space and overall size  Without a doubt the plastics used on the dash are of higher quality than those found in the Breeze  The steering wheel in the Contour scored major points with me for it s thick  meaty feel  Conversely  the steering wheel in the Breeze is nothing special and is immediately forgettable Despite being direct competitors  these two cars feel very  very different  The Breeze feels more like a typical American car in that it feels large and roomy  and it handles like a small boat  Road feel is not a term with which Plymouth is well acquainted  The steering is vague and uncommunicative  leaving the driver feeling like they are driving a small Buick Conversely  the Contour  derived from the hugely successful European Ford Mondeo  offers the driver excellent road feel  For an enthusiast  this makes the drive more fun and makes the car more predictable  inspiring more spirited driving  For the average consumer the Contours excellent steering imparts a feeling of having better control over the vehicle  thus making them feel safer   This elusive trait is why BMWs are known as the  quot ultimate driving machine quot  The road feel in a BMW is quite simply the very best in the world As for power  neither car is exactly a road rocket  but thanks to its superior handling  the Contour feels both faster and much more fun to drive  In all honesty  the Ford felt faster from a standstill  although we obviously did not conduct instrumented testing  The Ford s brakes were definitely better than those in the Breeze  but bear in mind that both were used cars Surprisingly  both cars have great trunks  One would expect the Contour to have a small trunk  and while it s not as deep as that found on the Breeze  it is surprisingly large and usable  Of course  the Breeze s trunk ultimately is the larger of the two One of the biggest subjective differences between these two vehicles is the quality of materials and level of fit and finish  The Ford felt like it was put together very well  in fact  if I may be so bold  it felt downright European  Conversely  the Breeze felt like it was good for maybe another 50 00 miles before it came apart at the seams  The plastics are super cheap  and squeaks and rattles were certainly noticeable  The Breeze left us with the impression that we had driven a cheap car  while the Contour felt like a shoe string budget BMW wannabe  no kidding So  which did we choose  In case you haven t guessed yet  she bought the Contour  We both felt good about the purchase  especially since we negotiated a great deal on the car  She is thrilled  and she especially likes the styling of the Contour  When we took a good long look at it  she felt the Breeze looked like a plastic toy  especially the grill and mirrors  and I must admit that the front end of the Contour is very pleasing to look at  The cat s eye headlamps are very elegant Apparently  the Contour is one of Ford s most reliable products  Time will tell  and I must admit that I am somewhat pessimistic about its projected life span  Of course  it s not a Plymouth  I am not a fan of Chrysler products  so I definitely think she picked the better built car Overall  I was very impressed with the Ford s performance and overall packaging  except the rear seat headroom thing  I had pretty much written Ford off as a manufacturer of below average quality automobiles with little or no finesse  the new Focus excluded  A pleasant surprise  I could actually sort of envision myself driving a Ford product and actually liking it for the first time in years  of course  I would probably opt for the 6 cylinder SVT Contour All in all  the Ford struck me as the better car  I think she choose wisely  Of course  neither car would hold a candle to a used Nissan Altima  Honda Civic  or VW Jetta in my books  But hey  this car wasn t for me  My pal insisted on an American car  and I personally think she got a great set of wheels for her money   br br
