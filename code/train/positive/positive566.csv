 I love this car  You get the feel of a sports car  the handling of a sports car  the look of a sports car at a non sports car price  What more could one ask for  Standard on the car comes the one disk cdplayer  a must for anyone these days who listens to music and the sound quality on the base model still out performs most cars  When a person thinks of a two door car the first thing that comes to mind is SPACE  It is not a worry in this car  there is plenty of trunk space for those long trips  a middle console to hold anything from cds to papers and plenty of leg room for front seat passengers  This vehicle with its V 6 engine gets very good gas milage perfect for those who have long commutes to work or who just drive a lot  Speaking of V 6 this engine gives you more bang for your buck even at 80 miles an hour  it feels like 60  the car moves with you gliding along curves and passing the competition  You are in control when driving this car  This vehicle is the perfect car for college students  young professionals  retired persons alike  The only people i do not recommend this car for you people with children because of the obvious lingistics that entails  If you are looking for a car that is just right for you  try a mustang you will NOT be disappointed
