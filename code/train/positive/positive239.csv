 I have owned a lot of different vehicles over the years for various purposes including four different pickups  My most recent purchase was the Ford Power Stroke Diesel  Model year 1997  It is a F 250 XLT model Supercab with and automatic and 4 wheel drive  I have owned it for a year and the following sums up my experience with the vehicle MECHANICAL ATTRIBUTES  rating 8 out of 10  The Power Stroke has proven to be a real reliable engine with lots of low end torque while at the same time providing a fair amount of top end cruising ability  I pull a 35 foot fifth wheel trailer and have been able to climb a 4 to 5  grade and still maintain 50 miles per hour with the trailer attached  The fuel mileage is good for a working rig with a big mill 17 mpg w o the trailer on  12 w  the trailer  The trucks digs right in from a dead stop and accelerates well  even with the trailer on There two things to be wary of when considering this vehicle  One is that the transmission  I have the three speed automatic with overdrive  is weak  It can not stand to be overheated much at all and so it needs to have an auxiliary transmission cooler for any significant pulling  the mechanics I go to have recommended to me that it should have at least a  quot 3 loop quot  cooler  These same mechanics have also recommended to me that the transmission be regularly serviced at least as often as the manual recommends  and more often for any significant pulling The other thing to remember to consider is that being a Diesel  regular oil changes are a must  Changing the oil and filters are spendy considering it has a two quart filter and a fifteen quart oil capacity  However this is a minor cost considering that with regular maintenance  some of the diesel trucks have gone 500 000 miles with out a major repair BODY AND COMFORT AMENITIES  rating 7 out of 10  The engineers did a good job of putting together a nice cab  seats  etc  on this particular model  amp  year  The driver s seat with lumbar and 6 way motorized adjustment gives me an ability to move the seat into almost any position I want  My brother has the same model  amp  year pickup and hates the feel he gets out of his seat  he says he always ends up with a back ache out of it  so I have run into mixed opinions on this feature The gauges are in full view and well lit  The temp  gauge often sticks in the normal operating position during an overnight cool down  my brother s does the same thing  The stereo works well with front and rear factory speakers and provides a good balanced sound  My only complaint here is that the clock literally gains a minute each day  which I don t think should happen with a fully electronic unit  The Air Conditioner works very well as does the heater  both are musts in my book The front passenger s seat tilts forward and rolls full forward all with one release lever  which allows extremely easy access to the rear seat  Speaking of the rear seat  I have found it very stiff and uncomfortable  although my kids and other passengers have not complained  I used to have a  96 GMC 3 4 ton Sierra extended cab  and I found the rear seat in it to be much more comfortable  however SUSPENSION AND RIDE  rating 9 out of 10  This is a truck and it rides as such and so I don t expect anything different out of it  For the most part you do feel the bumps in the road but it is smooth and comfortable and so not unpleasant of a ride  The truck also exhibits a wide turning radius which again you get used to  but it would be nice to be able to turn in a narrower radius in parking lots and on back country roads OVERALL  rating 8 out of 10  I really enjoy the truck  It pulls nice and I feel that I could do almost anything I wanted to do with it  it has the power that I need  yet provides the comfort  space  and other amenities that I desire in a vehicle  especially for long trips with the RV attached
