 When we bought our 1995 Ford Taurus we were in the market for a four door car  We were looking to trade in our 2 door Chevy Cavalier  We had just had our first baby and the 2 doors weren t helping getting the baby in and out of the car along with the other baby items  When we saw the Taurus we loved it  It had leather seats  very roomy and power everything  But we have encountered problems with it  I don t know if it because the previous owner didn t take care of it or what  We have had to fix the transmission twice and replace the fuel pump once  Overall it s costs us over five thousand dollars  But I still love this car  It s not a gas guzzler and it s not a huge vehicle  I would recommend any person with kids to buy this car  It has lots of trunk space as well  great if you have lots of things to take with you anywhere  The seats have lumbar support for those long travels  Only thing I wish it had was heated leather seats  The cold seats in the morning aren t the best
