 Are you looking for a work van   Ford Econoline is the way to go  I haven t owned anything beside a ford van  My last van was a gray Ford Econoline 350  With proper care it lasted me ten years  I bought another van this year  I was contemplating on whether I should try another van  I couldn t even think of another van that would have what I needed  My vans usually go through a lot of wear and tear  I drive around all day from place to place  It is not the most comfortable vehicle though and it can only hold 2 passengers  If you are looking for something to be comfortable  this is not the way to go  It is comfortable for many work vans that I have been in  I would choose a car to drive around in if I didn t have to carry all of my equipment  It is a very economical and durable vehicle
