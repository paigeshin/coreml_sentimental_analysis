 I bought my Escort in 1997 with 48K on it  Now it has 88K and it is 7 years old  Still  it hasn t had any serious problems  I only had to change worn out brake pads and tires  that s it  Engine and transmission work like Swiss watch  It handles road very good  I don t feel any inconveniences with steering  The only problem  as one reviewer had mentioned  was icy condition  You d need to learn pumping breaks with your foot  I did not have any crushes on icy road  but I was close once  Some people consider automatic belts a nuisance  I even like them  Never got caught by a trooper with belts unfastened  Mounting a Christmas tree on the roof  though  creates a problem  Front seats have enough space for legs  but it may be a little cramped in the rear  Trunk is surprisingly large for such a small car  I have a hatchback  but my friend owns a wagon  which I think is smarter  He cannot be more happy about how much stuff he can load in his car Insurance  I pay  280 per year for liability only living in Cleveland area  The size of the car makes it quite unsafe  You can feel being blown from the highway when a large truck passes you  Also  bumpers are plastic  Sometimes it s hard to see what s ahead when an SUV is ahead of you  The position of the rear view mirror is totally wrong  My wife is short   she can see from under it  but I have to bend my neck each time I need to look to the right I general  the car is very good  You won t have to worry about someone stealing it  It is great to commute  Insurance is reasonable  It makes it excellent for students What else  Reader s digest rated Ford Escort 94 as a recommended used car 2000
