 I purchased this fully loaded 2000 Ford Ranger for my wife  The truck is the four door 4X4 off road model with every option available  The sticker price was  25 000  I purchased this truck to replace our 1997 Ford Ranger  Without a doubt the 4 door option is the greatest improvement  It makes the extended cab both useful and convenient  Ford also introduced a combination cassette cd stereo this year which has great sound  We couldn t believe that our 97 model was without cupholders  Ford corrected the problem in the 2000 model  The 2000 Ranger handles very well on the road  We have a cabin near Yellowstone and the Ranger manages the unplowed roads   10 14 inches with ease  It has tow hooks in front and back which make it easy for us to help friends without 4X4s when they take on more than their truck or car can handle I would not recommend that the off road package be purchased unless the buyer really had off road use  We love the flare sides on our sport model and really appreciated the automatic transmission and 4 wheel drive on the fly  All of the options are expensive  but it is a great looking sporty truck to drive br br
