 I recently purchased a 1997 Ford Ranger XLT  It is the 2 3 4 Cylinder engine with a 4 Speed Automatic  It is the single cab shortbed version  It s Caymen Green with a prarie tan cloth interior  First off  this truck was a screaming deal  it was very low mileage and the price was very nice and the dealership  Hemborg Ford of Norco  Ca  is a very reputible and good dealership  This truck feels solidly built  the ergonomics are some of the best for a compact  The standard engine is peppy enough to not aggravate you and the interior feels very nice  The stereo is the AM FM Cassette player and it sounds great for being stock  the A C will either freeze you or toast you if you overdo it  so needless to say  it works good  The ride is bouncy  but it s a truck so that s normal  but it does handle good  though  This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship  As of Mar  15  2002  my truck is still running strong  no squeeks or rattles of any kind  No mechanical problems  save for a burnt out lightbulb that was easily replaced and a flat tire due to broken glass  The Twin I Beam suspension is very competent off road as I found out in the Cajon Pass is So Cal  for a 4 banger with an auto tran  it hauls off road with only a touch of oversteer that is easily controled  I was expecting poor braking performance due to the rear drums  but I was pleasantly suprised about how good it stops  The only things that I don t like about it is that it has no tachometer and the speedlimit governer stops the party at 96 MPH when a lesser Toyota Tacoma tops at 105 MPH  Otherwise I m quite happy with it and when I get out of college and get a better paying job  I ll get a brand new Ranger   XLT or Edge   with the 4 0 Liter V6  5 Speed Automatic Transmission  4 Wheel Drive  CD Player  Power Equipment Group  Off Road Alloy Wheels and the 4 Door Supercab
