 If Ford had really taken this car under their wing  it truly could ve been the  World Car  they were hoping it would be  But with ads seemingly only placed in  Woman s Day  and  Parenting  magazines it s no big surprise sales were poor  In other parts of the world  namely Europe  the Mondeo  their version of the Contour  has done reasonably well and the newest model has won accolades since it s inception  So  it is possible for Ford to build a great car  but it seems recurringly impossible for them to bring it to the U S  without butchering it  With that in mind  you should definitely consider a Contour if you happen across one during your search for transportation  Understand  though  that it helps if you re a  car person  when you drive it  Why  Well  that s hard to explain unless you are a  car person  This car  in every trim level  handles like a dream  If you happen upon a  Sport  model or  SVT  you should definitely take it for a lengthy test drive  If you find a Zetec  the 4 cylinder model  and it s a stick shift  play with it in the high RPMs  The test drive will be more enjoyable and convincing if you can find a nice  twisty road to experiment on Listen for things like engine howl or strange rubbing sounds coming from the wheel area  Wheel bearings are a common failure on this car  as are water pumps  Do your best to find out if the water pump has been replaced  If the car is over 60k miles and still running the original water pump  you may want to consider replacing it  They have a habit of breaking internally  which can result in engine failure if you don t catch it soon enough  I happen to own a Contour with the Zetec engine  I have replaced the water pump  but that s about it  The car is very comfortable on long drives and I really stress the engine everyday  With regular maintenance   notice I said  regular  maintenance  not 15 000 mile oil changes   the car should last you until you re ready for something else  Take care of it and it ll take care of you If you happen to own one or are seriously looking to buy one  stop by http www contour org and visit us  That s the website for the Contour Enthusiasts Group and we ve ran across and fixed almost every problem you could face on a Contour  Hope to see you there
