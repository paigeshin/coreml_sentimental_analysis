 I have a 1999 Wedgewood Blue ext cab  4 door  automatic ranger  It has a v 6 engine and it s fully loaded  I love this truck  Not only is it the best looking truck i have seen in a long time  it is so nice  I would rather be in it than anywhere else  The gas mileage could be a little better  but if you want better mileage i would recommend a standard v 4  which is what i had before this truck  This truck has great features like a switch to turn passenger side air bags off and on  some extended cabs come with 4 doors  which makes getting in and out alot easier  mine can run on ethanol fuel and everything else that you can think of  This truck is also safe  I was recently in an accident  The other car hit me pretty hard and my damage was minimal  This truck is built  quot FORD TOUGH quot This truck is worth every cent that I paid for it  19 998  There is a ranger for every price range  And all of them are wonderful The only thing that I don t like about this truck is the color that I picked  It gets dusty where I live  and my truck is constantly dirty A ranger is a great vehicle for anyone  but since it is so easy to handle on the road  it s a wonderful first car This isn t really a family truck  but what truck is  If you have long legs or a large build  you will not be comfortable in the back seat
