  Needs b After three years of driving my  college car  a Geo Metro  and heady with a summer s worth of paychecks  aka  more money than I d ever seen  I was in the market for an SUV  I d spent the last three years hydroplaning all over Arkansas  highways  I wanted something big  heavy  and solid to drive  I also wanted more power than my little three cylinder I eventually settled on a  Ford Explorer   I started shopping around thinking I wanted all the bells and whistles  namely four wheel drive  I  wisely  ended up with a two wheel drive  Explorer Sport   The two door  Sport  is about a foot shorter than the four door model and seemed huge enough after my Metro  I was also living in Texas and really couldn t justify four wheel drive I m not the off roading type and when Texas gets bad weather  everything completely shuts down anyway  snow and ice holidays yea b Gas Mileage b Let me get this category out of the way  Yes  my SUV is a gas hog  My  Explorer  does have a standard transmission which gets slightly better gas mileage than an automatic  What irks me about all the condemnation of SUVs for sucking down large amounts of gasoline is that mini vans are just as bad in this respect or any other vehicle with a six or eight cylinder engine  While SUVs are  status symbols  mini vans are  family vehicles  and trucks are  quot work vehicles quot  But  I digress b Features b i Anti lock brakes i  Not only has the ABS on my  Explorer   saved me from injury  it also saved me from rear ending a military police car as my  Explorer  slid approximately fifteen feet down an icy incline at a stop sign at Fort Leavenworth  Kansas  in January  The ABS kicked in almost immediately and I was able to stop the vehicle a few inches short of the police car  I also honked the horn to warn the MP that I was on a collision path with his vehicle but he didn t have enough time to react i Visors i  I m rather short  especially when seated  so no visor is perfect or long enough for me  What I like about the  Explorer s  visors are that there are two  one to flip over to the side  and another to flip down in front so that the driver and front seat passenger aren t moving one visor back and forth on a curvy road  Yes  this is a little thing  but the great thing about my  Explorer  are all the details  like an attached gas cap  that add up to comfort and convenience i Cargo Area i  Very roomy  The back seats also fold down  The cargo capacity is by far the most useful feature of this vehicle  I move  on average  every twelve months  and with the cargo capacity  I can take a good chunk of things I ll need right away in my new home  as well as pets  plants  and all the things the movers won t touch like cleaning supplies  batteries  alcohol  Because I have an SUV  the Army will reimburse me a few hundred dollars for moving up to six hundred pounds of my own stuff that I would take with me anyway  I ve crammed about seven hundred pounds in the cargo area and my bike on the luggage rack on top and could still see out the back window  Whenever I buy a piece of furniture  no problem  load it up  Note  as a safety precaution  if you can t close the cargo door completely  drive with the windows down so that any exhaust fumes that may come in aren t overpowering i Cruise Control i  Once you have it  you can t go without it again  I ve driven across the country with and without cruise control  and I prefer having it  The troublesome sciatic nerve in my right thigh also prefers it b Handling b i Stability i  Excellent  Yes  I know all the current furor over the  Explorer s  stability  I ve found my  Explorer  as stable or more stable than other SUVs and high center of gravity vehicles  including the Toyota pickup upon which I learned to drive a standard transmission  I also don t drive like a maniac or a race car driver  The handling on higher vehicles is different than cars acknowledge this from the outset and drive accordingly  As a petite woman  being up high is an advantage for me  I can see the entire road and feel safer and more aware  I recommend that short people get the step  I don t have one and it s not a problem normally  but getting in the seat can be somewhat tricky when I m wearing a mini skirt i Turning Radius i  Excellent  The  Explorer Sport  has an exceedingly tight turning radius for a vehicle its size  I ve driven the four door  Explorer  and the turning radius isn t as great  I easily swing into slanted parking spaces from the opposite direction or make U turns without hitting curbs b Repairs and Maintenance b I ve owned my  Explorer  for six years and other than the  tires   the extent of my repairs and maintenance are as follows  regular oil changes  about every 5 7 000 miles  a new air filter last summer  adjusted brakes this fall at 62 000 miles  some new belts  also at 62 000 miles  when the original ones began to dry rot  new windshield wipers a couple years ago  and I had to use epoxy to glue the gear shift knob back on when it came loose  All the repairs were recommended to me as preventive measures when I took the vehicle in for regular maintenance  I ve never taken my  Explorer  in for  quot problems quot All of the owner operator maintenance parts of the engine  like the oil wand and the opening for adding more windshield wiper fluid  are clearly marked in yellow for dummies like me who don t really know what they re looking for underneath the hood My  Explorer s  rear driver side was dented in a hit and run accident when the vehicle was parked  causing  900 in damages  promptly fixed  One of the tires exploded  my parents were driving so I don t know the details  and caused another  900 in damage to the same area  grrr Firestones  again promptly fixed  I can t tell any difference from when the vehicle was brand new  I also had another Firestone tire  front  driver s side  disintegrate while I was driving 70mph on the highway  I maintained control of the vehicle and came to a stop on the side of the road  Other than the tire  my  Explorer  suffered no damage whatsoever and handled well throughout the incident   And now I have five brand new Firestones I have the extended seven year warranty and haven t used it once  Definitely a waste of money and completely unnecessary for this vehicle b Cost b The sale price of my 1994  Explorer Sport   purchased in September 1994  was  18 168  bargained down from  21 000  sticker price  I probably could have gone lower  but I had the financial wherewithal to pay off my loan in 3 5 years  I m pretty satisfied  especially given that my insurance premiums did not increase significantly from my Metro  and I haven t had to shell out outrageous amounts for maintenance and repairs b Conclusion b My 1994  Explorer  was a good buy and I am loathe to give it up  However  my needs have changed I m moving to a climate that requires four or all wheel drive and I plan to start a family in a few years so a four door model is in order  Will I buy another  Explorer   I m still researching  but I ve narrowed the field to the 2001 all wheel drive  four door  Explorer  and the 2001 four wheel drive  four door  Nissan Pathfinder   I ll let you know in about six months or so  Happy driving br br
