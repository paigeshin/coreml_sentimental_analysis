 Having recently purchased a 2003 Taurus  age is finally starting to get to me  At least I am not too old  as I did not even consider a Buick LeSabre  Ain t middle age great Of all the mid to large size cars available in this class  one has the choice of the Chevy Impala  the Pontiac Bonneville  and the Dodge Intrepid from the domestic manufacturers  and the Nissan Maxmia  the Honda Accord  the Toyota Camary  the Mazda 6  and the Subaru Legecy from Japan  and the Hyundai Sonota from Korea  plus the Volkswagen Passat from Germany The Impala would not have been a bad choice as it is slightly better equipped for about the same price  however the engine is of a cast iron pushrod design that has been around since Louis Chevrolet built his first car in 1912  The interior looks postively cheap  like it was lifted right out of a Chevette  The Pontiac has sooo many tacked on plastic body clading it looks like a third grade car design competition gone amok  The issues I had with the Dodge is that the 2 7 liter engine has a dubious history as I have seen many fail prematurely due to the water pump failing and the pump itself is built into the block All of the cars from Japan  except the Maxmia and Subauru  come standard with 4 cylinder engines  I prefer a 6 cylinder  but where they are an option  this prices them a couple of thousand more than a Taurus  I had driven a Hyundai Sonata  and was somewhat impressed  however it was smaller inside  and I later found out that Hyundai had lied about the horsepower figures for the 2 7 liter engine and had to offer consumers cash or an extension of the warranty The Volkswagen was just too expensive for the amount of room and features Which brings us back to the Taurus  I know that the resale value will not be as good as the Japanese as these vehicles are the choice of rental car companies and commercial fleets  There are simply a ton of Tauruses on the roads and the law of supply and demand dictates that when it comes time to sell or trade  don t expect much  The plus to this situation is that normal wear and tear parts will be easy to come by and downright cheap to obtain I purchased a Taurus SES with the Sport package  With this I received the 3 0 DOHC Duratec V6  two tone cloth bucket seats  special alloy wheels and a rear spoiler  plus Ford threw in a free sunroof  The wife was parcial to getting the leather interior and the wood package  however with the dog to be riding in the back seat  perhaps cloth was the better choice  Stepping up to the SES trim Duratec combo helps avoid having the car appear to be a rental vehicle Driving the Taurus reveals that the Duratec is smooth and powerful  and with a chain driven camshaft design  I will not be worring about replacing the drive belt  It is reasonably quiet and the 4 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly  however it does not allow manual selection for the full range of ratios  Wind noise is not at all objectionable  and the seats are comfortable  The EPA rates this as a large car and interior room is very good  with the exception of the front wheel well intruding on your left foot space  The brakes  std ABS in the SES  are very good  Steering with the variable assist is linear and handling is also very good What you don t get for your money is somewhat minor  Rear disc brakes are only available in the wagon model  however with the front brakes handling 80  of the braking force  this is a non issue  A power adjustable passenger seat is only available in the top of the line SEL model  so your front seat passenger will just have to deal with that the best that they can  Side air bags are also a option  Some of the places where Ford also saved money is in the use of cheap feeling switches  however they all do work and perform their intended uses  The only major gripe that I have is that the cheap plastic console squeaks and that is houses the equally cheap 6 disc CD changer magazine that was made in China  I could have done without the rear spoiler  as I seriously doubt that it adds much downforce or makes the car handle any better With Ford pushing the metal out the door with incentives  this allows one to purchase a fully equipped Taurus for the price of a fully equipped Honda Civic  Nissan Altima  or Toyota Corolla  To me  it was a no brainer  With  4000 in rebates and the ability to purchase at dealer invoice  the initial value is just too hard to pass up
