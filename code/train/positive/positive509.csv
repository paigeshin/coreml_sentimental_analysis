 I was in the market for a new van and I checked out all the mini vans that are out there  I also began to look at the full size vans  I found that I could purchase a brand new Ford E 150 Van Conversion for about the same amount as the mini van  The features in the mini van didn t even compare to the amenities that were available in the van conversion  I got leather seats  4 captain chairs and a bench seat in the back that lowers with the push of a button into a full size bed  I also have a tv  vcr  game port  to plug in the nintendo  and several power ports  We recently took our family of 5 on a road trip for 6 weeks  We plugged in an electric cooler into one of the power ports and the laptop computer into another power port  The kids didn t fight because they each had their own seat and no one had to touch anyone else  They watched movies  played educational games on the laptop  played the regular games that Nintendo has to offer  slept when they wanted to  etc  This is the ultimate family travel vehicle  I also drive the van as my everyday vehicle and love it  I am bigger than most cars on the road  and taller so I see things further ahead of me  I feel safer and the little extra that I spend on gasoline to run a larger van is well worth the cost  If you are considering a van conversion for your family   I highly recommend the Ford E 150 br br
