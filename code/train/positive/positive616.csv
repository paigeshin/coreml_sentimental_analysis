 My Ford Escort is my first car  I purchased a Ford because it was made in the United States and I wanted to feel like I was giving back to my community in some way  I also got a Ford because Ford products are good and reliable products for the most part  My parents had a Ford type vehicle at one point when I was a child and I really liked that car  They also had a Ford Explorer when I got my Escort  So Ford has been a tradition in my family  My favorite feature is my sound system  I love music and the sound system is good  The bass and the treble sound great  It has enough clarity to play my tunes and keep me happy  I do waiver about whether I like the fact that the antenna has to be manually pulled up  But I mostly like the fact that it is manual at least it s something I don t have to worry about when I got through the car wash and for the most part I don t need it for the stations that I listen to on a regular basis  My Ford Escort has enough get up and go for me too  I have a 34 mile commute to work and school five days a week  but I don t seem to need to fill up the gas tank more than once a week for the most part  In cold weather  my car has performed up to the standards I think it should as well  Overall I have no real complaints about my 1998 Ford Escort  I was a little sad that they were discontinuing the Escort in favor of the Focus
