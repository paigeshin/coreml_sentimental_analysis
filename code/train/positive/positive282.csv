 I arrived in the states from Australia at the end of March 1999 to stay there for a year and come home at the end of March 2000  I stayed with friends in South Carolina who is a Ford man as I have always owned GM or Chevs  they lent me a 1979 red corvette until I bought myself a car so after 3 months I did buy a 1985 Z28 Camaro  350  to fix up and use for the 9 months after looking at it I thought this was a bad idea so looked in the local paper and found a red 1991 V8 Thunderbird with 114 000 miles on it for  3000 After taking it for a test drive offered the lady  2800 and drove it home  it had a slight water leak from the water pump  so while replacing it I installed a set of under drive pulleys  which I could notice the power increase the first time I drove it  put a K amp N air cleaner in as well I had a friend come over from Australia so we drove from Greenville SC across to Sequin TX  did about 3000 miles in that trip  we took the long way  and had no trouble at all and got 27 MPG sitting on 80  MPH had a radar detector  it has a highway ratio in it 2 75 My brother came over from Australia so we went from Greenville SC down to Daytona Beach and back  then drove across America to California  which we did about 4600 miles trouble free  When we left Williams AZ the car was buried under snow as we had a cold snap and snow dig the snow away and turn the key starting the engine at once and never missing a beat The car came with the premium sound system  but the radio cassette was playing up so replaced it with a Pioneer radio CD I went to the wreckers and bought an electric motor seat assembly for the right hand side so when converting to RHD will have an electric adjustment  Also bought a sports instrument cluster and centre handbrake assy out of a super coupe These cars were never made for export or for Right Hand Drive  so have to get all the parts needed now for conversion I did 18 000 miles in 9 months without the car stopping or letting me down I gave the car 4 oil changes  added fuel octane booster with every tank of gas  it has the factory 15 quot  alloy wheels with Michelin tyres  I found the car very easy to drive and steer  but did experience brake shudder  which appears to be a common problem due to thin brake rotors I added a rear spoiler and had the windows tinted  which makes the car look sporty  as in Australia the only 2 door cars are mainly Jap imports  so in the end I shipped the car back to Australia where I have to convert it over to Right Hand Drive for our road rules  this cars owes me  10 000 Australia  5200 US  landed back at my house in Australia  which when converted to RHD they sell from  35 000 to  40 000  18 000 to  21 000 US BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED br br
