 I had a 96 Ford Explorer with all of the toys  I really enjoyed this vehicle  However  it does have its faults  It s towing capability isn t good  the in line 6 doesn t have enough power  I know your saying why didn t you get the V8  I ll tell you  To get an Explorer with a V8 I lose the option of 2WD  If Ford would have not went to AWD with the V8 I would have gotten it  It s offroad capabilty it s great either  Low ground clearance and poor shocks are 2 faults So If your looking for a sport utility to drive like a car and get car like gas mileage get an Explorer  If you want a SUV to kick some butt  I d look at a Durango  I have a Durango now br br
