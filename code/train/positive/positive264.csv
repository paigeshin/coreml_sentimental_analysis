 This was my very first car   ever  And my husband could not have chosen a better car  We originally chose it because of the price  It was economical and good on gas and we were hoping to have a family at some time during the cars life  so we chose the wagon  Nine years  four kids and 125 000 miles later  the car is still taking care of us There have been very little problems with this car  The only recurring trouble that we have had to fix year after year is the air conditioning  They told us a few years ago that it was a broken O ring  they tried to give it a recharge of freon  but it still never worked properly  Other than the air conditioning  we never had any problems with the car  So considering the price and the mileage we have gotten out of it  I think that the Ford Escort Wagon was a fantastic deal br br
