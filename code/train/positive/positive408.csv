 To me  this is what Mustang was originally supposed to be about a fun to drive car  comfortable on longer trips  available with a peppy engine that gets reasonable gas mileage  I have the 190 hp six cylinder this car is nice and stable at high freeway speeds  feels heavy and solid on the road  handles well  and seems so aerodynamic  I love mine Laser Red  automatic  4 wheel ABS  good sound system  standard  nice cloth seats  I like a sports car that is still attainable to most of us  that is still in the average American budget Plus  this car is back to what the Mustang was all about too many of our American cars became bloated machines that were nothing like the originals both the Mustang and the Thunderbird come to mind  I love both of these cars though I can t see myself absolutely giving up the rear seat  as in the Thunderbird for 2002  I love the Mustang  my own personal car for zipping around  with a usable rear seat  nobody said HOW usable  but usable br br
