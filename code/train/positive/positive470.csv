 We bought this vehicle because it was newer  we got a good deal  and it holds more passengers We LOVE the way it handles  We had an Explorer before  which really was fun  but the Expedition handles like a large  luxury automobile  not a truck  AND it s attractive and incredibly roomy We really can fit everyone in  My husband  myself and my son  6  and 300 lbs  two step daughters  husband  brother and two nephews  oh AND my dog  Truffles We tolerate the gas useage and it s size can be a bummer when it comes to parking availability for compact cars  There needs to be more parking spaces for SUV s since they are increasing in popularity Don t buy this car if you have no where to park it  but that s the ONLY reason NOT to buy If you have to schlepp anyone around  if you need space for cargo  this is the vehicle for you I wouldn t part with it for any other SUV or truck br br
