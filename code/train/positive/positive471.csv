 Ah yes  behold  another rental car review   With my Sentra SE in the shop  don t worry  just a little fender bender  I now get a chance to review another car  This time  it is the Ford Focus LX   Although it doesn t say so in the back I wonder if this is the same car that another one of our beloved reviewers drove  as it is the same Cloud Nine White colour  and I m in the same  Bay  area  Then again  I m sure Enterprise has a fleet of these cars anyways  as they make great cheap rental cars  Too bad the Prius can t make it  it d be great for renting thanks for it sipping gas conservitively The car that was given me was just washed and clean  with 18K miles on the odometer  Going thru the glove box reviled the manual  which informs me that it is a 2001 model  Oh  did I mention that the interior was funky  I mean it SMELLED funky  and a bit dirty  too  Oh well  that s what happens after 18K worth of previous drivers b Exterior  This is a very attractive car from the outside  It looks very much European  because it was designed there  by the way  and it also have the build quaility of one  Not bad for a base econo car  It has sharp lines and curves  much like a Volkswagen has  Small 14  steel wheels with covers makes the car screem  I m cute  as the body looks like it needs a little more support from a larger set of wheels The front fascia looks aggressive  but can still be mistaken for a Dodge Neon at night  thanks to the position of the turn signals  The back  however  reminds me of the newly designed Honda Civic  except that the lights actually glow in a circle  instead of a tranversed  U Oh  let s not forget the antenna    The cute little antenna in front center of the roof  like most European cars do  VW  The only thing missing that would make it even more Euro like are sidemarkers b Interior  How can I put it  it s  interesting It looks a bit of a mess  like someone just thrown it together  And even if not  it looks more like a Picaso painting if anything else  It certainly matches the exterior well  with sharp lines and curves  triangles  etc  About the only thing normal looking are the gauges  Sadly  the base LX does not have a tachameter  which makes the instrument panel look a bit plain Front seats are confortable  but not too supportive  And  for some reason  saftey reason  the steering wheel is a bit off from center  making it awkward to drive once you notice it  Rear seats are surprisingly confortable  and was able to lull passengers to sleep in a long road trip  Just let only 2 adults back there and no more  please  While not spacious  leg room is surprisingly adaquate as well Visibility does pose a bit of a problem  the side mirrors are too small  while the rear window shares the same problem  The rearview mirror is small as well  and barely covered the entire rear window  The view to the back makes the car seem like it has a butt that is very jacked up  And I do mean UP  Seems the rear is pretty high for a compact car b Creature Comforts  The stereo is one item most will reach out for  and it will only disapoint if alll you carried to your trip are CDs  Standard issue radio cassette just doesn t cut it  The volume is not very gradule  as it steps up and down in VERY DISCRETE STEPS  Going from 1  very audible  to 0 gets you very frustrated  as you can t have anything else inbetween  The 1 setting is still very audible when the car is stopped at a red light  and sounds as if you can still lower it a little more  No fine volume tuning for you  buster The stereo also comes with an anti theft device  how very insulting to car stereo thieves  as a section of the radio preset buttons can be taken with you  The whole anti theft unit can be stored like a pen in your pocket  as there is a pen like clip built in  Gee how thoughtful Strange thing is  it does have one  luxo  feature  which is the automatic volume speed control  or whatever Ford calls it  As you drive faster  the volume gets louder  When you stop  it comes back down  Very annoying  actually  and fortunately  can be turned off  GM cars are having it everyone on their cars  though  Seen one on a Pontiac Sunbird too  Yes  that s an econo rental car  as well The speakers are very boomy and clear  These are the best speakers I ve ever heard on a car being stock  This is very surprising  as it is the most basic system  with only 4 speakers on the doors  Perhaps it is the placement of it  Who knows most cars have the rear speakers on the rear dash  and I guess putting it on the rear doors make that much of a difference  Highs are clearly high  while lows can be felt  I could swear there is an aftermarket sub somewhere hidden in the car Now for the windows and locks  all manual  This car is completely backwards  The locks are LOCKED when the tab is not flush with the handles  Weird  huh  Most car manufacturers with tab locks would have it LOCKED when the tab is flush with the handle door  and UNLOCKED when the tab is stickin  out or just look like it is crying out for attention  sticks out  The Focus is totally backwards  Same for the window cranks  To open the windows  you must pretend you are CLOSING it  and crank it that way  In otherwords  you must crank it AWAY from you to open  while in other cars  that s the way to close windows manually The locks are very confusing  especially since it is manual  as everyone HAS TO LOCK THE DOOR  I can t trust anyone when I ask them  did you lock the doors  All say  YES  but when I checked  all were still unlocked  Hmm The climate controls are a bit easier to contend with  However  the AC and recirculate buttons are positioned too low  which makes it a bit of a hassle to drive and look at where your fingers are hitting b The Drive  I m very surprised to find out that this 2 0 liter engine puts only 110 hp  It must be the torque  being at 125 lb ft   3750 RPMs  That gives this engine the power to move quickly from stops  which is very evident from the moment you step on the pedal  Acceleration is quick  even when you are already moving  The 4 speed automatic is not smooth at times  but still gets the job done  When driven conservitively  however  you won t be able to notice it  I guess the jerking is for those people who enjoy feeling it when they push the car hard  But keep in mind  this is suppose to be an automatic  Automatics are suppose to be smooth and seamless  The transmission also allows the driver to turn off overdrive  which does not allow the transmission to use 4th gear  I never found the need to turn it off  really  If you wanted to downshift  just hit the pedal HARD  The only real need for it is if you need to be in 3rd constantly  like if you were towing something  or dragging something from behind though I don t know who would be doing that   whistles innocently The engine is sooo torquey  that I squealed the tires very easily on dry pavement   Keep in mind that this is an automatic  Then again  it may just be bad slippery tires  as they squeal even on mild curves like on and off ramps  Then again  I may be driving it a tad faster than most consider comfortable  which isn t that bad  HEY  my car doesn t squeal like a pig  The body rolls as well when taking corners  but nothing that would make the ride uncomfortable  After all  people who own this base car don t usually drive like this anyways   Old Kia commercial    Don t worry  honey it s a rental  You may just want to get the sportier ZTS  or the ZX3 hatchback   Perhaps it s the last driver that trashed it  but  the brakes are VERY noisey and feels uneven  I say this because it felt like a warped rotor  so I can t really comment on how the brake feels without finding out if it truely are the brakes  They do stop the car confidently  but shakes like hell  This is NOT ABS  people  as it isn t even included here  Front plow for stopping this car quickly does show up with revenge  however  The suspension is super soft  considering the body roll and front plow For such a soft suspension  it sure does let a lot of road noise in  I have never heard such loud road noise  You can barely listen to the radio  or even hold a conversation with your passengers  We had to yell at the top of our lungs  Below 60 MPH  however  and it s bareable b Conclusion  Only if you can live with it  I say  I sure do hope the higher trims fix most of the glaring annoyances of this car  but just as I said about the Dodge Neon  it s a good rental  Make sure you sugar coat it if you want to buy it I don t exactly know what the 2001 price is  but for 2002  the base LX is  13 220  but I doubt that price includes AC or automatic transmission  I think as the other reviewer I mentioned who probably drove the exact same car I drove  it was probably  14 400 as tested
