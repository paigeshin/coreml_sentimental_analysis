 My T bird has been a great car so far  Everyone who has driven it has commented on how smooth it drives and how well it handles the road  Rain and snow are not a problem  this car is built for all weather conditions  Not to mention  mine came with the climate control that allows you to control the temperature of the car  so it s REALLY a joy to drive  no matter what it s like outside  The only problems I ve had have been that the vacuum hose disconnected itself somehow  but that caused minimal problems   mainly  it just made an annoying sound  I need new engine mounts right now  but I attribute that to the roads in this area   my husband just had all 4 replaced on his car I love the options on my car  and it s good for getting the baby car seat in and out  It s great for local driving or roadtrips  My sister has had to replace the engine and transmission on hers  but it s been driven rough  Treat this car good  and it will be a joy
