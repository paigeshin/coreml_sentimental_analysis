 We bought our car brand new four years ago  It was everything I wanted in a car  even the perfect color of green  We have an automatic with power windows  cd player from the factory  and air conditioning This car has been great  No major problems  We have had to replace the power window switch once  but other than that nothing major The only thing I would change about the car is something very simple and that is I would have a middle arm rest for the driver  Like I said that is something that anyone can live without The car has great pickup pulling out on a major highway and also does great up mountains At first I worried about having a two door when taking others on trips with us  If I were to buy another car today I would probably buy a four door  because it is a little hard for adults to climb in the back seat of the car  As far as leg room it seems to have plenty for four adults We have taken two other adults on many trips with us and never hear any complaints on the leg room Our car came with the extra stereo package which is great  It has a great sound to it The car rides very smooth and handles well I would recommend this car to anyone  In fact I just went with my little brother to buy his first car  He also got an Escort a 92 model and he also loves his Hope this helps
