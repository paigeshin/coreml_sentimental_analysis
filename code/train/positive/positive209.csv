 We bought the Ford Explorer because it had more room than the Mazda Protege we used to own  I absolutely love my truck  My husband and I bought it with all wheel drive all the time  I like the way it rides  it feels like we re riding on a pillow  The only complaint I have about it is that it guzzles gas  but that s because in order to get the all wheel all time you had to buy the V8  The V8 has awesome pick up its the 5 0 engine that used to be put into a Mustang  It s a lot of fun to drive  The people who want to buy it is someone looking for a bigger vehicle  It may be a little more expensive than some other Sport Utility Vehicle s  and that might make a person not want to buy it br br
