 With  2500 in Ford Citibank dollars to apply toward the purchase of my 1996 Eddie Bauer 4x2 Explorer  it was hard to choose another SUV  However  I test drove all the rest  At that time  the Chevy Blazer had the smoothest ride  but the inside had too much plastic  The Toyota 4Runner was hot  but close to  6 000 more than a comparably equipped Explorer  Also  I discovered that the insurance on a 4Runner was  600 year higher  After 45 000 miles  my Explorer has operated with zero defects  Other than changing the oil every three thousand miles  and one thorough servicing  250  at 30 000 miles  I haven t spent a dime maintaining this truck  The paint has held up to the abuses of street parking in Los Angeles and San Francisco  The ride is a bit rough for those looking for more of a car than a truck  If I had to do it over  I would have waited until 1997 to get the larger V6  The 160hp V6 in my Explorer is pretty weak and a 190hp V6 was offered in 1997  Other than that  the interior is extremely comfortable  The Eddie Bauer package includes power  leather seats with power lumbar support   an excellent feature for long drives  This is a solid truck that is proving to be a great value br br
