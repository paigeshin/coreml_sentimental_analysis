 I really love the Ford Expedition  I ve had it a year now and it still drives like it did when I first bought it  I used to own an Acura Integra but after having two children  we needed a more spacious vehicle  The Ford Explorer was the most popular at the time but the Expedition caught our eye because of its size and luxury look  It looked like more than just a truck  We got the leather interiors  chrome accents and running boards and it sure looks great  The kids love it because we can take all their friends along and they also have  quot kid room quot  The far back seat is fun for them cause it has a little bounce to it My husband has found the vehicle useful for his new Disc Jockey business  He just pops out the third row seat and his equipment fits nicely in the back  I love how it rides and turns  It rides just like a car and handles really well  The only problem we ve had with the vehicle was an oil leak  The dealer was really great about getting it fixed right away  We re back to smooth sailing again We also took it on a west coast vacation trip from Southern California to Northern California  We ll never take a road trip in a little car again  You ride up high  you re in control of the road  It s great family fun br br
