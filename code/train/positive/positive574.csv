 The precursor to the highly touted Ford Focus  the Escort is a small  economical car  My 1997 Escort is a 4DR with a small engine but can really crank out the gas mileage  Even today  with 50 000 miles I average around 29 30 miles a gallon  I have relied on this car for two years to drive me 5 hours to college and make multiple road trips The only problems I have encountered in 2 years of used car ownership have been minor electrical problems with the dome light and trunk light  I also needed to buy a special CD player installation kit from Circuit City when I put in sound system  However  even the base speakers pack a punch in a little body The best part about my model is that the back seats fold down  creating a massive amount of trunk space  and wide enough area to fit long objects  like my hockey sticks  If your concern is that it appears to be a weak   grocery getter  rest assured the designers did a good job creating a trendy  smooth look  The 4DR models with a spoiler and moon roof and the 2DR ZX2 are also very stylish The 1997 Escort is the perfect first or second car for young drivers and a reliable auto for anyone
