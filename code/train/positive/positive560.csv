 I bought my Contour with almost 100k  and it still runs great  It is very reliable  and has nice creature comforts  CD  sunroof  power everything  It is not very flashy  or overly sporty  It doesn t have much get up and go  but I do feel very safe with dual airbags  and traction control  It gets decent gas mileage  and seats four adults comfortably  I would recommend this car to someone looking for endurance at a good value  This car is also very easy to work on  and parts can be found at most major parts stores  I would recommend attempting personal maintenance over dealer maintenance which I was disappointed in the one time I took it to them br br
