 When I see a Ford Expedition on the street  I decide for buy it  Because it was excellent  It is better than Lincoln Navigator and Dodge Durango  Because It is more powerfull than Durango  cheap than Navigator and has same luxury whic I buy a Eddie Bauer 4x4 Fully Loaded  You can drive it ar snowy  rainy days without dangerous  It is an excellent car  More roomy than Durango and strong than Navigator ENGINE  V8 The current V8 gives out 260hp  I feel more  which are adequate numbers for adequate engine performance  We could feel the power draining a bit when we loaded the truck with people  however  Still  the shifts are smooth and the power curve is evenly proportioned throughout acceleration  My main gripe with the engine is the sub par fuel economy  Even for an SUV  the Expedition especially 4WD models  I hear  seemed excellent  The rather not small gasoline tank is not to blame for frequent fill ups  I would not recommend the 4 6 235 hp 8 cylinder that is also offered  Manual transmissions are not available for either engine selection  although automatics are far more popular The Expedition uses an on demand 4 wheel drive system and can be shifted from 2 wheel drive into 4 wheel drive while the vehicle is in motion  Maximum towing capacity is 8000 lbs br br
