 The 2001 Mustang is a fun car to drive and look at  With its rear wheel drive it handles the corners quite nicely  Be careful on wet pavement though  as the tires fight to get traction  The v 6 engine has some pep in it  This car really takes off from a stand still  Passing cars on the highway is not a problem as the engine has a lot in reserve  Two small problems with the engine  First  between 35 50 mph  the engine seems to lose power and gets sluggish  Secondly  when you accelerate it takes a few seconds for the engine to respond  When it does respond  though  you do have some decent power  If you are looking for performance  I would recommend getting the GT  v 8  When you get to the interior of the car  you start to see where Ford cut costs  The light knobs  a c controls are very cheap looking  If you want rear floor mats for this car  you have to purchase them seperately  The glove compartment is too small  and in a very inconvenient location  I do like the OPTIONAL mach 4 audio system  It is well worth the extra money IF you want a decent stereo system  The body styling of the Mustang is beautiful  Many people tend to stare at the Mustang longer than most cars One complaint  the front end Where the optional flood lights would go  the Mustang has some plastic air vents These break EASILY and it somewhat ruins the look of the car  The antenna is in an awkward place and it also detracts from the look of the Mustang  Overall  the Mustang delivers a decent sports car for the price
