 My husband comes from a Ford family  The only make of vehicle that they will buy is Ford  The majority of the cars we have owned are also Fords  Ford stands for stability and durability The Ford Taurus is a wonderful family car with plenty of leg room  The comfort for long trips is outstanding  Comfort should be the Taurus  middle name  The trunk space is more than large enough for luggage or groceries The car drives like a dream and is easy to steer  It provides a very smooth ride for short and long trips  As a mother of small children  I love that you can lock the windows and doors at the driver s side  The doors are easily locked and unlocked from the outside as well  With only 1 turn the driver s side door is unlocked  with 2 turns all doors are unlocked  I think this is a nice safety feature The car would make a wonderful car for anyone  The Taurus is well known for its safety  Besides being a wonderful family car  it looks more than nice enough for any business executive to drive as well  This is by far the best car that we have owned
