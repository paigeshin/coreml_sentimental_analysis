 I received an invitation in the mail from a new car dealership that just opened in Kenton  Ohio back in August of 1999  Statewide Ford had bought out another dealer and was having a kind of grand opening  Present this letter and test drive any vehicle and receive a free tool kit  What I got was one mean SHO  A 2 year old  just turned in from a lease with only 21 000 miles  burgandy with tan interior  chromed spoke rimmed  leather seated  3 4 liter  32 valve  duel overhead cam  fuel injected V8 with a moon roof and am fm cassette player with 6 CD changer in the trunk  auto temp a c and heat  auto lights  and a leather covered steering wheel  Oh  did I mention it will do every bit of the 150 mph that the speedometer registers  Well  it will  And the best part is it was only  16 000  I wouldn t trade it for a field full of Monte Carlos  Grand Prix  or Intrepids  Despite how fast it is and how well it handles it s also my family car  Fixed or repaired daily  Not this Ford  I love everything about this car and hate nothing about it  I wouldn t recommend it to the faint of heart or someone who thinks only a mechanic can raise the hood  After all  I do add my own windshield washer fluid br br
