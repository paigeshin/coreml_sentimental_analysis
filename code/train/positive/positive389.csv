 I bought my 1996 Contour used last June  My overall impression of the car is good  I bought the 5 speed because I think it is more fun and easier to control  especially in the snow  Front wheel drive also makes it great for snow driving  There are so many things I like about it  cruise control and tilt steering wheel dual airbags  ABS brakes  A C and power door locks  windows and mirrors  I guess what I am saying is that it has all the bells and whistles I like  I bought it because I wanted a larger car  I had a 2 door Neon  that was more comfortable  The seats in the Contour are so comfy  I test drove a brand new Escort ZX2  or something like that  the newest one  and sighed a huge sigh of relief when I got back into my Contour  This car is not a sports car by any means  but it has get up and go as well as comfort  There are a few things I would change though  one is the cupholder  yes  only ONE  it is pathetic and broken already  Another thing I would change is the mechanism to recline the seat  I have to roll it backward over and over to recline  same to put it upright again  A major waste of time  I would love my car more if it got better gas mileage  I average 25MPG  There have been several Ford instigated recalls for warranty repairs  however in my case they were all preventative as I have not had a single problem in the past 8 months  I did buy the extended warranty though  those bells and whistles get pricey to fix  I would say test drive one  you might like it br br
