 My previous car was in the shop for repairs and I had to rent a car  1997 Ford Contour was what I rented and I really enjoyed  The car has a personality that I love to drive  While the price for a new car was out of my reach  I found a great value in a barely used 96 model  While the car doesn t have a large engine  it has plenty of pickup and handled large inclines easily  The only problem I found is head space  I am over 6 foot tall and it can become a little uncomfortable in long drives  The front wheel drive and stable wheelbase  makes it a easy car to drive and get through town to get the daily errands accomplished Update  August 2002 The car is now 5 years old and has 75 000 miles plus  The motor continues to run smooth and very reliable  The interior has held up and is in very good condition  The exterior is very good for this amount of use  I drive is daily  thus there are many dings and scratches from rocks and other debris in the road  The car has had a couple of recalls and Ford has fixed them quickly  Both recalls were for things that I was not experiencing  brakes and exhaust  The only negative thing to mention is the ride  Our other car is a 2001 Dodge Caravan  The smoothness of the Caravan makes the Contour seem alot rougher  Over a week may go by and I won t drive the van and the Contour seems very smooth  But then I drive the van and the I become less pleased  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is wanting a good car to last a long time
