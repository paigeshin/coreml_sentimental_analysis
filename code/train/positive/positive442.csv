 On a recent vacation  I got plenty of time to become acquainted with the 2001 Ford Taurus   7 days and 1200 miles worth  We drove from Las Vegas to LA  San Diego  and Laughlin The exterior of the car has a modern look is is a vast improvement from the last generation of Taurus that looked like an egg on wheels  Nothing too fancy and not bland  perfect mix for a family car The Taurus has a well laid out interior  All switches were easily within reach and gages were easy to read  The 6 way power driver seat was easy to operate and it did not take long to find a comfortable position  Overall  the interior is very generous with ample headroom and legroom The base V6 and automatic transmission setup was good but not great  I didn t have any problems climbing the mountains between California and Nevada and the transmission downshifted at the right times  If I were to purchase a Taurus for myself  I would opt for the 200HP engine The suspension provided a smooth  family car  ride  held corners well  and transmitted little road vibration to the cabin  The turning radius was a too little large  As a tourist  I found myself making frequent U turns  because I was lost quite a bit  and the car seemed to have a larger turning radius than similar cars in its class  I ended up making a few 3 point turnarounds instead of U turns due to the large turning radius I was not able to accurately measure the gas mileage as all the driving we did was highway driving  I averaged about 28 29 MPG over the trip One thing I did not like was the operation of the AC compressor with the climate control system  The AC compressor is engaged automatically at the different vent settings leaving no manual AC switch to engage or disengage  I prefer to have the AC switch separate because in mild weather I will turn the AC off to improve upon gas mileage My only other complaint was a minor build quality issue  When I opened the trunk  the lining material was pulled away from the sides and would not go back into place In closing  this was the first time I enjoyed driving a rental car  Ford offers a good package of options at a competitive price  Next time we are shopping for a family car  the Taurus will be on our list
