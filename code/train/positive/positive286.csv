 With the upcoming demise of the GM F body cars  the Mustang remains the first and last of a long breed of American muscle  The 2001 Mustang GT certainly holds itself to some pretty steep standards  and it does just fine in meeting them too First off  let s talk power  The thing is rated at 260hp and 300  lb feet of torque  For those of you who don t know what those numbers mean  it s fast  At 260hp it s easily out muscled by Camaros and Trans Ams  but not much  if anything  else in the general price range provides the tire shredding power that a properly driven GT can produce  and the F Bodies generally cost a little more anyway  Mine is  temporarily  and automatic  so I lose a little in the 0 60 and 1 4 mile numbers  but it s still no slouch  Onramps have never been this much fun and passing is a breeze  The motor responds well to pressure on the pedal but isn t as harsh as many of the other big V 8s  With the traction control  it even survives hard mashing on the accelerator so you get some extra traction that s somewhat atypical of RWD muscle  The exhaust looks and sounds good  but I would have preferred a slightly throatier note from it Next up is the handling  This thing hugs curves like a car half its weight  You have to be careful because the short  light backend is highly prone to scampering out from under you  but on dry  clean pavement this thing holds the road tight and doesn t let go  Just watch it in the rain though  and snow is out of the question On to more practical items  the car is fairly comfortable considering its lineage  I have charcoal gray leather and they look good and feel very supportive  but not hard  The ride is  however  jarring because the suspension is fairly stiff to accomodate it s excellent handling  It can grow tiresome very quickly on constantly rough pavement  Also  don t try to shove anyone except the smallest children in the back  Anyone over about 10 years of age is not going to be please with you otherwise Gas mileage is acceptable  but this is a moderate size V8  so don t expect miracles  I get about 19 26 with my driving habits The car  overall  looks good  The interior overcomes the annoying Ford  plastic dollhouse  look and  unlike say the Probe  doesn t look cheap and flimsy at all  In fact  what clinched the Mustang for me over a brand new Tiburon GT  besides the extra power  was the less cheesy looking insides of the Mustang  The paint is also very nicely done  The only issue I have with the looks is the plastic inserts in the fake hood scoop and side  vents  From a distance they look fine  but up close they re not very attractive  I might go so far as to recommend actually removing them from the side  vents The only complaints I have otherwise are that the transmission in the automatic is somewhat sloppy for a purported Muscle Sports car  It doesn t like to shift too hard which hurt performance  However  the stick has issues of it s own  so I would recommend following my lead and just get a good aftermarket system if you don t want to live with the annoyances of the stock 5 speed and the power loss of the automatic
