 When the demands of family life outweigh the number of seats in your regular cab pickup what can you do  TRADE UP  This is my second ford truck  In fact I would say that this is close to my dream truck  My wife and I looked at the Taurus Wagon  the Volvo Wagons  Ford Explorer  Subaru Wagon and a few minivans  Our main goal was to get a roomy car for long trips and to have a second car that could hold two child car seats and two more adults  A secondary issue was replacing my truck which is a 1997 F 150 regular cab  I also wrote review on that truck  My wife was leaning toward the Volvo and I of course wanted more truck After shopping around  I went on a test drive with the salesman  In the middle of the drive I called my wife and we stopped by to get her and my two boys  So  during the test drive we had two large male adults  me and the salesman both 250 lbs  my wife and two car seats with the boys  riding comfortably  My wife was really amazed at the space in the cab  with the bonus of having a truck bed Let me describe my truck  It is a silver 2003 F 150 Supercrew XLT 4x4  4 6 V 8  with the Class III towing package option and ABS all around  It also includes cruise control  AC  17 inch wheels w OWL tires  3 73 rear axle an in dash single CD player  power windows  power locks  power mirrors  fog lights and a Ford bed liner  For all those with kids  there are tether anchors in the rear  During the first week I had the truck  I put approx  1000 miles on it doing my work commute and routine errand running  My initial impression is that Ford really softened the ride so that you don t get that jarring truck feel when going over bumps  No mistaking  it doesn t equal a car s ride  but it rides like a very smooth truck  In addition Ford fixed the issue that I had with my 1997 F 150  by moving the exhaust pipe to exit behind the rear wheel  The rear seats fold down to provide dry storage inside of the cab  It is a split bench in the rear  so I can still fold down 1 3 of the seat and have the two car seats in the back  In the front  you can also ride three adults comfortably  so it really is 6 passenger seating  This car is perfect for our 4 member family and is a great utility for us as homeowners  Before we started our search I thought we would have to forsake the utility of a truck  However the Super Crew  and other four door trucks  covers a lot of bases Some of the other things I have noticed about the truck are that the driver has excellent visibility of the road around him her  This truck has large mirrors and the hood drops away so that the driver can see what is immediately in front of the truck  The factory radio is decent but is easily drowned out when you have the windows down  The over head console has a compass and outside temperature  but no other information  I would like to see maybe distance to empty  gas mileage etc  The electronic odometer has a trip computer  The gauges on the truck show speed  tachometer  oil pressure  system charge  coolant temperature  The middle seat in the front folds down to be a storage compartment and has two cup holders  There are also two cup holders in the rear  I also have two outlets in the front  radar detector and cell phone  and an outlet in the rear located in the seatbelt anchor  This outlet in the back is perfect for cell phones and laptops  My wife likes the under seat storage in the rear also  Behind the rear seats are storage compartments and one of them holds the jack and tire iron for the truck  The truck came with floor mats and treated upholstery  something similar to scotch guard So far the drawbacks are pretty standard  The gas mileage is an issue but is to be expected with a large truck that is V 8 powered  The other issue is that the brakes  while adequate  feel a little mushy  The 4 6 V 8 also only rates in my opinion as adequate  I have learned not to drive a truck like a car  so this isn t a big issue to me  The tires that came with the truck are Goodyear Wranglers  I don t have any complaints so far on the tires  but I like the Dunlop Rover LT s which are excellent in the rain  I will let you know how the Wrangler s do b 2500 Mile Update b This truck has done pretty well during the break in period  One minor issue is the adjustable pedals  gas   brake  there is a switch on the dash for moving them and it is NOT deactivated while the truck is in motion  I sometimes nudge the buttons with my knee  Towing  I towed a 88 Ford Crown Victoria to the auction  on an auto transport trailer   30 miles  The 4 6 V 8 was adequate task but could really use more power when towing something that large  like the 5 4L v 8  With the overdrive disabled  the truck would really lug going up hills with the added weight  Other than that the engine is more than adequate for family hauling and highway cruising  I was able to 4x4 with a full load of wood with no problem in wet muddy terrain  With regards to gas mileage   I monitor with trip computer and gas receipts  I am getting 17 mpg on highway and 14 in the city  My initial mileage  first 1000 miles  was around 14Hwy 12City   If we can put a man on the moon  we can make a light duty  4x4  V 8  funtional truck that gets 18 MPG city and 22 MPG HWY Family Duty is where the truck really shines  Trips to Sam s Club with the family are a breeze with plenty of room for bulk paper towels  bulk food and other gargantuan grocery list items         At highway speeds the truck has very little wind noise in the cabin  compared to my 97 truck  Also when the truck has a few hundred pounds in the bed and 4 5 people in the cab  it rides like a luxury car  When the bed is empty and you are by yourself  prepare to bounce over every bump  price you pay for HD suspension and having a truck  All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase at this point  My wife also really likes the truck now  We have to fight for the keys  She feels very comfortable driving it  good visibility  she likes the functional privacy glass in the rear to keep sun off the kids  the child locks in the rear are a plus and so far her only issue is getting used to climbing up into the truck
