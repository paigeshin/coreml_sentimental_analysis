 At the age of 16 I bought my first 1992 f 150 it was a great truck it had 100 000 miles on it and still ran like a top  I added a K N filter and it upped my horse power and shortly after that i added dual exhaust and man did that baby roar  I had very little engine trouble  In that fall of 2003 I sold this truck but not because of the truck I just wanted bigger and better so I bought my second 1992 F 150  I can haul anything that I need and have all the horsepower any country hick like me would need  I have never been stuck even though I have tried  I have many late night calls to pull vehicles out of ditches or mud and have not had a problem yet  This truck also has over 100 000 miles and I have yet to have any engine or transmission problems probably due to the fact that the engine is very strong and has great get up and go power and the tranmission has very smooth shifting  I would put my 1992 F 150 against any full size truck out there Now I am now 18 years and have been a F 150 lover for 2 years now and will never go back  Not only have I not had any mechanical problems but no structural problems either I am more impressed with this truck than any other  The handling on this vehicle is decent the turning radius isn t the best but all around it is alright  I haven t ever had a load on the vehicle that has ever effected the handling  The brakes on the F 150 are excellent with very good stopping power  The only thing I could say is that they are relatively touchy If you are out there and you are looking for raw towing power along with horse power and a comfortable smooth ride on and off the highway with a drivers seat that you could sleep in that will get you around anywhere then the ford F 150 4 wheel drive is the way to go One drawback to this vehicle is the gas mileage on the regular stock truck I would get about 16 17 mpg on the highway and about 13 14 in town but now that I have the 33  tires and the 3  body lift I get about 9 10 in town and 11 12 on the highway So far with my F 150 I have added many accessories to my truck like  3 inch body lift  33 inch mud brute tires  5th wheel hitch in the middle my truck bed  K N high performance air filter  Delta toolbox  Reese hitch So if you are out there and looking for a truck with all around use this is the one for you it hasn t let me down and I don t believe it would let you down either
