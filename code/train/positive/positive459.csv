 After two station wagons and two minivans  Chryslers  we wondered if moving to a big SUV would be the right move  Our question now is  why did we wait so long  While minivans are quite practical for families with younger children  lower floors  easier entry  walk thru access from the front seats  our eight seat Expedition is perfect for our junior high and high school aged children  Not only does is suit their need to not be seen in a minivan  it affords them much more legroom and space for their bookbags  soccer balls  and extra friends  Although access to the far back seat is a bit cumbersome  kids have a hard time determining which of three levers need to be unlatched to move the mid seat out of the way the slightly elevated aft seat offers all occupants a good view up ahead  Our Eddie Bauer edition comes with efficient dual zone air conditioning with rear seat controls and radio CD buttons and headphone jacks which keeps them busy and quiet in the passenger compartment  Before we committed to the Expedition  we drove it home to see if it would fit into our garage  We found out that not only did it fit nicer than our old Grand Caravan  it was also much easier to maneuver into the garage due to it s speed sensitive power assisted steering  The higher driving position and large windows also seem to make visibility better than our Caravan  On the down side  our Expedition cost thousands of dollars more than the minivan  and has averaged 12 7 mpg in the course of running the kids all over town  It s rugged styling and aggresive tires are probably more suitable for at least a bit of off road driving  but I don t know if more comfortable  fuel efficient tires would ruin the overall appeal  It is an SUV for heavens  sake  We intend to keep the Expedition until our oldest daughter goes off to college next year  Then with only two of our four children remaining at home  we may take a closer look at something a bit more practical  That new Selectronic transmission  V 8 equipted Lincoln LS seems to have my name written all over it br br
