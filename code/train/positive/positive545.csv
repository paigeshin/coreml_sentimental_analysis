 I recently had the chance to rent a loaded Escape for a week long business trip an experience I have been looking forward to having  Overall  I liked the Escape a great deal  but I m not sure I d plunk down my own hard earned dollars to own one The Escape does everything well  It is amazingly roomy and well laid out for such a small vehicle  Seat comfort was great  there was TONS of cargo room  ride and handling were very enjoyable  and the V6 performed well  Ford offers lots of well thought out gadgets and toys in the Escape things like armrests and storage compartments and radio controls feel especially well placed and engineered  The Escape was easy to drive for long periods and was an enjoyable  airy place to spend time  On the highway and back roads  the Escape handles better than almost every other SUV I ve ever driven  large and small  I even had the chance to take the Escape off road a little bit  and it was less happy there  The Escape felt much more like a tall station wagon than a true SUV while off the pavement  I recall my mother s Explorer feeling much the same when taken off the beaten path  Of course  most folks will never use the Escape s SUV ness in anything other than snow and rain  and I m sure that the all wheel drive is perfect in these situations  However  the AWD was slow to engage off road and the minimal ground clearance  for an SUV  didn t help matters My complaints about the Escape are  ironically  centered around its strengths  Though the Ford is very good at lots of things  it seems to have sacrificed being truly great in any areas to be so competent overall  The V6 is powerful  but it sucks up gas and is VERY noisy  So much so that the radio has to be blared to drown out the sound  As long as you have plenty of CDs which you enjoy on hand you will never mind  but there is no Escaping the fact that this is a noisy  and thirsty  vehicle  The ride and handling are great in 90  of situations  but one cannot sling this thing around a highway off ramp at high speeds  Finally  to make such a fine vehicle it feels that Ford has cut costs in building materials and construction  The Escape I drove had lots of rattles and felt and sounded generally loose  but this may be due to the fact that it was a rental and rentals are usually beaters  Still  a brand new car shouldn t have felt so loose I have been thinking about getting a small SUV  and the Escape would be high on my list  So would a number of other terrific choices  though  I feel that a Jeep Liberty is just as pleasant a place to spend time  and the Jeep has lots more character  both inside and out  The Jeep also handles poorly  though  and is just as thirsty and loud as is the Escape  Then again  the Jeep would go literally anywhere  on road or off  I feel that the new Land Rover Freelander is similar more uniqueness but less utility  I think if it were my   on the line  I d go for the redesigned Honda CR V  Sure  it s be a little slower than the Escape and certainly more dull to both look at and drive  but the Honda s quality and fit and finish would be impeccable  it would be more efficient  and have even more room  Of course  none of this changes the fact that the Escape is a great all around car and I would certainly recommend it to friends who have lots of   for fuel and who are already hard of hearing
