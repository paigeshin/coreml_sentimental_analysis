 I bought my  92 Ranger back in Dec of  91 right off the showroom floor  It was just a bit above factory standard  amp  cobalt blue  my fav  color  I was on leave from my Air Force technical training course and was about to be shipped off to Offutt AFB  I needed a truck that could handle a 500 mile trip without breaking this little airman s wallet 04 25 00 Here s some requested information about the engine  2 3 liter  100 h p  4 cylinder As I stated earlier the truck was cobalt blue  here s the rest of the info  XLT  2 wheel drive  5 speed manual transmission  4 cylinder  standard sound system  All said and done it cost me  9500   2 9  financing  over 5 years  I had this truck until 1999  when I upgraded to an F 250  During that time I had only one thing that went wrong  The cellenoid sp  freaked out twice and I had to jump the posts to get the truck to turn over  I also had two factory recalls  Recall 1  A bad seal in the drivers door that might cause the door to open suddenly if water seeped in and froze  Recall 2  A faulty oil pump  I loved this truck  It was small enough that it was able to get 28 MPG on the highway and wasn t a nightmare to park  while still being big enough to haul around things like queen size mattresses with no problem  This truck is a great  quot first truck quot  and is also great for people who need a truck that gets great gas mileage  My one complaint about the Ranger  and Ford trucks in general  is the location of the spare  I had a flat once and I had to drag myself under the truck to get the spare off  it should be a bit easier than that br br
