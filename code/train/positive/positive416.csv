 Prior to my new mustang  I had bought the 1994 model which was a new body design as with my current purchase  Both times I was extremely pleased with my purchase  Its always nice to get looks and compliments from strangers  especially when its a new body design  it just grabs attention  I bought the 1999 Mustang V6  there is no major changes to the year 2000 model  But compared to the previous years  model  the POWER is finally a long awaited  welcome to the new body desing  It was getting embarassing driving beside the VW Golfs  Jetta  Passats in their V6 engines  Not to mention the Hondas  Acuras  or the GM s and their peppy engines  For an American  quot muscle car quot  how could you have only put 135 HP on the V6 engine   But now  with 190 HP on the V6  you get the respect that was long overdue  But don t use the regular unleaded gas  you get nothing like the power it should have when you use the premium  Base models are packed with features that most people want  Power driver seat  Air Cond and Power Windows  ABS is an option  but I would strongly recommend it for this car  It sucks in the rain  and not that much better in the snow  But still  one of my favorites cause it is still rear wheel drive  Dual cup holders that actually hold the larger fast food cup sizes now  Well  large lit displays with easy to reach controls  I bought the model with the Mach460 sound system which is supposedly made by JBL it is sweet sounding and has a pretty hard punch to its bass  Ride is quiet  smooth for a sports car  and the engine exhaust sounds throaty unlike previous years when it sound winey and wimpy  Still  it can be improved to give the growl  even if it is only a V6  15 quot  Tires are too narrow  have to upgrade to at least 16 quot  Gas milage is a concern  it has gone down from my 1994  I spend about  15 for 80 Miles and that usually lasts me about 2 days only   As with my 1994  I ve had to do nothing but oil changes so far  For the price  it is still one of the best buys on the market  There are so many toys as well for this model  body kits  computer chips to boost HP  exhaust kits  etc  I bought the 1999 25th Anniversary edition and Ford showed some class by sending me a 25th anniversary kit that included a book of the Mustang s history  stickers and some other tidbits A few negative things I noticed so far is that in my automatic transmission  after coming to a stop  the transmission shifts back to 1st and you can feel a push jolt  So make sure you have your foot on the brake tight when you are at stop lights  Also  driver s seat belt locks up sometimes and straps you in to tight  The trunk height is useless  can t even fit a large suitcase in their  May be deep but height is a real problem  Why can t the make the trunk deeper like in European or Japanese models  br br
