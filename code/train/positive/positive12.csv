 Well  since this is my first new car  I might be a bit biased  but I have had a very good experience with my ZTW  The total price with taxes  extended warrenty  undercoating  and bike racks was about 28000 Canadian  I got this price with a 1000 dollar university graduate credit from Ford as well as a Z plan Discount of about 3000 dollars  my grandfather worked for Ford  so I can buy any Ford car from the dealer at below cost  I will admit that the Z plan price was the main reason I looked at the Focus in the first place  but I have become rather impressed with the car as a whole and would buy it again if I didn t have any of the discounts  Pros I previously owned a 1995 Honda Civic  and with a wife  two sixty pound dogs  and two mountain bikes life was a bit cramped  My wife and I settled on the Ford Focus because we didn t want the expense of owning and maintaining an SUV  but we still wanted the increased cargo space  During the Christmas season I had to commute from Canmore to Calgary  about 100 kms each way  and I m amazed that I could get so much in the car  The road noise is almost non existant with the optional factory undercoating  and the milage is getting better every day If you can afford the extra price  I highly recommend getting the ZTW  Our dealer had a stick shift ZTW on the lot  with a moon roof and we were more than happy to take it off of his hands  The moon roof can retract completely into the roof  or raise up at the back at the touch of a button  and I m finding the ABS brakes combined with the traction control allows me to drive through anything  which is a blessing when dealing with the snow and ice  My wife loves the heated seats  and the Cruise control is very easy to use without needing to take your eyes off the road  Our Ford dealer  Metro Ford in downtown Calgary  has a connection with a rack company  and supplied us with two Yakima LockJaw bike racks at cost  The racks are unbelievable as far as quality  but others have reviewed the Lockjaw so I won t go into any detail As with other reviews  I have to agree that Ford has tried to think of everything  There are pockets  compartments  and features everywhere  I don t like where some of the controls are located  the parking brake is directly below the drivers armrest  making it difficult to get to  but all the controls needed while driving are easy to see and reach witt minimal distraction to the driver  And unlike our Civic  the back seats are roomy  and comfortable Cons My only major complaint was the factory installed dog barrier  Our dogs like the taste of steering wheels  dashboards  emergency brakes  etc  etc  so we needed a dog barrier for the rear cargo area  I didn t want a cheap piece of junk from Canadian Tire  and Ford was more than happy to supply one  although they couldn t show me what it looked like  or describe it in any way  Even the service guys admitted they had no idea what to expect as far as installation was concerned  Here s the problem The dog barrier supplied by Ford looks like it was made to withstand a battling ram and is not removable  The dealership also needed six hours of labour to install it  requiring the removal of the back seats and two rather large holes into the side panels in the back  I have to question why Ford would market the Focus s cargo capacity  and then engineer a non removable dog barrier that completly eliminates the ability to use that cargo capacity  Thankfully the dealership listened to our complaints and removed the dog barrier  replacing the back panels as well  free of charge I have also read some reviews regarding painful wind noise caused by the rear windows rolled down at highway speeds  I tried it yesterday and I must admit that there is a bit more noise than I would like  but since I have a moonroof  and air conditioning  I doubt I d ever be driving like that again so I can t complain Thanks for your time  and have fun buying a new car Adam Price Calgary
