 some history I have always been a Ford boy  Had an 84 BroncoII  still have a 86 BroncoII  Stills runs great with 200 K showing and is my current hunting wagon  So my experience with supposedly easy to tip over SUV s runs deep  And thankfully so far I have not had any of the feared rollovers  I purchased this Gem in 12 00 for  22K   a steal in my opinion One bit of advice for SUV wannabees  Don t buy this vehicle or any other SUV if you are prone to radical highway driving or are prone to being distracted by chatting on cell phones with lovers  or using such fine vehicles as a dressing room while driving and especially if you prefer to drink while driving  don t buy a fine vehicle like this  If you do buy it keep both hands on wheel and treat it with the respect which it deserves Now the details  Mine is the 4door E  Bauer with all the gizmos  Leather  data display  digital memo  overhead console  rear sound system  rear a c control  keyless entry alarm  puddle lites  xenon lighting  16 FIRESTONE s  yes I trust em still  but I am on the list for replacement with Michelin Crossterrain just getting some mileage out of the Firestones first almost 46K so far on them  also have the roof rack and trailer package and electric everything  The only option  I think  not on this gem is the power moonroof and to be honest I don t miss it  I had one on the BroncoII and after a few years it began to have a persistent leak in rainstorms So if you keep vehicles longterm like I do skip the moonroof and eliminate the rainstorm possibility  My likes are many and dislikes are nil In the winter the Ford heating system is fast and strong in summer the A C is just as fast and strong  Road feel and comfort in the Explorer are vastly improved over my 86 BroncoII as well as power and towing capability  And when it snows I smile knowing that this beast eats snow for a living  One thing my BroncoII has over the Explorer is its capability off road The 86 had manual 5 speed with manual locking hubs and shorter wheelbase and was lighter as well  With its 2 9 V6 the BroncoII could run circles around the explorer on a muddy goat track  However in the Explorers defense I did recently travel  with two gals on board with all the camping equipment and luggage etc  to the Boardman river in the Per Marquette National Forest in Northern Lower Michigan We were definitely up a goat track more than 1 5 miles to the river bank where we set up camp  And let me tell you this Transport Tank Explorer did not even flinch  Surefooted and comfortable all the way with 10 disc cd changer to boot  How civilized a way to off road  Way to go Ford technical My 4 0 SOHC v 6 delivers and average 21MPG fairly consistently  I live on a dirt road in Howell MI and travel roughly 2 3 of the time on highway  So far  after 45 000 miles I have had no repairs of any kind no rattles no wind noises nothing but joy and bliss  I do ALL my own maintenance and I made sure to get the complete shop manual 2 book set tossed in when i purchased it from Ford  In the near term it looks as tho the brake pads will need to be replaced  45 50K miles not bad at all  and I may even upgrade shocks and toss in a tweaked computer chip to upgrade the standing start performance  As noted by many the explorer has adequate power for passing its off the line performance is a bit dull but hey  its a truck  whattaya want  Other than that I change the oil more frequently than the 10K interval and I check the tranny fluid levels almost whenever I check oil  Also I stay away from automated car washes preferring to powerwash myself and I frequently do  clean cars dont rust proof is my 86 broncoII I look forward to reporting back when this stallion hits 100 000 miles if you want a recommendation Jeep grand wagoneers have cramped foot space on both left and right front cowls  they have more road noise and just don t compare on interior or exterior appointments But they aren t Jeeps anymore since they are technically a Chrysler product Durangos  just plain cheap feel  GM blazer jimmy  bravada whatever  all the same tinny under powered rattling pieces of Detroit junk  The imports  all inferior way over priced copies of GMC and Chrysler products Buy American Buy Ford  Explorer Rocks Detroit Jon S Howell Michigan just north of Hell  MI
