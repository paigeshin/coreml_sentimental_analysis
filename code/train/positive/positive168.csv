 I wanted something that could haul anything  anywhere  and at anytime  At the same time  I wanted it to have a comfortable ride  and good handling  My Ford Explorer Limited has done all of this and more  I ve only had to do regular maintenance services  If I were to knock it  I wish it stood taller on the road  Mine is a 1995 and has performed better than I expected  I do wish utility vehicles got a little better gas mileage  The seats are comfortable on long trips  I m not beat up nor fatigued when I get to my destination  It s a nice compromise between a regular road car  van  amp  pick up truck  I d highly recommend one to any one looking for versatility  If you want a vehicle that will do many things besides get you there  you should definitely consider a utility vehicle  You won t be disappointed
