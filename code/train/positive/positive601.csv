 I recommend this vehicle for it s safety as well as it s comfort  My husband and I liked it so much after we traded it the first time we went back to Ford and got the same truck back  The only downfall on this truck is that if you have more than one child who is ultimately going to grow up quicker than you can imagine then you will need to get the king cab  I have two children and as they grow older it is getting a bit crowded in the truck  Other than that it is a wonderful truck  It stands up much better than the other models as far as breakdowns and best built  A few months ago I backed into a dodge  which my husband wasn t very thrilled with  but the Ford never even got a scratch on it  The dodge on the other hand was so weakly built that it just dented immediately  Even my insurance agent was shocked  Not a scrap on it  So if you re looking for reliable and durable the Ford F150 XL is the way to go br br
