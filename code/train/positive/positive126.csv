 I was able to drive this car for the past couple of weeks  when me and my brother decided to switch cars  He drove my 98  Mercury Mystique and I drove his 99  Ford Contour  I was very impressed with it s handle on the road and the little added horsepower that the Mystique doesn t have  I ve been driving the Mercury Mystique for the last year and have been pleased with the car  What really surprised me when I started driving this car is how similar it is to the Mystique  The interior is almost exactly the same and the feel of the car is also similar  So with that in mind price should also be compared  We paid about the same for the car  his being a year newer gave him the advantage  I think that Mercury Mystique is a special kind of ford manufacturer so you spend some money on the fact that it is a Mercury Mystique   Things about the car  comes with the nice anti lock brakes for all wheels power windows and door locks I think the Contour is the SVT  and in the 99  models that particular type of Contour has more horsepower 200 to the SE and LX s 125 it has a V6 engine  it has more torque than the other models also miles per gallon  which is  important  now adays  is 20 29  city hwy has cruise control and air bags seats now more than 5 comfortably  it is a very luxurious ride if I may say so it s a safe ride  even though it has more horsepower than the Mystique  the feel when you drive it makes it just as safe  It s hard to explain  other than it feels safe when you drive it brother bought it at about  13 000 I would recommend this car to parents who want a safe and dependable car for their children to drive  Also to people who do a lot of driving to work everyday  it s gets good MPG  Is it better than the Mystique  Even though they are two very similar cars  the added horsepower and cheaper price makes this car a little bit better br br
