 Ford has done its homework on the new 2001 Sport Trac  The Sport trac has the most front and rear seat room of any vehicle in it s class  Granted the other companies have done a great job  the Sport Trac is a step ahead of the rest  Negative coments about rear set leg room being cramped  this is far from the truth  Not only is there plenty of room for kids  an adult of 5 foot 11 inch has plenty of room for comfort  The bed is slightly shorter than other competitors but all you need to do is drop the tail gate and flip up the bed extender  With the optional extender  your bed is now a full 6 foot  With the ample 4 liter v6 you have plenty of power to pull your camper or boat  The standerd features here are options on other trucks  The rear power window is a great feature not seen anywhere else  Granted you are slightly limited on storage space behind the rear seat  just add your optional tonneau cover and you are ready for that trip to the beach  Ford you have done a great job on the new Sport Trac  It was so impressive  I bought the first one to arrive at Bob Dunn Ford br br
