 This review is written in memory of our late friend and fellow Epinionater  Mike Lambert  Roadiem Okay  let me be straight up front about this  Yes I am Australian  and no  the cars driven in the USA are not the same as here in Australia But there are strong similarities  The main Australian designed and built cars are little different from those used in the USA  So  how do I know Well  about 18 months ago I had to spend a week in the U S  and I sought to rent as similar a vehicle as possible to that that I drive and own here in Australia  The perfect vehicle for the role was the Ford Crown Victoria  even though the name conjures up the Queen  yuk  or a famous Australian beer  Since I drove one 1 800 miles around the U S  East Coast  without hitting one kangaroo  I feel qualified to report on it s virtues  And  try as I did  I found it impossible not to make some comparisons with Aussi cars   well sufferin snakes  I tried Apart from getting in on the right hand side incessantly  I found this vehicle to be near identical to my Aussi Ford Futura  That brings me to the only real fault in this car  and all USA cars   that being there is no warning to get in the left hand side if you want to drive it   its so damn embarrassing  jumping in the right side for a quick take off with nothing there Now seriously  to me and I suspect most people  a car is either working or its broken  so you won t be bored here with a whole lot of mechanical jargon However  I do know enough to realize the Crown does follow the near universal basics of medium and big cars  That is rear wheel drive and a penchant for effortless highway cruising while still being quite maneuverable enough for the rigors of big city traffic For the average motorist its obvious that these basics are still the preferred vehicle type  despite the plethora of mostly Japanese and Korean buzz boxes on offer in both countries Perhaps this is because both Australia and the USA are relatively large with long distance driving common  Things have changed a bit though  with US cars no longer having Football Field size trunks and engine bays big enough for a spare engine  resulting in much more compact designs compared to those of say twenty years ago Fuel consumption is no doubt the major reason  Here  by US standards  the Crown does quite well but there is substantial room for improvement since equal Australian cars do about twenty percent better  Perhaps the slightly cheaper fuel  due to differing Taxation  makes the difference While the Crown Victoria I rented drove extremely well  I was surprised to learn it still had the old solid axle type rear suspension instead of the newer Independent Rear Suspension or IRS  However  the two most important safety features  being ABS and Power Torque Control were standard  as would be expected  The debatable air bags that have swept the world are of course standard   They ll have the damn things on pushbikes next I noticed Crown Victoria s everywhere  so they must be high in the sales stakes  and surely that alone speaks for itself  I understand they are even the vehicle of choice of many if not most Government Agencies  including the Police This too speaks volumes for its usability and quality So thats what an Alien thinks of the Crown Victoria   in a nutshell this vehicle would hold its head high in any company as a practical  well priced family car with outstanding touring capabilities mixed with good city driving attributes I found it both easy and enjoyable to drive  the ultimate test of any vehicle  and I have no doubt it would be at the top of my list if I was a USA Citizen B The proceeds of this write off go to Mikes wife  in his memory  May he rest in peace B B This review is a joint effort between SMITHSWOODSIDE and LadyCynic whose personal generosity in this regard makes me cringe in disbelief   please also visit LadyCynic s site   Please read the other write off entrants listed below bjcuevas  napthalia  seether166  sherrylee  mattjoe  viper1963  gollygumdrops  noniaBidnis nightshade 01  obnox  Hawkseafan  Yyvonne diverpam  T Hall  mtuairau  jennifa  PPerky1954 hnnygrlca  rcknron3  MiDoyle  charlesnep  LatteChick  garfield12  bgoodday  chrisceb  alwaysstubborn nwinston  hirohito99  sweetcece  theworm ginahill  jpmcgurk  tiffer0220  juliette  elorraine  imames  pipet  sparkospunky  disartain  Linda527 Lisa J  lgcurcio yahoo  kristinafh  tgreenway  pambo  friskycelery  tjarnold  iculooking  todd  teddiec Darby Walters wolfman309  emeleel  joubert  technologyrep gamblinfamily
