 I am a proud owner of a Ford Explorer  I received this car about 3 years ago  and would not trade it for the world  An Explorer can fit tons of stuff in it  trust me I fill it to the brim everytime I go back to college  Not just things  but you can fit several people in there and still have a comfy ride  In fact the Explorer is so comfy  I can drive 4 hours without having to stop and stretch  The Explorer has electric seats  which makes it perfect for any size person to drive  because it so easy to adjust Gas goes a long way as well  granted it is expensive to fill up  but once you do you won t have to for a while An Explorer is dependable and sturdy  Over Thanksgiving I was rear ended by a car that was rear ended by a mack truck and there was no damage done  Rarely do I need to take my car in for anything other than an oil change  I know when this Explorer dies  the next car I will get will be an Explorer br br
