 Confession  I am a former member of the  I hate SUV  club  But  having three large dogs  a seven year old  a 19 foot boat that I trailer  a wife who does arts and crafts shows  as well as living in New Hampshire  I had to revoke my membership and take the plunge for what made sense   an SUV  I had driven an older 4 door Explorer and a 2000 Blazer  Both seemed cushy  had roll and lean when cornering and lacked any type of road confidence  I test drove the 01 Sport and was very impressed  The 01 Sport  it has more than adequate power  There are no rattles  which my 95 Taurus wagon specialized in  The vehicle seems solidly built  I love being so high up  Also  the vehicle drives with confidence  steering is responsive and it corners better than any truck I have been in  no roll or lean   Beware of overconfidence  The sound system is the best I have ever had in a vehicle  You do feel every bump on the road  and be careful of taking a corner above 45 where there are noticeable bumps in the road  But remember  this is a Truck  not a car  The ride is quite and on a flat surface  very comfortable  as are the FRONT seats  Mileage is around 19 all round  but this is a big 4 0 engine and not all that bad for its class  Oh yes  towing  I can t tell you how many times I could not haul my boat out due to low tides   Yes  I previously towed with a Taurus Wagon  which probably hastened its premature death  This truck is an awesome tower  It does not cease to amaze me how well this truck tows a 3000 pound rig  There is no strain on this truck at all  I am sure this 4 wheel drive monster will be great in the snow and off road  if you do that thing  I paid  16 900 for this 01 truck with 13k on it from a dealer  This may be the best vehicle value out there for my needs   haul the family  boat  art  dogs and family without mortgaging the ranch  As for the back seats  stop winning  you bargained for a 2 door and that is what you got  saving you a couple of thousand in the process and giving you a much better looking vehicle than the 4 door as well as adding a few miles per gallon
