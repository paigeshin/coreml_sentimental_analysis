 As a former employee of Ford  I found the Aspire as a wonderfully refreshing replacement to the Festiva  My first Festiva went about 18 000 miles before the rings came unseated  and blew the oil out The Aspire engineers have cured this problem  and I have the only GT Aspire that I know of  I was with Ford for 22 years  and can do just about anything that can be done to a car  mechanically speaking The Aspire has the 59 HP Festiva engine  otherwise known as a Mazda 121 Cosmo engine  and is set up to run on fuel that is subgrade to US unleaded  I decided to try an old trick of boring out the throttle body to increase the airflow through the engine  and got a little more than I asked for  The dyno gives me 64 HP with a decent highway mileage figure of 38 MPG  Therefore I stuck some  quot GT quot  logos on the lower front fenders  and added the FACTORY spoiler on the top of the rear deck The take off from redlights is a little bit better  but if you were looking for tire burners  get a Mustang  The Aspire is a great little car  equivalent with the Bug of the 60 s and 70 s  but with real seatbelts and airbags to boot  I have the intent to drive this car for a least 200 000 miles on the first engine and will periodically report the performance and cost of maintenance to  quot Little Red quot If you have any quirks to comment on  I m open for discussion I will try to share what I have learned from the parts books and mechanics  I have picked up a lot of info this way br br
