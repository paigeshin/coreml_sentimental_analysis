 The first time I saw a Ford Explorer Sport Trac  I knew I had to have one  Then I found out what they cost  But I waited a while and finally got one that was reasonably affordable and well equipped  Let me state right off that this is not a technical review  I am just going to tell you what I like and don t like about the vehicle First of all  if you want a vehicle that gets attention  this is the one  The Sport Trac is still rare enough that a large number of people do a double take when they see it and many will come up to you to get a closer look The thing that first attracted me to the Sport Trac was that I wanted a four door vehicle  but I also wanted a truck  I really did not like the looks of the four door pickups  The Sport Trac is a good compromise  We have found the interior to be quite roomy and have carried five people quite comfortably in the vehicle  However  I would state that I would not want to take a long trip with three adults in the back seat  The front seats are fairly comfortable  but the seats could do better in terms of lumbar support  The air conditioner works quite well and there is a vent in the center console for the back seat passengers  I tend to keep this shut off  however  as it is a little noisy  The 4 speaker am fm cd cassette player is a good one  I would rate the sound excellent  as well as the radio reception  The floor of the vehicle is rubber  but Berber carpet mats come with it  I like this feature  The rear window is a power window with three positions  closed  open  and vent  In the latter position  it is open about one inch  Instrumentation in the Sport Trac is attractive  I enjoy the thermometer in the center overhead console  Even though it looks as if the vehicle is equipped with gauges  this is a little deceiving  The oil pressure gauge is a disguised  idiot light  with only two positions The rear seats fold down to give additional cargo space  Unbeknownest to many  the rear seats lock in place  making for a more secure floor for packages  etc  Behind the seats is a minimal amount of cargo space for a few tools  a jack  and the like The Sport Trac is adequately powered  and my experience is that it handles quite well  One day a  less than attentive  driver pulled out in front of me  and I braced myself for the sound of metal against metal  However  I was able to negotiate the Sport Trac to avoid the other driver  So I rate it high on maneuverability  In terms of gas mileage  I get 16 18mpg around town  Although I have not been on a long trip yet  I believe I will get in the 20 21mpg range The ride is a good one  I would rate it quite comfortable  There is a little wind noise at higher speeds  The cargo bed is smaller than a regular pickup  but I have found it to be quite adequate  A fold out cargo cage is an option  This is a good way to extend the bed to about 6 feet  but I placed a hard cover on my bed and removed the cage  However  I installs and removes with a minimum of effort  There are numerous tie downs in the cargo bed  which makes it easy to secure a load  I have only had my Sport Trac for about 3 1 2 months  but I have had not trouble with it  All in all  I am pleased with my purchase and would definitely do it again
