 We purchased our 2001 F 150 SuperCrew on April 15th 2000 as soon as they hit the market  I could not ask for a better truck  Has all the space of a car with towing and hauling of a truck  The V 8 engine is more than able to pull my 14 ft cargo trailor  A great looking truck  I will purchase another one as soon as my time is up with this one  Ford has hit the jackpot with this one in my book  If you like big vehicles and the ride of a car buy this truck  My truck has a AM FM CD Player with surround sound  automatic with cruise  power windows and door locks  I did not purchase the extended gate that is a option on this vehicle  You have plenty of room through out the truck br br
