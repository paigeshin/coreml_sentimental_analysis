 I have owned my 2000 V6 Stang for 6 months now and am loving it more every day  What an awesome car  There really is just something about a Mustang  Especially one that is powerful  beautiful and sounds like thunder  I added about  600 in add ons to my stang   GT dual exhaust and a cold air intake   MAC Products   It was awesome before but now it s even better  It sounds and feels like a hot V8 and is quite a bit faster that stock V8 s of only a couple of years ago  I have owned 30 cars 2 of them were imports and I have had 2 transmissions go out out on those 30 cars  the 2 imports  American cars are just as if not more reliable than most imports plus you get style and great driving experience  Plus it would survive a wreck better most My 2000 Stang is the most awesome car to drive that I have ever owned and it only cost me  17 000  with leather plus  600 in add ons  About half the price of most comparably powered imports  I am not blind to the negatives though  Engine a bit noisey at higher rpm s but when blended with the rumble from 3 quot  dual exhaust it s just fine  Probably should get upgrade to 16 quot  or 17 quot  wheels from the V6 stock 15 quot  but not really necessary  I love the 5 speed and with it it weighs 270 lbs less than a GT with automatic and 240 lbs lighter than a V6 Camaro with nearly the same HP  GT s feel heavier and I know they would be awesome to own   and to upgrade   but for  3500 less money I ll stick with my nimble V6 and have fun upgrading it here and there  Supercharger  Who knows  maybe someday br br
