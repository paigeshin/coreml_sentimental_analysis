 There were really only two SUVs that I was considering  The Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford Excursion  After doing extensive research and test driving I realized that the Ford Excursion was in a class of its own  The Ford is safer and larger than the Suburban and was obviously designed with safety and capacity as a goal  I won t argue that the Suburban is a great 4x4 but if you test drive both  and can afford the gas for the Ford  I think you will also realize that the Ford is the better truck  I found myself stopped behind a Suburban at a traffic light when I was driving home from the dealer with my new Excursion and it was at that point that I realized how much larger the Ford is  I was blown away by the acceleration of the V 10 engine  it sure didn t seem like I was driving a 4 ton truck  This truck is meant for people who want safety  towing and cargo capacity and the great feeling of a luxury LARGE truck br br
