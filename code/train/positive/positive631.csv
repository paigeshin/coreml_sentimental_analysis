 After driving a car for the past 30 years  I decided to buy a truck  I investigated the RAM  Chevy 1500  GMC  and the F150 The RAM looked pretty good to me  but after a test drive I felt the truck was put together rather cheaply  Plus the dealers were rude and didn t know too much about the truck at all The GM products also looked pretty good  For some reason they wanted more money for a truck that didn t stand up to the F150 The F150 is good looking  build to last  and it was affordable  The only thing that I wish I had done was to get the 4X4  But  that was another  4 000 00  Never owning a truck before I felt the 4X2 was a good enough start in trucks I bought the V6  It has more then enough horse power  It sits up tall and I feel level with many of the 4X4s  It feels great looking above all the cars on the road  I can see traffic problems much sooner then any car on the road The only problem that I have had is getting use to the rear wheel drive and the rather light rear end of a truck  Didn t hit anything  just some close calls  But  that would have happened with any truck I ve had the truck for about a year and 1 2 now  and I love driving the truck over any car br br
