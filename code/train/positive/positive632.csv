 I have had my 98 F 150 from the moment it hit the lot  Since then I have put over 102 thousand miles on it  I have traveled all over the country  but primarily from South Texas to Canada  through the Rocky Mountains  Colorado  Wyoming  etc  Driven in all possible weather conditions  I have changed the oil  and performed service checks every time it comes around  I was concerned with the new transmissions that were placed in this truck  but have seen no problems yet  Ford did a great job improving and modifying the 96 transmissions  Not once have I had a problem  A few weeks ago  I took apart the engine to check the wear  and there was little or none to be seen  I am greatly impressed with this truck  It is very stylish and had no defects  The paint is holding up greatly  unlike the 80 s Aerostars that came out  It has maintained its smooth ride  and still out performs most chevys and dodges  unmodified  I have noticed no decline in performance over the years  Acceleration has always been great  Stereo sound is not that bad  considering it is factory  With the way my truck is running  I am sure it will last at least 1 000 000 miles
