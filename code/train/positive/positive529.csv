 I highly recommend this Ford Explorer  I own a 1997 XLT V 6 SOHC  I purchased this vehicle b c of its value  great engine performance  still has great pickup after 2 5 yrs  and had all the options I wanted without getting a lot of other useless features Driving this vehicle is very smooth  It has a relatively good turning radius  given its size  I have driven it in rain  great handling when going through mud puddles on the highways  snow  on the way to the mountains  ice  last Christmas  and it is very controlled  amp  responsive  Note this is an SUV so it doesn t corner as tightly as a car sport car  but the pros outweigh this con  also this is the same problem for other SUV s of this size When I was looking for an SUV  it looked for  a minimum of a V6  which shut out a lot of the smaller SUV s  power for the money  I looked at a Jeep Grand Cherokee but would have to get a V8 in order to get any pickup  it would ride high  as opposed to a Subaru  full time 4WD  so I wouldn t have to be changing back  amp  forth  thus discounted Toyota 4Runner  wide back seats  i e  the amount of room to get into the back seat  this discounted a Land Rover Discovery  you have to really twist in order to get into the back seat  lift glass in the rear door  would recommend the Explorer read door configuration  the same on a 97 Grand Cherokee  i e  it lifts up  so you can stand under it  which is quite nice in rainy Portland preferred the spare tire to not be in the cargo area I also required that the SUV has a Sun Moonroof  amp  CD Player Changer As a side note the stereo on this Explorer is very good  no clipping or distortion br br
