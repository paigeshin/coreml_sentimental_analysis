 This vehicle may not be for all people but if you tow a trailer and have children this vehicle is for you  The ride is firm but not horrible  It is built on the F 250 chassis so don t expect a Cadillac ride  I opted for the diesel which gets me 13 to 14 mpg around town and over 18mpg on the hwy while not towing  The fit and finish are excellent  The interior is quite comfortable and the stereo system is very good  Space for carrying things is second to only a van  I really can not say much bad about this vehicle  I will say that unless you own one  keep your opinions to yourself people  This is not a site for do gooders or moral opinions  People want the hard facts  Consumer reports gave it a lousy report but I think when reporting on a vehicle like this you can not compare it to the BMW or LEXUS suvs  Sure  it takes longer to stop  it weighs 7200lbs  Consider that is nearly 80  heavier than those two car like suvs and its braking distance is not bad by far  It has 4 wheel disk brakes  load range D tires  a class4 hitch and will tow 10000lbs  The diesel has plenty of get up and go and should satisfy most people  It is a bit noisy compared to the gas models
