 This past summer i bought my 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab off road truck  I am pleasantly surprized with it s options and handling ability  My truck is fully loaded with all the options and is manuel and i love it  It handles great on all the turns and since it is a V 6 i have plenty of power for all my needs  The 4x4 is great in the winter and whenever i am hauling or off roading  If you are looking for a truck that isn t huge but has all the power you would need  the Ranger is the way to go  The ride is quite smooth considering it is a pick up  The only downfall that i have found is that the seats in the extended cab area are tight  You surely would not want to make someone travel back there for long
