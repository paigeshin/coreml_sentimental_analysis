 My old tempo was on its last leg when our local Ford dealer was having a big sale  I looked around and picked out a 1995 Ford Escort LX  It was a year old when I got it  having a previous life as an Enterprise rental car  It had about 18 000 miles on it First of all I was surprised at how much pick up the car had  At first I thought that was just because my present car had virtually none  But it still has great pick up  even four years later  This is especially important when entering the highway from an entrance ramp I am able to accelerate quickly to enter at highway speed  It is always annoying when a car enters the highway at 35 mph The car gets very good gas mileage  At the time it was rated for about 35 mph highway 27 mph city  Depending on conditions  I find I can get even higher mileage than that  One particular trip I got about 45 miles to the gallon  Keep your car tuned up and you should be able to do as well  Using air conditioning lessons the mileage somewhat And speaking of air conditioning it works great  In fact  it gets cold and I have to turn the fan down to the first notch  Sometimes I even have to turn it off  I have never had a need to use the  quot MAX quot  air conditioning  Circulation of cold air in the back is a little more limited though  so if people in the front are cold  vents can be redirected to people in the back This car has an Overdrive gear  which improves the gas mileage even more  The car does have less power in this gear and it will automatically shift down if power is needed  such as going uphill  For short stretches it is okay to let the car shift automatically  For longer hauls  though  it better to downshift to drive  so as to not stress the transmission The interior is very roomy for a economy car  There is plenty of room in the front seat passengers  The seats are adjustable for taller drivers and riders  Headroom may be limited for people over about 6 ft 2 in  As long as the front seats aren t pushed back too much to accommodate taller riders  there is plenty of room for the average height adults in back  There is plenty of width for two back seat passengers  The four doors are more convenient for allowing entrance and exit of back seat passengers or for loading groceries and other stuff The trunk is quite roomy for such a small car  Room will be diminished however  when you replace the  quot donut quot  they call a spare tire with a real one  You can  however  still use that concealed space to store smaller items such as oil  jumper cables  etc  One neat feature is that the back seats fold down to connect to the trunk  In this way  longer items such as gardening timbers can be placed in the trunk without sticking out into traffic The car has what is called  quot passive restraints quot  This translates to automatic seat belts and air bags  The automatic seat belts are the type that drag along the frame of the window and lock in place as soon as the key is turned in the ignition  That secures the shoulder strap in place  The lap belt is separate  which is nice because you can then adjust it to fit your body  The air bags are contained in both driver and passenger side  Even with all the negative press on the potential danger of air bags  I am still glad they are there  Both these features give me a break on my car insurance  Another safety feature is that the rear windows will only roll down halfway  This helps ensure that children or pets do not fall out As part of the purchase price I bought an additional package for  250  This package entitles me to lube service at the Ford dealer for as long as I own the car  This service is provided at every 3 000 miles or every three months whichever comes first  I consider this a very good deal since a Fast Lube station will run about  30 a whack  I have more than got my money s worth out of this service Another thing I really like is the rack and pinion steering  While I can t technically tell you what that means  you will know if you don t have it  The steering is VERY tight  You move the wheel just a little bit and the car goes that way  This improves the car s maneuverability quite a lot  I find it easy to avoid idiotic drivers on the road as well as squeeze into a parallel parking space  A few weeks ago I had to fill in for our regular vanpool driver no rack and pinion on that van  The steering was so sloppy you could make almost a full half turn before the vehicle did anything  And every little bump jarred the wheels you had to keep a tight grip  Not so  on my nice little Escort About the only complaint I have is the warranty service  All three of the problems I had occurred within the first year  The first was a bent louvre in the dashboard  The whole dashboard was replaced since it is all one molded piece of plastic  For some reason that repair went smoothly and I did not have to pay a thing  But then I took it in because a clicking noise I heard while braking  It was about a  200 repair  I had to pay a  50  quot deductible quot  I understand this is a fairly common thing with car warranty s now  but even if it is I don t like it  After all  I have already paid a new car warranty of  800 when I bought the car  I don t feel I should have to pay anything else  Anyway  the problem was fixed The one serious repair I had to do was also  thank goodness  handled under warranty  Just had to pay the  50  but the repair was a  1 200 repair  The whole head had to be replaced  Something had come loose inside the engine and had worn a groove in the head  Though you might think this might be enough to turn me off the car it didn t  It made me pretty annoyed at the dealer  however  for keeping me waiting for three weeks  But actually  the car ran much better and seemed to have even more pick up and more power than before I still have the car and still love it  I should probably trade it in on something while I can get such low interest rates  But I can t bear to give up my car to get one of those new ones that looks like a colored squished marshmallow  well  maybe the Focus  not quite so round  My car is white with black trim  and blue interior  It s sporty looking  but not enough to attract the attention of police with radar  I would recommend it as an economy car and for couples  Though it could fit a family of four  there is probably not enough room if going on a long enough trip to need luggage  well  not without a rack on top br br
