 I bought my 91 Taurus from my parents because the prize was right and I knew who owned the car before me  I have had nothing but problems with this car  1  The light blue paint on the 91 Taurus is defective  It will rust leaving you with a nice tri colored automobile  2  The air conditioning is famous for breaking and for a mere grand  you can fix it  3  There is a problem with the motor for the windshield wiper so it can come on an off when you operate the turn signal  I have owned a 90 Taurus as well and encountered exactly the same problems  I will never again own a Ford Taurus  My parents recently purchased a 2000 Taurus and immediately it began making noises and the dealer essentially said  quot Deal with it quot  If you are looking for a reliable used car from the early 90 s  DO NOT buy a  90 or  91 Ford Taurus br br
