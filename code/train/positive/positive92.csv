 As soon as I saw this SUV I fell in love and I knew no matter how long it would take me to save the money for this beast  I had to have it  For one  it s truly a luxury vehicle  it has all the luxury options of a Lexus or BMW in a truck  It was when I drove it though that my love turned into lust and I couldn t get enough  I went to different dealerships every couple of weeks to  quot test drive quot  it  more like get my fix There are some things I d suggest getting on an Expedition 3rd seat  it s light and easy to remove and you ll be thankful if you ever need to take 7 other people somewhere Rear Air  those 7 other people will be thankful if you have it I enjoy the 6 disc CD changer  it s great for the music lover and you commuter s out there I think the Expedition looks a heck of a lot meaner with the 17 inch rims which in turn require the illuminated running boards  and last but definitely not least  do not  I repeat do not let any salesperson talk you out of the 5 4 liter engine  It s like the difference between a Ford Escort and a Mustang  No matter what other options you give up  get the larger engine br br
