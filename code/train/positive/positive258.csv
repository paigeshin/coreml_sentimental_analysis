  Note  I have not driven the 2000 Cobra R  Many people have criticized me and given me NR ratings for lack of personal experience  I have ridden in this car  and since there are only 300 of these cars in production  I feel my personal experience will suffice  I have a vast knowledge of this vehicle due to research  This and my love for this car is why I am writing this epinion  If you feel I deserve an NR for not driving this car  then that I will accept it  Thanks  hope you enjoy the review b To say the least  the year 2000 was an interesting year for Ford s Special Vehicle Team  SVT  With delays on the production of the 2000 Mustang Cobra because power outputs were lower than listed  SVT produced a limited edition of the 2000 Cobra which was given the glamorous name  Cobra R The most powerful Mustang automobile ever produced  the Cobra R brings awesome power and mean looks to the road  Because of limited production of the vehicle  only 300 were made  the prices have boomed past  50 000  Some people think it is crazy to pay such outrageous money for a Ford while others are willing to pay the premium to own such a majestic vehicle b Performance  The Cobra R packs a 5 4 DOHC V8 engine  This huge piece of equipment forced the redesign of the hood of the car just to fit this bad boy in the front of the car  The large bulge in the hood gives evidence to the size of this mammoth power house  Intake and exhaust ports were redesigned by SVT to improve the air flow for the car  Despite the rather heavy weight of this car  the 385 horses under the hood make this car zoom 0 60 in about 4 7 seconds and 0 100 in about 10 9 seconds  Due to the powerful engine and amazing aerodynamics of the Cobra R  the top speed exceeds 170 MPH  Exhaust on the Cobra R is also been modified greatly  Because of rear suspension and fuel tank complications  rear exiting exhaust pipes had to be voided  The car has side exiting exhaust tips directly in front of the rear wheels  This automobile also comes with a new 6 speed manual transmission as opposed to the standard 5 speed which comes with most Cobra vehicles b Suspension  The suspension in the Cobra R is rock solid  This is good and also bad  For track use  which is basically what the Cobra R is intended for  the Cobra R handles exceptionally  however  for road use  the rock solid suspension creates a rough ride  The Cobra R has a lowered ride height and 18 inch wheels wrapped in 265 40ZR18 tires   Exterior  The Cobra R s most noticeable features on the exterior are definitely the front racing air dam and the rear spoiler  Both body pieces give the automobile a definitive look as well as the look of a mean racing machine  The 300 Cobra R s produced are all the trademark color of red  When I first saw one of these cars at a fairly large Ford dealership where I live  I was in awe  There is a majestic aura about this car that is difficult to explain  maybe it s the fact that only 300 of these vehicles exist or maybe it s the combination of beauty and power  Being a huge Mustang fan  I believe this car is stunningly beautiful  I actually got my friend who works at the dealership to take a couple pictures of me and the Cobra R b Personal Experience with the Cobra R  I have a friend who works at the SVT licensed Ford Dealership in my town  I convinced him to let me come in and ride with him in the Cobra R  he wouldn t let me drive it  Being a huge fan and having read every known article on the Cobra R  I took this opportunity without a second thought  When he started up the car  I was amazing at the ear pleasing sound which resonated from the exhaust pipes  I have always thought that Mustang s have great sounding engines  but all I can say about the Cobra R exhaust tone is  quot Wow quot  Although we only were in the car for a minute or two  it was amazing  When he hit the gas  I was awestruck with the power of the engine  I literally was pinned to my seat  The ride was slightly rough  but I could care less  The Cobra R is truly an All American sports car b Other notes about the Cobra R  Most people who know some information on this vehicle know that this car comes without an air conditioner and a radio  The car is strictly a racing vehicle  not for every day driving  Because of the rarity of this car  prices have gone over  70 000  the Cobra R I rode in went for  74 000  SVT Ford has created a legendary special edition of a classic car  The Cobra R is truly an amazing vehicle that I would love to even be able to see another one in person again  The Cobra R is a pure muscle car which is probably owned by people who have money to burn  One thing is for certain  if I had the money  I would definitely do what I could to get my hands on the 2000 SVT Cobra R br br
