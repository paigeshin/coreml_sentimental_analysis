 Bought a Ford Contour SE  January 1999  Decided to take it on vacation to Maine  We are from Branson  Missouri  The Contour was very economical  comfortable and a joy to ride and drive  The spunky 4 cylinder engine took the turnpikes like the big boys  Was really impressed with the acceleration onto the ramps  The design of the windows lets you view a lot of the outdoors  which also made it very enjoyable  I would recommend a Contour to anyone who appreciates economy  smooth ride  and sorta of a sporty look  I feel the  s certainly out number the  s  One of the  s is that there was some road noise  not really irritating  but had to turn the radio up louder than I m used to playing it  and another was the airbag light malfunctioned  We drove from eastern Pennsylvania to home in one day  16 hours and because of the comfortable ride we arrived home not too tired and not at all beat up from the long drive  Ford Contour you have my vote and also my next vehicle will be a newer Contour Dwight Rogers  Branson  Missouri
