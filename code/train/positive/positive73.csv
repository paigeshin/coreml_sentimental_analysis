 My family and I own two Aerostars and we just love them We have three kids and need the extra room if we are going on a trip or to the grocery store My husband have also hauled many things with these vans  He used to work as a service tech for a window company and had to haul 3 hundred pound windows around for some of the services  He now works for a plumbing company and hauls pipe everywhere  We have had little trouble with these vans  The biggest problem we have had is a Transmission leak The vans are still running and one has over 150 000 miles on it and the other one has over 200 00 miles on it  These have been some of the best cars that we have owned and we got them both used  I could only hope that all the rest of the cars that we own are this good br br
