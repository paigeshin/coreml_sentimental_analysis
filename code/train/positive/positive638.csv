 My grandmother gave me this 1998 Ford Taurus brand new   a pleasant surprise and a wonderful blessing  It probably would not be one that I would have bought myself  but it has definitely been a good car  Shortly after I got it I moved up north and had to learn to drive in the snow  It was very reliable and I have since safely moved back home with not a ding on it  That was better than I hoped for  cuz I knew this southerner did not know a thing about driving in the white stuff   and there was a lot of it  too I have now had the car almost 3 years and in 42 000 miles its only been in the shop 2 times  I do not consider that excessive  One time was an ignition switch and the other was something with the power steering  The ignition problem was while it was still under the original warranty  The ignition switch problem did leave me stranded as it gave no warning   just died  But  since it hasn t happened again  I ve forgiven the car its indiscretion of breaking  The car has had reasonable gas mileage   about what it says on the sticker  I find it quite comfortable to drive as well  A Taurus is not a flashy car  but it is very utilitarian and that s good too  I think the trunk is a nice size I don t have a complaint in the world about this car for what it is   a car to get you around reliably  Its not sporty or anything  but it is a good car
