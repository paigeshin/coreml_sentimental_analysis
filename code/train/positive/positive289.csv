 I ve been driving a 2000   6 cylinder  4 door  4wd Explorer for six months now  So far it has its ups and downs  The ups  you sit higher and get a better feel for the road  it reacts quicker than most vehicles because of its short wheel base  plenty of room to stretch my big feet  The downs  although better than some SUVs it drinks gas like a dog on a hot day  the interior is fairly noisy  it is not the ideal choice for towing large loads The instrument panel is put together very well  It is easy to read and everything important is exactly where you want it to be  The back seats fold down easily to make an eight foot bed  Plenty of room for spreading out a sleeping bag I wish it had a cable release for the back window  The back door  which lifts up  has a glass that can also be opened up  Ideal for putting small items in the back without having to put all you weight into shutting the big door  This window lacks a release from the inside  You have to open it from the back door I titled this review  quot Explod er quot  because of the tire incident this past summer  I believe you should really look hard at this vehicle before buying it  The Explorer certainly fits some lifestyles  but for others there are better vehicles br br
