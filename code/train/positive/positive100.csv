 Ford Explorer Sport provides a perfect blend between sport utility capability and practicality for everyday use  While smaller SUVs lack the weight  size  and 4wd ability  larger SUVs sacrifice fuel economy and drivability  For instance  a Honda CRV is not nearly as well suited for rough terrain and or snow  With a structure that is derived from the Honda Civic economy car  it is nowhere near as durable and imposing towards bad weather  On the other hand  a larger SUV  such as a Ford Expedition  or even a 4 door Chevy Blazer for that matter can make a driver feel disconnected to the road and make one nervous when trying to maneuver these battletanks around crowded city streets  With the back end somewhat shortened over 4 door models  one might expect a significant problem with cargo space  This is not the case  Explorer Sport has plenty of space to hold several pairs of skis with the rear seats folded down  Also  visibility is a strong point of Explorer Sport  Pillars are arranged in a manner that cuts down of blind spots fairly well  The Ford Explorer Sport offers a great deal of strong points  not the least of them value  About the only complaint that I have with this car that offers incredible build quality is that the base motor is uninspiring  Go with the 4 0 SOHC as opposed to the OHV model  The extra 30 horses is a definite plus  particularly if towing is in your plans  All in all  though  I have nothing but praise for this well built  capable truck that offers a great blend of four wheel drive ability and normal day drivability br br
