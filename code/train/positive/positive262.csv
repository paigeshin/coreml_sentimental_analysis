 I purchased my Probe SE  5 speed  used  in 1998 with 53 000 miles  Up until a few weeks ago  she was going strong at 198 790 miles  I drove her hard  fast  and rough  Only had to replace the O2 sensors  Airflow sensor  and tires Great ride  fun road tripping car  and handled very well in all kinds of weather Only drawback was the price on replacement parts  To replace an O2 sensor  retail price from the dealership was  300 each  and both need to be replaced when one goes out   pricy  600 for a set of sensors  Airflow sensor was  300 retail price from dealership as well  This did not include labor  so unless you want to put them in yourself  these are costly The design lacked in handling tire blowout  I had to retire my baby after she was totaled beginning of this month  I had Cooper Cobra tires on the car  when the front driver s side tire split  causing the entire front fender  front quarter panel  side panel  undercarriage panel  and door panel to become squashed as if I d run into a pole  requiring complete replacement if I d decided to pursue restoration  Also the electric wiring shaft was severed  causing the car to lose power while driving 70 mph on a curvy interstate  The entire car would ve had to be re wired  The cost for the panels start at  2000 a piece to replace with upper cost of the door panel to  2700   these are after market value prices  The damage was caused due to a poor design in handling tire split  Granted  sports cars are not meant to handle these situations beautifully  but having made minor design changes could ve prevented some of these damages Overall  I ve never had such a great car run so well with so many miles  I m sure she would ve kept going for another good 40 000 miles easy  All parts  excepting for the sensors mentioned above and the tires  were stock and still going strong I d recommend this vehicle for someone who performs regular maintenance on the Probe and loves to drive long distances
