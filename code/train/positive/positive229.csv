 My 1987 Ford Taurus GL station wagon was purchased new in Columbus  Ohio  This vehicle has been a very solid  reasonably reliable hauler  The large and versatile cargo area adds incredible utility  enough to fit a full sized bicycle without taking the wheel off  The car is comfortable to drive  and the handling is really outstanding for its day  Remember  this is the car that saved Ford and wowed the world with its Audi class handling and driving dynamics in 1986  The 140HP 3 0L Vulcan V6 is rock solid  but delivers tepid acceleration  Brakes  no ABS available  are no better than adequate  but the car handles predictably even in adverse conditions  We ve used Goodyear Aquatreds  which certainly help in the wet and snow  Highway ride is pretty good up to about 75MPH  after which things become loud and jiggly  The speedo only goes to 85  after 16 years  this is not a speeder Reliability and durability have been surprisingly good  BUT  this is a Ford  and keeping up with maintenance is important or it ll come back to bite you  Long term problem areas include  alignment issues  tires wear out rather fast in this heavy front drive car  issues with random stalling   but it always started up again immediately or within minutes  and coolant system problems  The car is not happy in continuous stop and go city traffic  and can overheat and spill coolant  Rust is a big factor in the older vehicles  stay ahead of it  or it will attack doors and rear wheel wells  Original generation Tauruses are said to have problems with A C and transmission  A C no problems  but rarely used  but transmission has slow leak after 140 000 miles   and I think could be busted up much faster under hard acceleration  Good news  parts are cheap and plentiful  Insurance costs are low  The wagon has been used to tow a 1000lb  trailer without issue Personally  I think the original 1986 1995 models are the best looking wagons ever produced  the smooth  proportionate  aerodynamic shape influenced EVERY car produced since  This car is still good looking after 16 years   people are amazed when I tell them how old it is  These days  a 1987 Taurus can be a good choice for either a durable  inexpensive beater or a piece of American automotive history NOTE  My car has low miles  140 000 over 16 years  regular maintenance  and easy driving style
