 I recently bought my ranger from a used car dealer  I love it  It has the 4 0 liter V 6  It goes through tires with me like I drink water  It has enough bed space to haul just about anything you can think of  This truck is two wheel drive and it cranks out power  They are relativly easy to work on  I have hauled a 24  Rabalo with it  The down side is the space you have on the inside  I f you are clostraphobic  Get an f 150  I am 5  and have no room  Other than that  I LOVE MY TRUCK br br
