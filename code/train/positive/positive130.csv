 This car is a GT Premium  which has 260 horsepower as advertised  It is above the standard model  but it s about  3 800 more than the base model  My  1 recommendation  pay the extra money for the GT if you can  it s worth every penny and then some Power acceleration  The acceleration in this car is quite phenomenal  I m more than happy with it  I ve added an American Thunder cat back exhaust system to give it a really cool growling sound under open throttle  It has more horsepower because of the modification Handling  I am very happy with this rear wheel powered vehicle  Keep in mind this version of the vehicle has 17  performance tires  That surely improves handling significantly above the standard trim level  I ve hugged some tight curves with excellent grip on the road  On dry pavement  the handling is excellent  On wet pavement  care must be taken  Spinning the tires is fairly easy during heavy rain  when accelerating onto a highway  Beware of your usual high speeds when turning in wet rain  and leave plenty of space ahead for braking  Breaking on dry pavement is very good  the 4 wheel anti lock disk brakes had been used in an emergency situation once  with maximum sustained pressure  and they lived up to their expectations  Deceleration from 50 0 on a tight curve was better than expected  Maintenance and Upkeep  After 8 000  I am very happy  There s no major or minor problems to date  Only time will tell  Keeping the zinc yellow clean is more challenging  but it is well worth it  it s an outstanding color and gets noticed  I wonder how long my clutch is going to last  I surely make it suffer when I have fun with the car  It s doing good so far Gas mileage  The gas mileage can average as low as 14 5 MPG during a week with above average traffic problems  I drive about 3 4 city  1 4 highway  and the average MPG per tank goes up to about 17 5 18 when there haven t been significant traffic problems on the commute  Surprisingly  the cruising MPG  averaging about 65 for 1 000 miles  I received 26 27 MPG  That was a pleasant surprise  If you want to take advantage of the full power of with this car  your gas mileage will suffer gt  it s unavoidable  but it s never gone below 14 5 MPG for me Comfort and interior  I m definitely used to the black leather seats and power everything  My dog loves the back seat  If I expected to have 2 or more adult passengers regularly  I would not purchase this vehicle  The rear view mirror is slightly obscured by the spoiler  and the side mirrors are slightly obscured by the body form in the back  it took some getting used to backing up into a parking spot  Climate control is fine  and the 400 watt stereo is very clear at the maximum volume level  which is awesome  The ride is not overly uncomfortable for a sports car  I love the feel of control obtained from a sports car  as opposed to the floaty feel of comfort and luxury vehicles  The road needs to be felt when drying hard and fast Price  The price I paid includes all taxes and fees   24 000 for the GT Premium  that deal was through carsdirect com  which  by the way  provided fine service and stuck to their price
