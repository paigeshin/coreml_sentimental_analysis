 I recently purchased a 1992 Explorer  December  and have loved it  I was looking for a SUV  but because of financial restraints  my options were very limited  I have a taste for quality  so i couldn t settle for an old or bad looking vehicle  especially because of the size of a car investment  My choice on this explorer was great  Now  to get to the car  I would like to say that it has tons of room  both in the front seats  back seats and rear cargo space  It is very comfortable and with all automatic features  it couldn t be more simple  The seats  mirrors  windows and locks are all automatic  When looking at other SUV s of it s relative size  one overlooked feature that I have found to be very convenient is the option on the tailgate for opening either just the glass or the whole door itself  It makes quick trunk exchanges very simple  It has so far been very maintenance free  I have had it for just over 5 months now and it has not been to the shop once  With 68 000 miles on a sport utility  that is not bad  And the price was great too  Oh yeah  and not to forget the four wheel drive feature  This too is activated with the push of a button  making the shift quick and easy for the emergency situations  The room inside with all the convenient features make this SUV a great purchase for anyone  whether it be a family or just someone who likes the extra space for cargo or other needed use looking for comfort and space
