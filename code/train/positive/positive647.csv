 About 6 months ago  I purchased a brand new 2001 ZX2 right off the lot  and since then I ve learned a whole lot about cars  including one thing  This car tricked me into buying it  It has a sleek  sexy exterior  as well as a playfully agressive stance that looks very sporty and fast  The interior has very comfortable seating  and the 4 cyl Z Tech engine peels this little car off the line every time you floor the gas  But if you re looking for a contender in the sports car class  this isn t it  Don t let it trick you too  Those of you who are interested in building a hot street racer or just tricking out your car for fun should definately get this car  There is room for improvement in all areas  and if you re seen driving this car with some hot ground effects on it  you ll definately turn heads  because not many parts are out for the ZX2  If you really want something that can talk the talk and walk the walk from off the lot  then you might want to consider another car  such as the VW Jetta or the Honda Prelude  However  if you re looking for a beautiful and affordable ride that looks and feels sexy and sporty  but won t get you a ticket  this is the car for you  I bought the ZX2 because  at the time  I just wanted something new  fully loaded  and affordable  and this is what I ended up with  In retrospect  I would have much rather invested my money in something with less extras and more horses  If the Ford Mustang were a bar of soap  the ZX2 is what it would look like after about 10 uses  I think everyone looking for a new  sporty and affordable car should at least give the Escort a test drive  It s such a well rounded 4 banger for the price that it s hard to form an opinion for or against the car  You ll just have to go see for yourself
