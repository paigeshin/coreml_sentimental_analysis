 My first car was a Ford  One of those old  clunky  ugly suckers  It ran like it looked  My second new car also was a Ford   OK  I m a slow learner  It was a Mustang  new  fast  pretty  And prone to Cruise Control Collapse  sudden unexplained acceleration  that would send it from 20 to 90 while you were pulling in to park against a big  solid stone building or wall  Ford   Found on Road Dead  Henry s descendants certainly earned this moniker during the 1970s and 1980s  Their cars were pretty awful and the Japanese were eating their lunch for a reason But  come the 1990s  they seem to have redeemed themselves in one area  the Taurus Why  you ask  did I buy a third Ford after getting enough lemons to open a lemonade stand  I read good reviews  the dealer made me a real deal  and when I rented one  the rental agent had no other choices than Fords  so I had a forced test drive situation here  I loved it So  I bought one  It s a 1999 SE and it s mahvelous  It s comfortable  a major consideration when you drive as much as I do  It fits me  also a major consideration when you re 5 foot 9 from the waist down and 6 foot 5 from the waist up  It handles well and corrects without sending you off the other side of road  another big plus when your drive as unwell as I do In short  the Taurus makes up for Ford s past miscues and has turned me from a Japanese car fan back to a Ford lover At least until success goes to the head and they screw it up br br
