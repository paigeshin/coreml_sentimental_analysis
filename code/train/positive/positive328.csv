 We purchased the Expedition XLT Sport edition in Jan 2000 upgraded engine  cloth seats  upgraded running boards  6 disc CD player We have 4 kids  3 of which are still in some form of carseat booster seat  So  when we went shopping for a larger vehicle  one major requirement was being able to seat 3 carseats alongside one another  without any complications  In many cars  vans  and even some SUVs  it s almost impossible to do that without having one carseat pushed up against the other to the point where the seats don t sit evenly  Amazingly enough  we were able to put all 3 carseats in without any trouble at all The other problem we faced was my husband   his height  He s 6 6  That leaves a lot of cars out of the running because he s either scrunched up in the driver s seat  with his knees hitting the steering wheel  or his head is hitting the interior ceiling Personally  I favored the design of the Dodge Durango  but alas  my husband s head not only hit the ceiling  but if it had had a sunroof  his head would ve been out of the car After looking at the Fords  I really wanted the Excursion because of the extra storage space  but my husband was concerned about the gas mileage  Moot point in the end because he works from home  therefore  no commute  We only spend about  40 a month on gas  price being about  1 60 gal in N  Calif  because we only drive places a couple times a week as a family We solved the space issue in the Expedition by folding down the two middle row seats  leaving the 3rd seat behind the front passenger seat up  and being used  then placing the other 3 kids in the back row  This freed up a bit more usable area for groceries or the stroller Overall  I ve been happy with it I like the fact that the driver s seat is adjustable  as are the brakes  because I m only 5 5  It s been an easy vehicle to drive  unlike some of the minivans I ve owned before  ie  Dodge Grand Caravan   the Pontiac Transport  and it actually doesn t drive like a large vehicle My only real complaint is the lack of storage if you are putting more than 5 people into this car  I still think that once we re ready to trade this vehicle in  I m going to push for the Excursion or possibly a Suburban
