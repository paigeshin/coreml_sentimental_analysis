 The F 250 is a great work truck  its also a great family truck  It has many options which include  Power windows and door locks  Quad Cab  four doors  Bed cover  Cd Player  Four Wheel Drive It is easy to work everything in this truck  Its roomy in the front and the back  It has a very smooth ride  This truck can tow a good sized travel trailer or a good sized horse trailer  I love the Four wheel Drive I probably have over 1 000 miles of four wheeling in this truck and I have never gotten stuck  Its a good truck for people who want the towing ability and also the roomy cab  It is big so I wouldn t recommend it for people who feel insecure about big vehicles br br
