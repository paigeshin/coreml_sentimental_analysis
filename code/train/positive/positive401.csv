 The new generation ford contiues in the greatness of the ford line  The new styling is both aggresive yet civilized  The standard engine the V6  is still very powerfull but to opt for the 260 horse power V8 in the GT is a worthwhile purchass  The convertable has no problems  No leaks or tough situations for up or down movement  The mustang has incredible road manners  With plenty of power and tourque it has passing power on the highway  And a great drive through country winding roads  The car handles quite well for seating 4 adults  The two in the back are a little uncomfterble The trunk space is quite large because of the hatchback design of the car  Holding about  8 on the skidpad is a very good score  The mustang is a car that can be owned by anyone  For the exectutive or the person just looking for some style  The only down side to the mustang is its rear wheel drive  In the winter snow can cause a small problem  but wiht the available traction control deep snow is the only problem  The mustang is a great car for anyone  And with a low sticker price and high performance rating it is a great deal
