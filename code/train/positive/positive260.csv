 I bought this 2000 Explorer XLT as a replacement for my 1997 GMC Jimmy  I wanted a new Explorer but my Jimmy was a piece of junk  see review on it  and I spent a lot of money and I had to buy what I could afford I purchased this Explorer at the local GMC dealership with 34 600 miles on it  I have put about 1 000 miles on it so far and I have had nothing but good service  When I purchased my Explorer  it had new General tires on it  I like the feature content such as rear air and radio  compass  CD player  and power equipment  I also like the rear wiper washer  the running boards  and the fog lights  The engine and the transmission are powerful and perform smoothly The gas mileage isn t great but it s an SUV and the mileage is just as good as that of my Jimmy was  I know some people say Explorers aren t stable even with tires other than Firestones but my Explorer seems very stable
