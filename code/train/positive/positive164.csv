 I was very skeptical about buying a mini van  Once I test drove the Ford Windstar 1998 model  I knew it was the mini van for me  I bought the Windstar because of the price and because of the five star safety test  I have three kids so I need lots of room for soccer balls  book bags and other things boys collect  I would have to say that Windstar has tons of room on the inside  The back seat folds down fairly easily and there is tons of space behind the back seat to store a stroller and groceries  I haven t had any problems with my Windstar so far but I highly recommend it
