 My reason for considering the EXCURSION was its size primarily  The ones I had looked at seated at least eight  When I test drove it  the ride was smooth and controlled  I have had it now for about two weeks and it is the best vehicle I have ever owned  All the instruments are within reach and I am a very small female  The seats are adjustable and heated  The space is incredible  The kids love it  The leg room is ample enough for adults to sit VERY comfortably all the way to the back bench seat  I traded in a 1998 Toyota Forerunner  Limited  for it  That was a great car too  but it didn t ride half as smooth on the road as this vehicle  One thing to watch is how long it is on the nose and on the tail  It was a bear to park the first time  but I have the hang of it now anyone who has several people to drive about needs this vehicle  It is heads and shoulders above the Suburban  First of all  it is bigger  more beautiful  and a better bet as far as towing capacity  It can tow up to 10 000 pounds Great buy  I got mine a Limited with leather seats for around  37 000 br br
