 First let me say that as a rock star  I object to the stereotypical view of people who own pickup trucks as rednecks  I am on the cutting edge of music and fashion  and I ve never owned a pair of boots in my life  That said  I must tell you that the 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab is the perfect vehicle for a young musician such as myself  The bed is plenty big enough for all of my band s equipment  There s more than enough power to haul it all around the southeastern US  The cab is quite roomy  and the four door option makes it easy to lure 16 year old girls into it  The stereo is great  mine came with cassette and cd players  The outside appearance is sport enough to say  hey  I ve got style  but humble enough to not attract too much attention  I got the step side model  which I think looks really cool  almost as sexy as me Living in an urban area  you d think I d have trouble parking a 4x4 pickup  not so  Even though it s big enough to haul anything I could put in it  it s small enough to park anywhere I ve recomended this truck to all of my friends  Three of them took my recomendation and are now as happy as I am with it
