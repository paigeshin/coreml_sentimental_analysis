 Some of you might have read my previous post on the Ford Taurus  Some might not have  Right now I m at my wit s end I took my 1999 Ford Taurus SE to the shop for warranty work  The vehicle has 10 000 miles on it Quality used to be Job One at Ford  I d say that s the least of their concerns right now One of the warranty issues I have with Ford is the display on my car stereo blinks on and off  The radio worked fine  as far as sound went  but the visual display had a short or something in it  I thought taking it in and having it fixed would be a simple task  Unfortunately  I was wrong They kept my car for eight days  They said they couldn t just change out my radio for a new one  Ford requires they send the old radio to the factory for repairs At the end of the eighth day  the dealership contacted me to say my car was ready  and to come pick it up  I went ahead  picked the car up  sat down in the driver s seat  put the key in the radio  and there was no display for the radio  In fact  not only was there no display  but now the sound didn t work at all  The radio was a piece of dead hardware I immediately got the service advisor over  and asked why Ford didn t check to see if the radio was actually working before they sent the radio back  They didn t have an answer for me  and said that was stupid of Ford to do that I thought things would go well  and Ford overnighted the radio over and had it repaired  then overnighted the radio back  I was called today and told to come pick the car up I turned on the radio  the car seemed to run fine  Fifteen minutes out of the dealership  the radio died once again I returned to the dealership  who told me that they would once again have to send the radio BACK to Ford  and have Ford work on it again  I inquired why I can t get a new radio  figuring the car is only a few months old  and they said that s not Ford s policy  and they can work on the radio as many times as needed until the problem is resolved Meanwhile  I m renting a car once again  at  29 99 a day  my dime  Ford doesn t provide loaners unless you purchase their extended warranty  while Ford keeps tinkering with my car stereo instead of replacing it It would seem to me that to keep a customer happy  Ford would have just exchanged the radio after a few attempts to fix it with no avail  However  rules are rules  and the customer is set at the bottom of the food chain I would suggest you keep this in mind before purchasing a Ford product  There are many manufacturers out there that guarantee you a free loaner without purchasing the extended warranty while the car is in the shop for warranty work br br
