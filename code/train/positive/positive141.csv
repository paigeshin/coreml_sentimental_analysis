 We live on a farm and purchased a big truck in order to pull a horse trailer to transport our horses  cows and or sheep as well as haul feed for them  I buy a ton at a time  We also needed it to pull a car trailer for our antique and classic car collection  At first I was intimidated by this monster of a truck  being a small woman  But once you get used to it I think anyone would enjoy driving this truck  It has a lot of power and rides very smooth  It handles very nice and makes you sit up so tall you can t help but to feel powerful  Ours has a v 10 in it and I wouldn t want anything less  I really like the power br br
