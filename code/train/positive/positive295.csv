 I ve recently purchased a 2000 Ford Windstar LX  We traded in our 1996 Windstar and are very pleased with the refinements that Ford has continued to make to the Windstar with each successive model year Ford was a little late in adding the  fourth sliding door  option and quite frankly they were probably caught a little bit by surprise when Chrysler introduced this innovation to the minivan market a couple of years ago  But while Chrysler and GM were adding the additional door Ford was continuing to place an emphasis on Safety and Ride Quality  The Windstar is the only Domestic Mini Van with a 5 Star Collision rating and for the year 2000 side impact air bags are an option  The Windstar is adequately powered  however  you pay dearly for the additional boost in the anemic gas mileage you ll get  The Windstar has a decent road feel but steering can at times feel vague  But the Windstar is relatively easy to maneuver  is quiet and is quite pleasant to drive and ride in  The Captains seats are well padded and comfortable and are quite improved from earlier models  The 6 way power driver s seat option with lumbar support adjustment is highly recommended Also  optional is on the LX is remote controlled automatic passenger s side sliding door  This is a great convenience when toting small children  Ford also offers a premium sound package with a CD player as an upgrade for about  300  The sound is exceptional for a factory installed system  Also  recommended is the rear heat and air option  This allows all passengers to ride in comfort The styling on the 2000 model has also been refined  The front end is more rounded  imitating Chrysler s styling initiatives  But on the plus side this also seems to have improved visibility over the front nose of the van  Next time your in a parking lot look at all the bent front license plates on earlier Windstar models  Due to poor visibility over the nose  Windstar drivers were are constantly hitting parking rail guards  A minor irritation becomes evident in rainy conditions you ll notice that the rear window wiper only seems to clear about half  the driver s side  of the window  While I personally didn t have any problems with my 96 model  my sister had some of the renowned Windstar problems with her 95 model  head gasket  electrical  and has vowed never to purchase another Ford  However  from the group of people I know she is the only one to have serious problems with the Windstar  Chrysler and GM have had there own share of problems  mainly transmission related with their minivans  If you are in the market for a Minivan and Safety and Comfort are a priority I d highly recommend that you test drive the Windstar  I think you ll agree that it compares quite nicely to its competitors br br
