 Its just a great  reliable little car  We commute 600 miles a week and have 115 000  miles on this four year old car and she s still running strong  In all those miles  we ve only spent about  1500 in maintenance on her  We tried to run her out of oil on a trip to Canada  keep forgetting to get the oil changed  don t get her washed enough  but she still keeps going  Very comfortable  even for 2 larger people in front  Run medium grade gasoline in her and she s very peppy on the highway too  Even with all those miles  our Escort still averages 30 MPG with an even mix of highway travel and in town traffic  We d definitely buy an Escort again and plan to stick with Fords in general in the future br br
