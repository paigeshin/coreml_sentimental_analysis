 My husband recently traded our 1996 B4000 Mazda for a 4 door Ranger V 6XLT 4wd  We loved the Mazda but it was getting lots of miles on it and wanted something new  The Mazda and Ford are the same vehicle basically and we knew we had good luck with the Mazda for years The controls are exactly the same  and I mean exactly  This is fine since everything is laid out well and is good quality  Several things have changed on the inside like the steering wheel is a little thicker which is more comfortable  This truck has 4 doors  but not full size doors that make you lose bed space  They make it easier to store things behind the seat as well as being easier for passengers to get into the back  The back is still not the most comfortable spacious ride  but it s okay for short trips  I personally don t like the seats sitting sideways in the back as it can make you feel sick on twisty roads  but we don t use them much We had one bold break and one loosen frequently on the armrest in the Mazda  They have since added bracing on both sides of the armrest which makes it much more sturdy  There is also an airbag turn off switch for when you need to have children ride up front  He got the single CD stereo which has very good sound and easy to read buttons The biggest and best change is the engine  It s the same size but more HP with more get up and go  It s also geared differently  manual  where you can be in a higher gear at a lower speed which has been a good thing with all of the snow and ice we ve had  The 4wd is great and can take you anywhere you want to go  It rides like a truck because it is one  but the ride in the new one is much tighter and takes the bumps a whole lot better One thing I don t like is the programmed keys  They are  25 plus  25 for programming if you have them do it  We bought 3 extra keys and programmed our own but it was pretty scary because we didn t want to mess it up and have to have it towed 40 miles to the dealer  It was pretty easy though  It s supposed to make it harder for thieves and is considered an alarm system It s a good truck that has been relatively unchanged for many years which shows that it is an idea that works No new trucks seem to come with a bedliner and I m quite sure why seeing how expensive the trucks are and they save the paint  We got a bedliner installed by them and it s very nice br br
