 When I started  looking  for a new auto I became  focused   no pun intended  on the specification and configuration requirements that were important to me  Now  to tell the truth  I may be a little biased as I generally like Fords and would only consider Subaru as a Japanese auto but  nevertheless  I still made it my mission to be informed about all autos that met my criteria  Out of the  models  that I narrowed it down to   the Subaru Forrester  03  only came with an  unremarkable  power source  the Subaru Impreza WRX kind of suited me but I was a little concerned about the interior room  this was a close one   I still love this car  The upcoming Subaru Baja would not be out for a while and still only had a mediocre engine  Actually  I hadn t even considered a Focus  Why  I wanted to get away from front wheel drive vehicles  I had a  front driver  at the time  my first  and was a little put off by the  quirkiness  of its  handling characteristics  I was about ready to just wait until something came along that suited me   and then something made me decide to give the Focus a try  I drove a  normal  2002 ZX3 and I loved it enough to consider buying it   but before I did I at least made the attempt to locate an SVT model  To make a long story short   I bought one  The handling is great  The looks are cool  subjective  The interior room and features are incredulous  You may find it hard to believe but it does handle better than the WRX  though not as fast  This is what front wheel drive should feel like  Only problem  mine came with a defect   the radiator had a hole or puncture  warranty item  There is no perfect car for everyone  rhetorical  but if I could be  greedy  then I d like to see 4 doors ZX 5  more power and all wheel drive  like the WRX This car is astounding for the price but many may not consider it because they may  group  it as a small car associated with the younger genre
