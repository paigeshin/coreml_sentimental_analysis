 My recent purchase of the 1999 Taurus SE has been nothing short of spectacular  This car has a smooth and roomy ride  It handles well in all weather conditions and responds easily to handling on the steering wheel  There is ample room in both the front and back to easily accommodate a family of four  In addition  the child safety locks are an excellent feature to have on this vehicle  I particularly liked that there is a built in security system that comes standard on the Taurus  The only drawback I have found is with the cruise control  The car operates nicely when the cruise is on  However when disengaging the cruise control it appears as if the car is still speeding up instead of slowing down  This feeling of a  quot delayed reaction quot  made me feel somewhat uneasy  My mechanic showed me documentation that other motorists have had similar comments regarding this feature  Overall  I do feel this is an excellent car particularly for families  The trunk is spacious in carrying luggage for vacations and the kids certainly won t feel cramped in the back seat as the will have plenty of room for riding
