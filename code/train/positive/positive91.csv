 Dear Prosepctive Car Buyer We just got our Ford Expedition 1 year ago and we just love it  At first we had the next best thing  a Ford Explorer  and that was the tops  Now  we have the Ford Expedition and we just live in it  We have a Huge Triton V8 5 4 litre  This is just a monster  We can pull boats  trailers  mobile homes  You name it and the Ford Expedition can take it on  With just the right amount of space inside  this Ford Expedition does not even compare to the GMC Sonoma or the GMC Suburban   Other cars we had considered when purchasing the Expedition  Ford has such an excellent reputation and it sure lives up with this  Only in the shop for an oil change  it really lives up to standard From torque  to comfort and from luxury to power  the Ford Expedition blows away all other competitors Thanks for reading my article write up
