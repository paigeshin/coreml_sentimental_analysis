 Talk about a nobrainer  Ford has some pretty good stuff out there and Ford has been around for a long time as a leader in car productions  I bought my Ranger a year ago and is been a great  fast  sporty  trustworthy truck  I have just the basic stock 4 cyl  standard  anti lock brakes  and A C  You dont need more than this to be pleased with the car  But if you want speed  go for the Ranger Splash  They have a 4 0 L V 6 and they haul  Over all Rangers are one of the best compact pickups for the dollar  The one and only down side is they re just what they re called  compact  If you re tall or need some extra space for cargo  get an extended cab for sure because there is no room in a single cab
