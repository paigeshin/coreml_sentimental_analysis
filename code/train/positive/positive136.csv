 My wife bought this car 4 years ago  Jan 97  and we use this car as our  around town  car  Other than tires  oil and brakes we have never had this car in the shop  This car has held up through long road trips  cramming with luggage and a couple of small fender benders We like this car because of its looks as well as its design The controls are all in easy reach of the driver and passenger  We have the 5 speed  which for a car in this price range  is surprisingly agile The car could use bigger tires and wheels to help it stick to the road  but the suspension is good and firm in most turns  We have the 4 cyl engine  which is not the most powerfull engine  if you like this car but want power  get the  GT The engine is a high revving engine that most people can have some fun with  All in all a good car for the money  Would be suitable for a teenager   the gas mileage is great  the car is reliable and it has dual air bags
