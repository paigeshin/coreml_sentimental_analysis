 Everyone who knows something about cars  and or anything about the Ford Windstar then they know it is a very praised van  5 star crash test rating  what could be more important  numerous awards  and more  This is arguably the most popular mini van on the market  for good reason I ve owned a Ford Winstar for about a year and a half now and have had no real problems to date  This is a very reliable car  not to mention its performance  This car still has that new car feel when you first test drive it  it is very smooth running  Another thing that is great about the Ford Windstar  is that IT IS A FORD  What car company has the experience that Ford does  With Ford you know that you are getting a good quality automobile that will last you for many years to come  For instance  my father just sold his 1988 Ford F 150  which was in perfect condition from the inside  the body was somewhat rusted  and it turned out to be a bargain from the price he paid for it to last him 12 years with very minimal visits to the shop Back to the Windstar itself  If you have a large family  or even a small one  you cannot go wrong with this car  Just by looking at you can tell it has  quot family car quot  written all over it  It s perfect to take the kids on long trips and the car is very versatile  All in all the Ford Windstar is a great car that you and your family will enjoy for a long while br br
