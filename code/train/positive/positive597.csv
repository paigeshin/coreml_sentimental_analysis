 Yes indeed  this  compact  SUV is a gentle ride with superb  responsive handling  Braking is smooth and crisp and the 16 inch wheels are very nice  The exterior looks are clean  sporty and have a touch of elegance  especially with the 2 tone grey lower body moulding  The Mach stereo is quite bold and the 6 CD changer is handy to have  saves me from fishing around in the center console for another disc  The 2 tone leather seating is elegant and upscale  the storage pods are plenty and the leg room for driver and passenger belies its size  The sun roof is easy to operate and an option with every penny when you can smell the sweet breeze Initially I wasn t wild about the color of my Escape  red  but it s really more of a rich ruby and I ve received a ton of compliments on the hue Mostly though I appreciate the safety factors such as the front and side air bags and the ABS braking capabilities On the down side  as I glance over my left shoulder in preparation for a lane change  the visual is not clear  and folding down the rear seats is more complicated than it should be  The gear shift lever is too long and sometimes gets in the way of the nicely placed instrument panel  The fabled  wind noise  problem is corrected for me by rolling up windows Folks  I m a long time GMC  Jimmy  owner and I was skeptical of a Ford product  Believe me  my initial resistance has been replaced by cheerleading for this frisky  sporty  sophisticated SUV  Additionally  almost all of the sites I visited through various search engines raved about the Escape  More importantly  owners of Escapes did too I can recommend the 2003 Ford Escape XLT Premium without qualification  You ll be so happy with this vehicle
