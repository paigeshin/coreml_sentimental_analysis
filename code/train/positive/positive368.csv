 My Expy came with a trailer towing package  full power inside and inclement weather package  The motor a 4 8 liter  is very weak on power when towing  If your thinking of buying an Expy and plan on towing anything  I strongly urge you to consider the bigger motor  You will find that while towing anything  slight upgrades in the road will cause your Expy with the little motor to kick out of overdrive and into high gear  If you live in a mountainous area  then be prepared NOT to use overdrive Overall  my Expy is a comfortable ride and we have had little problems with it  The longevity of all Ford motors is proven  but do consider an extended warranty as this vehicle has numerous sensors that can nickle and dime you  I did have a bad ride and alot of road noise with the Goodyear tires that came on the expy from the factory  I switched to Michelins and found the ride much better and the road noise gone  Consider the Michelin LTX M S series tire for your expy if you change tires I enjoy my Expy and found it to be a comfortable ride  easy to manuever  stable at high speeds and during changing lanes and a real joy to drive  Hope you have as good a luck with yours br br
