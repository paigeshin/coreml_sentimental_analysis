 I m considering starting an on line ford explorer club  do you think there is interest  I see many such clubs on the web for Mustangs  Camaros  Eclipses etc  There seems to be as many Explorers out there as anything so I think there could be a need for this  I will be contacting Ford to get their support and approval  My idea is to have a free membership where people can enroll and submit the latest news  information and developments regarding their vehicle  e mail me if your interested at kevincwgordon yahoo com   If I get a good response I will start work on the site over the holidays
