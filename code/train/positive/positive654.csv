 I recently purchased a 1999 Ford Escort  The company handled my questions quickly and efficiently My car was and is a great buy  It gets great mileage and a full tank usually costs around  11 00 with gas prices being  1 21  The Escort is a nice economy sized car and is excellent for the whole family  The back seat can be pulled down for more room for larger things  The trunk is midsize and can fit almost anything  The crash rating is high  I had a little fender bender and Ford fixed it quickly in a week or less  The sound system makes you feel like you are there at a concert  Even better is that some Escorts have a 6 cd changer in them Problems with the Escort is the bumpy ride  I am used to bigger cars  this is quite a change  More noise retention is needed with this car  This car is small and along with it come small shocks  The tire rims always need cleaning  I can clean them and go driving for an hour just to come back and have them dirty again  The windshield wipers wash the rain off but some of it stays on the side of the window  The wind pushes you around also and can be scary at times This is a great car  I bought it because I like small cars and I feel safe in it  The drive  once you get used to it  is nice br br
