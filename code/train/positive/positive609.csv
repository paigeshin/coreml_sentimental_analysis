 Why did I buy this vehicle  My previous car was having problems  I needed a reliable car because I commuted to a college 27 miles away  I went shopping for used cars  but the dealership in my hometown  in Northern California  offered 0 9  financing on all 1998 Ford Escorts to buyers with good credit  I test drove the car  liked it  and decided to buy it  With the 0 9  financing  I got a brand new car for the same price that I could have bought a 7 or 8 thousand dollar used car  A new car was perfect for me because I needed something reliable  I love driving a car that gets 35 miles to the gallon  seats for comfortably  and can keep up with the two seaters  Having the efficiency of an economy car  the room of a family car  and a car that can climb the Siskiyou mountains  very steep  in fifth gear leaves me completely pleased with this car  It may sound corny but I can honestly say that I do not have one complaint about this car  considering the low price I paid for it  approximately  12800 and only 0 9  interest  When you test drive this vehicle  it will probably feel less swift than it actually is  This is because it is designed to be a commuter car  and it is unusually high geared  It is designed for the highway  not the speedway   You can feel the difference when driving a Contour  Who should buy this car    college students  reliability    commuters  great freeway car    families on a limited budget  has all the basic necessities of a quality car  at a price us poor folk can afford  Who shouldn t buy this car    hot rodders  like I said before  this car is for the highway not the speedway br br
