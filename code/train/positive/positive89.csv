 After owning 3 Ford Explorers we decided to order a new 98 Expedition in the Fall of 97  We ordered a 4x2 w  leather  6pack CD  4 6L engine and without rear seat or towing pkg  We also purchased the extended 6 yr  100 000 mile warranty  We have traveled extensively in this car since then  Putting over 50 000 miles on it  Total repairs have been to replace the front brakes at 36 000 and the rears at 50 000 miles  Other than that we have changed the engine oil every 4 000 miles and the transmission at 36 000 miles  The original tires are still doing well  having rotated them every other oil change  They look like they have at least another 15 000 safe miles  NO other problems  Fuel mileage on trips averages 21  MPG  around town about 15 or so  I m satisfied in every way with this car and would recommend one to just about anyone that wants this type of automobile  The only down side is that it won t fit in all parking garages  We have found a couple where the roof rack will hit  I have found it an easy matter to remove the roof rack if I am going to be exposed to this situation  The car is a very smooth and stable vehicle on the road  It will cruise 80 miles per hour all day with no effort  When you get out of the comfortable leather bucket seats after a 10 hour run you are not totaled  as you are in some cars  We really enjoy it  Another plus is the visibility  my wife enjoys the safety afforded by this and the size of the unit  If you are in a wreck you will probably be safer than in a smaller car
