 I bought my sport in July of 2002 and have not had any problems with it  I am really happy with the way it handles  I used to have a 93 explorer sport and the 93 handled like a dump truck compared to my 02   The steering is tight and there is minimal body lean  The power is very good  My 93 had pretty good power of the line but was a dog on the highway  My 02 is another story  My 02 has 204 hp versus 160 hp and you can really feel the difference on the highway and the off the line power is real good too  The seats are real firm but comfortable  My sport has the pioneer 290 watt 6 Disc changer with Subwoofer  Man this stereo sounds great  The interior looks great too with high quality  Mine has the overhead console too with compass and outside temperature with i find pretty useful although i did not think i would initially  The exterior styling is totally awesome   the best looking Suv out there  I get between 16 and 20 miles per gallon which i think is acceptable for a Suv  So i can say that i am really happy with my 02 sport
