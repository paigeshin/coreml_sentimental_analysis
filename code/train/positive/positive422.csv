 The new Ford Mustang GT convertible is a very good car overall  It has great looks  great handling and an aggressive powerful feel  I personally give the car a 8 out of a 10  There are a few things I don t like though  they are   There is a lot of road noise and wind noise with the convertible  although the Horse power has been increased I still feel that the 5 0 motor is a better motor  Auto transmission in the 1999 2000 feels kind of sluggish  it feels like it takes too long for it to accept the power from the engine to drive the wheels  I kick myself for getting an automatic every day  if your going to get one go with the 5 speed it feels much more powerful  Also the back seat is mostly useless to any adult  Only kids or small adults can be comfortable in the back  Don t get me wrong I love the car and if I had to do it again I would buy the car again but this time i would get the 5 speed br br
