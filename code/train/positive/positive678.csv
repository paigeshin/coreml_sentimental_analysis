 I am currently driving a Ford Focus  My van is in the shop and I got this car as a rental  I was exited to get it as I was just checking them out on the lot at the dealership  My husband in the next year or two will be needing a new car and this in in our price range The first thing I noticed after getting in the car was the roominess My husband is 6 quot  tall and has no problem fitting in it  It feels like you are not in fact in a compact car  But after driving it for the last few days I have been noticing little things that I don t like about it  One is the fact that there is no arm rest between the front seats  For me it was uncomfortable to have no place to put my arm  Also I had a hard time adjusting the seat back  The handle for it is in an awkward position and I had to open the door to gain access to it  Also I understand that the Focus is a compact but it seems to work really hard to get to highway speeds  This might be due to engine size but I don t know what size it has One last thing I did not like is the shifter  The car I have is an automatic and you can easily knock the shifter into another gear without pushing in the button A plus of the Focus is that it comes with tether anchors for car seats  Three of them  I don t know that three car seats could actually fit back there but two definitely could  The car sits a little higher up than other compacts that I have been in  You don t feel like someone could drive right over you  All in all I thought it was a good basic car  Great for a first car or a second family car  It seems to get great gas mileage  I myself prefer my van but hey  if someone gave me this car I wouldn t turn it down
