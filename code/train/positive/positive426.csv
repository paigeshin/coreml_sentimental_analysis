 I have an electric green 1999 ford mustang and I love it  It is my first car and it is a great first car  At first  not being comfortable with driving got me worried about having a sports car  but it handles great and rides as smooth as anything  I love everything about it especially the color  because it is different  It handles great  gets great gas milage  easy to drive  I would reccomend it to anyone that wants a reliable  fun and easy driving vehicle  The only fault that I can say about this car is that it is not a family car  it is good for one or two people  but if you have kids  it is probabaly not the best choice  but besides that I love it  and it is very comfortable in the front br br
