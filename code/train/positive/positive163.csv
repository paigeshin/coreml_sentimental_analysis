 We were expecting our fourth child and knew that riding in two cars was just not economical or expectable  I always have wanted a mini van and to be honest never considered a Ford till shopping around  YES the sales people did make a difference  but what really did it for us was that we could get WHAT we wanted  for the price we wanted without upgrading it and getting every little add on  We chose the one we did because of the room  the simplicity  little computer components  which to us means lower repair bills  What really surprised us is the mileage  We have driven it to Florida twice now and it beat our Honda Accord hands down and was so much more comfortable  The turning ratio is not as good as some we drove  but the roominess and the comfort is fantastic and a better trade  I am overweight and everything fits me  which is another bonus We will always by one  just keep trading it up for a new one  I test drove them all and will never turn from the Windstar again br br
