 We recently traded in our 1996 Dodge Caravan for a 2000 Ford Windstar  We had had the Caravan for three years  and I was very happy with it  so when it came time to make the change  I was a little leary  However  I found that the Windstar had almost all the features that I had had in the Caravan  When I found out that the Windstar had a five star safety rating  I was convinced  The first time I drove our new Windstar  I was amazed at the amount of power it had  Our Caravan had always been rather sluggish when pulling out of our driveway and onto our uphill street  But the Windstar took right off  I ve been guilty of giving it too much gas many times  because I expect it to need the extra push  It doesn t  One of the most important features to me  especially with getting three kids in and out  is the sliding door on the driver side  I was so glad to hear that the new Windstars had this  It makes it so much easier getting small children and packages in and out  without having to climb all the way inside  Plus  I feel much safer  knowing that if we were in an accident  there would be better accessibility to my children  The Windstar is also a much heavier vehicle  It does not get swayed by the wind nearly as much as the Caravan  I feel that it would hold up in a collision much better than the Caravan  I feel much safer driving the Windstar  knowing that it has a good safety rating  I have three children of my own  and always have my friends  children in the car as well  so safety is extremely important to me  The only thing missing from our new Windstar is the built in child restraints in the middle seat  I don t use them for my own children  but it is handy to have when extra kids are in the car unexpectedly  These are available in the Windstar  but we did not want to add the cost of having them installed  Our new Windstar is a beautiful vehicle  It is practical and safe  I would recommend it to anyone br br
