 I m publishing this review for those of you who are considering a purchase of any V6 model Ford Contour  I bought a 1999 Ford Contour SVT  Special Vehicle Team  because I like high performance European type vehicles without the high costs usually associated with any Euro model car that fits this description My initial test drive of the 1999 Ford Contour SVT made me smile  which isn t all that easy to do when it comes to cars  I demand a vehicle that can REALLY perform and handle well in the twisties and at the same token  deliver good looks and carry four people with relative ease  I purchased my 1999 Ford Contour SVT new in December of 1998  it is now November of 2000 and I currently have 42k miles on the odo In retrospect  I can give an honest and well experienced review of the pro s and con s of this 4 door performance sedan  If you are on a budget and want a 4 door performance sedan  this is definitely a car to consider  Performance is right up there with most BMW s at a considerably cheaper price  What are the pro s By far the biggest pro is the performance the SVT model offers  but even the non SVT models are good performers for those who don t want to pay the premium attached with the limited production runs that come with all SVT cars  Car and Driver hustled the SVT from a standstill to 60MPH in just under seven seconds  6 9  and through the quarter mile in 15 4 seconds at 91MPH  For those of you unfamiliar with performance statistics  lets just say this 4 door performance sedan will keep right up with almost all V6 sport coupes on the market priced under  30k  and beat quite a few of them in the process  Handling is even better  generating 0 90G s on the skidpad  which means you ll most likely exceed your own personal tolerances well before you approach the car s handling limits  The SVT s front bucket  leather is standard in the SVT models  seats are VERY comfortable and VERY supportive during spirited driving maneuvers  Overall steering feel is excellent  with only mild understeer once the handling limits are reached or slightly exceeded  and the power assist works wonderfully at any speed  As far as the ergonomics go  the trunk is spacious for a car this size  and the controls and gauges are all laid out clearly and easy to use  So what are the con s Mostly fit and finish in the interior areas  I ve also noticed some suspension noises  clunks and rattles  especially during the colder seasons of the year  Interior noise isn t up to par with most cars  even in its own price range  Cup holders are horrible up front  and non existent in the rear  there are inserts that Ford sells that solve the problem up front though  Interior lighting leaves much to be desired  There is no glovebox light  a REAL inconvenience at night to say the least  and no rear passenger lighting exists either  Rear brake noise has been an issue for me personally from time to time as well  Dependent upon whether or not you like it  you may or may not appreciate the exhaust engine noise  Keep in mind this car  and especially the SVT model  is designed with the performance enthusiast in mind  so the exhaust and engine are tuned accordingly  I personally love the growl from under the hood and from the exhaust Overall  I think the V6 1999 Ford Contour s are great contender s in the market segment for which they compete  Unfortunately for me but fortunate for others  the resale value is about average for a Ford vehicle  which means you can get a REALLY good price on slightly  read 1 2 years old  used models that have been well cared for  and even better deals on slightly older models br br
