 My 36 month lease is set to run out on my 2000 Ford Taurus wagon  I have really enjoyed the large cargo area provided with the rear seats folded down  My experience is that the drivers seat was very comfortable although the seat backs could use more side bolstering  This car was definitely not a sporty handler  but the ride was stable at speeds into the 90 s and was very comfortable under most conditions My car came equpped with leather seats  side airbags  and adjustable foot pedals which made it easy for the driver to find a comfortable position  The stopping distances recorded by independent testers were longer than average for this mid level bracket  Another complaint is that while this is not a noisy car  neither is it as quiet as others in its  class  Since I take some extremely long road trips  noise is something I really notice  If Ford could reduce the engine noise  road and tire noise  and wind noise each a little bit it would greatly improve the driving experience  I felt that Taurus wagon had good materials and features for the price
