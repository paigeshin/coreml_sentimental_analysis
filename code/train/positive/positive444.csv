 Maybe if my purchase of the 1996 Ford Windstar LX passenger van had been as a new vehicle  instead of as a used vehicle with 35 000 hard miles on it  I would have enjoyed it more  Or maybe if I had never gone from driving passenger vans to SUVs before purchasing the Windstar I would have like it more  Or maybe   oh  who knows The bottom line is I really don t like this van  It had 35 000 miles on it when I traded in my beloved Honda Passport for it  I didn t want to give up my Passport  which might also have contributed to my dislike of the Windstar  but the Passport had a standard transmission and the clutch  combined with stop and go driving  became painfully incompatible with my very sick left knee  Financial circumstances  my knee  and the shortage of gently used SUVs available in the Spring of 1999 led me to purchase the 1996 Windstar b Selling Features  I ve already mentioned that finances were a concern when I purchased the Windstar  Priced about  2 000 below any reasonably used and available SUVs at the time  the Windstar seemed like a bargain  I test drove the Windstar  a Mercury Villager  and a Chrysler Town And Country before deciding on the Windstar  Comfort  price and interior space were the major deciding factors as were the reliability ratings for the Windstar when compared with the other passenger vans A passenger car was not an option for me   after years of driving passenger vans and SUVs  I feel small and target like in a car b My 1996 Windstar  With a 6 cylinder  200 Horsepower engine  the Windstar is powerful enough for rapid acceleration  That s a necessity around here  and for me in general  as a light foot is something I ve never been accused of having behind the wheel Comfort is great for middle and back seat passengers  with adequate legroom for adults  Front seats are less comfortable  with driver s seat adjustments being minimal  but not completely unacceptable  A four hour drive to the beach is manageable  but a longer trip would require frequent stops Reliability is less than expected based on the reports I had read  but not outrageous  I ve had numerous electrical problems with my Windstar  including a phantom door locking problem and flaky  quot door open quot  indicators  Fortunately  all problems have been minor and were not safety issues Handling is typical for a passenger van  with a slightly sluggish feel  Driving on curvy mountain roads  sort of my  quot acid test quot  for handling and responsiveness  is not enjoyable in the Windstar The driver s seat belt has an unfortunate habit of jamming  although no passengers have ever noted a similar problem with the other seat belts  The captains seats in the center have been a blessing  preventing major sibling battles  although the mid van controls for the heat  air  and radio  which are available on one side only  have caused more than their share of conflict All driver controls are easily accessible and gauges and displays are well placed  The heater is powerful enough  which I ve not always found to be the case in passenger vans  and the air conditioner does an amazingly good job of cooling the entire vehicle quickly  Drink holders are smaller than is often necessary  they won t hold a large take out drink  but there are plenty of them Gas consumption  averaging around 24 miles per gallon  is better than I expected  although it does drop significantly when primarily city driving is done b The Final Analysis  Now that I ve detailed the features of my 1996 Windstar and my assessment of them  I realize I don t dislike the van nearly as much as I thought I did  Well  I still don t like it  but now I see that it s more a factor of my personal preference than the quality of the Windstar I guess that makes me feel better  But I suppose now I ll have to stop referring to it as  quot that tank of a van I m driving quot  Maybe my kids are right about this one  maybe I just need to  quot get over it quot br br
