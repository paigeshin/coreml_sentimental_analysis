 When picking out my first car  I had a lot of factors I considered  First  I wanted a car that was fun to drive and attractive  I also needed a reliable that was under  15 000  At first  I didn t realize that I could afford a 2001 Mustang  I found a great deal  and purchased my red Mustang  It was once a rental car  and it has 15 800 miles  There are three types of Mustangs  The 194 horsepower V6  the GT V8  and the high performance Cobra  I purchased the V6 with the Deluxe package   ABS  traction control  power seat  spoiler  CD I ve owned the car for about 7 months  and I haven t encountered a problem yet  The car is very fun to drive  When driving around town  the car quickly accelerates and passing is very easy  However  all this power means below average fuel economy  I ve been averaging 18 miles per gallon  The steering communicates lots of road feel  and the car handles well  The car has the firm ride of a sports car  and is relatively quiet  The brakes are exceptional Inside  the Mustang is well finished  The cabin has a high quality feel for the price  All the controls are within reach and very well designed  and the cup holders are of the best in any car I ve seen  The sound system provides great quality  even with the base system  One weakness with the car is the lack of rear seat room  and the small trunk  However  most people in the sports car market don t have a spacious rear seat on the top of their priority list Overall  the Mustang is an excellent car  A sports car should be fast  attractive  and fun  The Mustang has all these qualities and then some  which is why it has been one of America s most popular sports cars for almost 40 years
