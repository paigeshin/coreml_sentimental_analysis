 With  1 daughter preparing to get her license and inherit mom s  91 Passat  I went shopping for a replacement  The short list got very short  however  when I decided to consider only cars with timing chains rather than belts  Demanding a chain limits your choices to most GM products  including the Saturn 4 cyl s  and the Ford Duratec V6 family  The Contour was the perfect size   it ll fit 2 adults in back quite comfortably  although 3 will be tight  and it has a large  useful trunk  This year it comes in only 2 flavors  the loaded SE Sport with the quick 2 5 V6  or the very loaded SVT with the VERY quick 2 5 HO V6  And  given that it was mainly designed by Ford of Europe  where it is sold as the Mondeo  its character  amp  demeanor are markedly European  making it the natural successor to our old VW   Volkswagon has taken its prices so far upmarket that they didn t even rate consideration  The seats are more sculpted and orthopedically shaped than anything else Ford  or any other domestic  offers  very similar to those found in Volvos  The thick  leather wrapped wheel fills your hands  While the interior isn t plush  with all vinyl door panels and no chrome or wood trim  the car has some nice thoughtful touches such as a fold down armrest for the driver s bucket and door rocker switches for locks  amp  windows that illuminate at night  The car we bought had the automatic transmission and premium stereo with in dash CD  I passed on ABS  amp  traction control  sticker price was  18500  The local dealer that participated in CarPoint responded with an offer for  17300  or about 3  over cost  I feel this is an excellent price for a car with this level of equipment  and the deal was made all that much sweeter with a  1500 rebate from Ford  This car is a joy to drive  The engine feels eager to run  and the revs come up with turbine like smoothness  Shifting is crisp without feeling harsh  and the computer has adaptive capability so that the car soon acts as if it could anticipate exactly when you want it to shift  The car steers precisely and responsively  It s nicely balanced and very easy to drive quickly  It feels very much like the Cougar which is based on this car  but has the stealthy innocent look of a 4 door sedan  The Contour and its Mercury sister the Mystique qualify as Ford s best kept secrets  The cars receive virtually no advertising  and are destined to be dropped after this model year  This knowledge has induced many enthusiast owners of older models to trade in now for the latest model  It s a pity to see this car go away because it has sporting yet sophisticated qualities that don t come through in its replacement  the Focus
