 When we purchased our 1991 Ford Thunderbird Sport with a V8 and automatic almost 5 years ago I really had to do some convincing to get my husband to buy a Ford  He has always been a Chevy man  I must say  it has turned out to be a really good decision on our part  We wanted something big enough to accommodate 3 children in the back seat because we weren t ready for becoming a minivan family  and this car is perfect to seat 2 car seats and another child comfortably in the back My Thunderbird has 106 000 miles on it and we have only experienced two minor problems  One is the transmission gave out a few years ago and my husband contacted a transmission guy he knows who told him how to fix it with practically a twist of a wrench  Of course my husband is a mechanic  so maybe he just made it look easy  It still slips on really cold mornings but it s something I have learned to live with and expect  As soon as the car warms up  the transmission stops slipping The second thing that we have experienced is a headlight problem  We will be driving down the road at night and suddenly the headlights will go out  My husband has replaced the headlight switch and it didn t remedy the problem  A friend of his who owns a Ford says that he also has this problem with his headlights so maybe it is a known problem that can be easily fixed  I don t drive a whole lot after dark so this isn t a real major problem for me but it is quite bothersome when I do have to drive at night Those are the only two problems we have ever had out of our Thunderbird and it is 9 years old at this point so I am very impressed with it  And we aren t easy on the old gal either  It has primer on the door panel where I had a slight mishap  and she gets way over due on her oil changes but she just keeps on trucking along for us  I have been really happy with the ride  comfort  and the reliability and I would recommend the 1991 Thunderbird to any of my friends br br
