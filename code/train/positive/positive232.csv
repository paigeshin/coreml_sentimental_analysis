 I bought my Ford Aspire in 1994 brand new off the lot  I paid  9000 out the door  I had cruise control and a stereo added and later replaced it with a CD player  At first I didn t like the car  the interior was plain  the engine had no get up and go  and I had to put up with the wise cracks about how I was driving a washing machine on wheels  But now 6 years later I still have the car  my husband drives it now  and with 125 000 miles on it the car is still going strong  500 miles a week commute  I have put 2 brake jobs on the car  changed the tires all around 3 times  changed the battery once  had one tune up  and recently replaced a rotor in the engine all in the 6 years I ve owned the car  Not to mentioned the car has slid into two ditches and hit a curb hard which inturn it needed two front end alignments and a new rim  This is all the repair I have put into the vehicle and it is still going strong  I predict this car could go 180 000  with proper maintenance and I only paid  9000 dollars for it  What a deal  As I now see it anyone who wants an affordable  reliable  and fun car should get this one  But if you are looking for performance and style steer clear  this is not the car for you FYI  the Ford Aspire is actually a Kia Avella  The car model was purchased and marketed in the states by Ford before Kia made its move in the American market  The car was 80  Kia and 20  Ford  If you are looking for a car similar to the Ford Aspire in todays market check out the Kia Sephia the body style and features are different but under the hood is pretty much the same
