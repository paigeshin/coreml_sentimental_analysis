 Well lets see  The Ford Mustang  It goes way back in history as a muscle car of the 60 s and 70 s but still goes on today  I have never had the thrill of owning a Ford Mustang and probably never will  But my feelings will never change Back in the early 60 s there were many types of mustangs  coupe  convertable  fastback  GT  Boss  Ex  Now in the 90 s and in Y2K  There isnt as many versions of the mustang  You have the Cobra  Coupe  Conv  and Boss  You have to special order the real sportsters  They only market on the showroom floor the Convertable and Coupe  Why not let us see them all for a change  The major thing I like about the new mustang the 99 model and 2000 is that they have increased the horsepower up to 30hp  dont sound like much but you get into a v6 and it feels like you are in a Gt  No lie  I once testdrove a Gt and a v6  The power of a v6 was unreal and I really got excited as they put the extra umph  I really like the older style  but with the way the world goes everything must change  some for the better and some for the worst  I would surely buy a mustang if I was able to and really needed a sport car  but for the hot rod at heart its the sure choice br br
