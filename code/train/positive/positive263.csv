 Purchased from City of Seattle in an auction for  2000  I ve been the owner of my 1991 periwinkle blue Ford Escort LX for a little over a year now  Receiving this car when I had first received my drivers license  this car and I have been together through a lot Mainly driving the car to school and work  the interior is quite nice and comfortable for myself  although I wish the seats had more adjustment options because they can get to be quite stiff at times and aren t very back friendly for anything more than a daytrip  There isn t a lot of room in this car either  so I wouldn t reccomend it to a family of four or more  however  it s just fine for a short ride Driving this car has always been enjoyed  especially on day trips up to the ski resort  In the city this is the perfect car becuase it runs smooth and is easy to drive  Freeway driving on this car  however  isn t very fun  The car starts to get a little shaky anywhere after 60mph  although 60 is where the car is happiest to sit  and is  very  slow to accelerate  I must give it credit though for maintaining speed smoothly  The only problem I ve ever had with this car is the alternator  and don t go to a ford dealer to have this one fixed  and the pesky little  check coolant  light that mysteriously flashes on for a while randomly  and randomly shuts off  when the coolant is just fine  Gotta love Ford If the car does break down  however  be glad it s light  Because this car is really easy to push out of intersections  and very easy to tow with a tractor if need be  I know this from personal experience  and I was pretty glad  My favorite thing about this car is the spacious interior  not for hauling people  but things  The hatchback with the removable cover  and easy fold down backseat make it very easy to stick a lot in there  The feature of being able to fold down one seat alone or the entire back bench has been very nice in many situations as well  I drive up to Mt  Baker  Washington  quite often to snowboard  this car is  perfect  for an intensive hour long drive around fast corners  with three friends for passengers  and one seat folded down for the snowboards  The only shame is sometimes going around the corners you slide a bit when it s not expected  the car s ride can trick you sometimes into thinking the car can do things it really can t Cheap cars when it comes to purchasing  parts  and gas  They ride really well and are fun little cars to have  My car may be no Audi  but it s mine and I love it  The only thing I ve done to my car was buy it a new stereo  because ford factory radios aren t worth a thing  So if you would like a cheap car that will last you forever  is pretty dependable  and nice for commuting  this is a decent car for you
