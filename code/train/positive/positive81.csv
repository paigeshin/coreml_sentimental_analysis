 All I have to say is if your looking for a Truck the F150 would be a good choice  The F150 that I am telling you about is a 2000 F 150 4x4 Supercab Lariat 139 quot  WB flareside with a 5 4 EFI V8 engine  When I was out comparing trucks I was looking for one that had the power to pass at any given time and the comfort of a car  I compared price and that seemed about the same  The selling points for me was the look  the drive  and the power  This truck rides smooth and doesn t do bad on gas as well  As for the power  it was unmatched  Their are many different styles to choose from as well  Some other selling points would be the compartment between the seats has plenty of room for anything you might want to put in there  Although this truck is sleek  it probably would be a little difficult for some people to get in and out of it
