 The 1999 Ford F 350 has an awesome look to match it s awesome abilities  The model we purchased has four doors  the long 8ft bed  4WD and is toped off with the Triton V 10 engine with enough horsepower to satisfy any truck fan  Big and roomy  Ford made this truck to complete many tasks that will fit everyone  From hauling 8ft sheets of plywood  moving a friend  taking huge loads of branches to the local dump  taking a long family trip  or even for a mountain hunting trip  this truck is truly built ford tough  Personal recommendations  Put on a camper shell if you want to use it for travel  You can fit 6 people very comfortable  so having the shell will enable you to put all of your travel needs  as well as shopping bags in an air shell for both room and protection  With a shell on the long bed  this truck will be bigger and badder that the suburbans  and even Fords new Excursion  Also  putting a supercharger will bulk up the already tremendous amount of horsepower so I wouldn t call it a necessity  Put on a 2 or 3 chamber Flowmaster muffler to get out that loud V 10 sound  and if you like custom vehicles  change the tires and rims to either get a Lower  sleeker look  or a higher  tougher look  Take it for a test drive and feel the power of Ford Triton engines br br
