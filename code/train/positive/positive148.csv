 I m semi retired and about to retire shortly so I wanted to find a vehicle that would serve my needs  I decided to buy my 2000 Ford Ranger XLT LWB after I looked at the competition  My desire was to get a truck to haul lumber home for special projects the LWB is 7  long  carry my big RC model airplanes to from the field  drive something that was economical to run  my 2 5 ltr 4 cyl w  automatic  amp  overdrive gets 24MPG  The seating room is better then my old 87 chevy C10 PU I sold a few years ago  I am overweight and felt that I might have to get one with a supercab but the regular cab fits me just fine  It rides just fine with a load of lumber but is a bit bouncy  as they all are  on poor roads  The only option I added was a tarp cover that fits over the bed and rests on 4 arched aluminum rails to allow rain to run off My truck also is helpful on trips from the nursery with loads of mulch  lots of plants or moving a few appliances for neighbors This is Not a truck to pull a big boat or trailer nor does it have the HP or torque to carry big loads like a full size truck but it works just fine  Like any pickup caution must be used when driving in snow ice  I looked at trucks from all the manufacturers and had 2 basic needs  good milage and something I would enjoy driving  I found both in this truck and recommend it to any one going on a fixed income and yet wants to have a certain amount of flexability in their vehicle br br
