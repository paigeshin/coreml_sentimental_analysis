 I bought my Ford Explorer in 1993 when they weren t the  quot station wagon quot  of the 90 s  I have a dirt road 1 3 mile long with lots of ruts and bumps  I haul pot bellied pigs and my dog  straw  heavy food bags and drive on the lawn  My Explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires  This vehicle is great for riding tough  I change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year  This vehicle is not made just for good looks  This vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car  haul  and off road br br
