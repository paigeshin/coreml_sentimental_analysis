 This review is about  Ford Mustang 3 8L Coupe  with stick shift I test drove when I considered buying it  I say  considered  because I did not buy it and here is why b Test Drive  The dealer talked too much during the test drive  They always try to do that to distract you  but I noticed the following things b Styling  You can argue  but I think it could be better  The car looks bulky  the C pillars are thick  which increases  blind spots    I was afraid to run over somebody while backing up  the standard wheels look crude  The previous Mustang looked more balanced b Engine  The 3 8L 193 hp engine does not seem all that powerful  even with stick  We went on the freeway onramp and I was disappointed  Strange  considering the 220  lb ft of torque rating at as low as 2800 rpm  European and Japanese manufacturers manage to extract more than 200 hp out of 3 0 liter engines Note  the A C was on during the test drive and was very efficient  It might eat some power  but not that much b Transmission  The shifter has quite short travel  which is good  but the clutch does not provide any feedback   you cannot feel it engage by the pedal pressure  or the dealer talked too much  The clutch also engaged very high in the pedal travel  I drove some Eastern European cars for several years and never had complaints like this one  Or maybe I m getting old and grumpy b Suspension  The suspension is not only stiff  but creates a lot of unnecessary up and down motions  The car uses live axle in the rear  so I didn t expect much anyway b Standard Equipment  The list of standard equipment looks good  It includes power windows  mirrors  locks and remote keyless entry  alloy  ugly  wheels  AM FM CD cassette player  A C  dual vanity mirrors  etc b Interior  Interior  materials  fit and finish  looks cheap  I did not expect walnut for  16K  but Ford could have done better  As I said  the C pillars are wide  in coupe  and the interior room is smaller than I d like  The steering wheel tilts but does not telescope  which might be a problem for the tall people b Insurance and Safety  Insurance rates are high  especially if you are a male younger than 25  The crash test results are not encouraging either   the overall rating is  Acceptable  with  Poor  death rate and  Marginal  injury rate b Fuel Economy  I didn t get a chance to see the actual fuel consumption myself  but on paper it s 19 MPG city   29 MPG highway  Not impressive for the car of this size with manual transmission b Warranty and Reliability  b Consumer Reports b  magazine says that Mustang has poor reliability  Ford provides 36 000 mile   3 year warranty and 5 year corrosion warranty  Majority of other manufacturers offers 60 000 mile   5 year powertrain warranty  100 000 mile   10 year warranty for Hyundai Kia The last three  safety  fuel economy and reliability  also depend on the way you drive b Pricing  The price was good  in theory  I know that you can get the car for less than  16K  at CarsDirect com  for example  but the particular dealership I went to wanted more than  17K and did not want to negotiate the price at all  Besides they were very pushy and rude  Needles to say  they did not earn my business  they didn t even try The dealer was constantly asking what monthly payment I can afford  Well  I can afford the payment I need to get better car  I walked  after which they called me several times asking how they can make me buy the car  today  I was unable to produce any kind of positive reply on this one I In car buying a lot depends on personal taste  If you like Mustang s styling and features and decide to buy it  it is a good deal  providing you with electric everything  remote keyless entry  radio CD cassette  V6 engine and alloy wheels for less than  16  If you want refinement  fit and finish  safety and reliability  get ready to pay more for something else I
