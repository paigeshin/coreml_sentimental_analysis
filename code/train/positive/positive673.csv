 I decided to put some fun in my commute   120 miles a day roundtrip  when I decided to buy a new car  Enter the Ford Focus ZX3 b MY FIRST NEW CAR   MAIN REASONS TO BUY  I bought it because it s great handling  decent fuel economy  price and over all fun ness to drive  I know  fun ness  is very subjective but trust me   take a ZX3 for a test drive you ll see  It was my first NEW car ever and I didn t want to throw my money away  I researched very carefully  I looked at the obvious in it s class ish Honda  reliable but dull  Toyota Echo  see my other review  way too many cons  VW  too much money for not enough car  and some others  I went to each dealer armed with TONS of information off the internet with stats and INVOICE pricing on each car  I knew exactly what each car cost the dealer at its INVOICE price  So  I knew what I could get for how much without paying too much over sticker  I wound up paying exactly the invoice price for my new silver ZX3 5 spd with AC and tilt wheel with navigator options b  THE DRIVE  To tell you the truth  the 5 spd is REALLY zippy  It won t beat a Corvette or anything on a jack rabbit stop light start  but it really cruises along best at highway speeds  I often look down at the speedometer to unknowingly be going 80  The ZX3 is very easy to negotiate through all kinds of traffic  with good stopping power  And the cornering is awesome for a little Ford  Take it on a test drive  hopefully without the sales person  JUST so you can take those corners FAST   you ll see Added bonus  PARKING  If you live in a city where parking is at a premium  you can squeeze into those tiny spots while the envious Monster SUV owners have no choice but to cruise on by  N  Side of Chicago especially b INTERIOR  The interior is great   easy to get to everything and doesn t look feel cheap for the inexpensive amount you paid   the leather wrapped steering wheel is a nice touch  The back seat is VERY roomy  Every time someone gets back there they always say something about how much room there is  AND most of these people drive full sized cars and are used to room b ADDED BONUS  Leather wrapped steering wheel Fog Lights CD Player Are ALL standard b  THE NOT SO GREAT   Now this is not to say the car hasn t had problems  It has  The brake pads and rotors were replaced at 4 000 miles  I am at 13 000 no probs since  and of course the re have been recalls  Mine was only affected by one recall  These are actually things I can deal with  but considering my service dept where I bought the car sucks  it makes it even more difficult to deal with these problems  I expected to have some probs  DID NOT expect the service to suck as much as it does  So  before you buy make sure you find out how good the  service  IS in the service department    Overall  Some problems are to be expected if you want to be the first kid on the block with the cool new toy such is the case with the 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 The really good news is  a lot of the bugs have since been worked out with the 2001s Just because you have to buy economy doesn t mean you have to feel like you re driving an econo box  see the Toyota Echo b Ford Focus ZX3   you get a lot of car  for not a lot of money    Note  Why revised  Because I wrote this before I knew at Epinions  I simply wrote it at first  to tell everyone in the market what a great car this was  I didn t even know what Epinions was  The revisions have cleared up some of the format to be more Epinion friendly  Thanks  revised June 2001 Update  32 000 miles in one year so far so good  Warrenty will be up soon  No problems with brakes since 13K  but still worried about them Still handles well  although gas milage seems to be dipping  I used to get about 32MPG  mostly highway  now I average about 27 MPG
