 Ok  it s not new anymore  The brake pedal looks worn and the new car smell is long gone  but I still love my Ford Escort Wagon  I bought my Ford wagon brand new in 1993  It s been afforded all the basic upkeep required  i e  regular oil changes  the ocassional trip to the car wash  etc  Now 105 000 miles later  I still can t bring myself to part with it  Even today it is my main source of transportation Oh  I haven t babied it any  This tough little tiger has seen seven unfriendly Montana winters and faithfully carried me over small  back country  wooded  one lane  gravel roads  It almost single handedly served as a moving van for my family several times and has served to push another of our lesser vehicles to a safe parking place when the other vehicle failed me  I am absolutely amazed at how My Ford Escort Wagon performs for me My fuel economy is favorable and manuerablity is faithful  I m not ready to go shopping for a new vehicle just yet  but one day when my little station wagon has reached the limits of it s usefulness  there is no question that I ll be back on the Ford lot  looking to bring home the next generation br br
