 Well  this is not the type of review that I generally write  I am a mom to 4 girls and am busy doing things related to raising them  I don t know much about the technical workings of cars  but I drive them A LOT  I really felt compelled to write an epinion about this car We recently traded in our Ford Contour and purchased the much bigger Crown Victoria  Try getting a family of six in a Contour  No can do  So out we went to buy a larger sedan for my hubby to drive  He is no car expert either so we had to drive and redrive and sit in every car that seated 5 6 passengers comfortably  We did this 23 302 times while we were deciding what was the best car for us The Crown Vic was our choice hands down  It is plenty roomy in the backseat  My teenagers and kindergartener have plenty of leg room and space for all the stuff they must carry no matter where they go  The front bench seat will sit 3  but the middle person is a bit cramped  The airbags make it unsafe to put a child there  but that is really the size of the space  However  we can put an adult there for short trips and it works okay The drive is really smooth and the car handles like a much smaller car  There is ample power on acceleration and people get out of your way because they think you are a cop  I especially like the way this car brakes  I don t know any technical terms  but it is very responsive The Crown Vic gets pretty good gas mileage  about 25 mpg on average  The tank holds about 20 gallons of gasoline  The gas cap is easy to get on and off The trunk is huge and has a safety release strap in the event that you should somehow become trapped in there  Great for those with adventurous youngsters  The only drawback of this car is that it is rear wheel drive  We feel that this issue was effectively dealt with the addition of traction control  which my husband swears by  We are thrilled by our purchase and it is a dream to drive this car  We got a great deal on the car and Ford gave us extra incentive 0  financing for 60 months  Can t beat it  I hope this review helps those that are not car experts  but want to find a really terrific car  The Crown Vic will not disappoint
