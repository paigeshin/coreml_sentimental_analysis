 I was looking for my first truck in 1997 and after looking at all the makes  I settled on the Ford Ranger  I chose the Ranger because of the Consumer Reports Rec and the price  Went to a dealer  in Feb 1997  that had leftover 1996 models  First I test drove the regular cab but I just didn t fit as I m 6 2  and my knees were jammed into the steering wheel  Then I tried the extended cab model and found it roomy  I bought the Ranger Extended Cab XLT 2WD  5 speed manual  with AC  cruise  power windows  remote entry  I have loved this truck since I m still driving this truck today with 105 000 miles on it  Last week I just got a tune up for the first time for  240  I only had this truck repaired twice  once for a noisy wheel bearing for  90 and another time to weld a loose tail pipe for  40  That s it I find this truck very comfortable with the 60 40 split bench seat and the spacious cab  Another feature I like is the 19 9 gallon fuel tank  I average 22mpg for mixed city highway driving so I can get at least 400 miles between fuelings  This is handy on long trips There is one minor problem that I m living with  The dome light stays on intermittently  When I park and lock the door  the light stays on so I pulled the bulbs out of the sockets so I don t drain my battery The ride is decent  but a little noisy  not too serious though  Handling is decent  The 4 cyl has enough power to do the job but sometimes I wish I had some extra power to pass slower cars and for steep hills  It has 105 000 miles on it but I m not finished with it yet  I plan to keep it for another year at least 130 000 mile update  This truck is still going strong  No problems and made it through the winter without a hitch
