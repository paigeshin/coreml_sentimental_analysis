 Purchased a new 1997 E 150 conversion van  One of the best vehicles we ve ever owned  The captains  chairs are very comfortable and can be adjusted to just about any position one could want  The rear bench folds down into a bed that s both comfortable and easy to operate  We had a Rear A C installed   not a separate compressor but a separate coil and blower  Works extremely well   best  75 we ve ever spent  Opted for the 6 cylinder   like the mileage we get  up to 22 hwy miles  and it holds highway cruising speed quite well  On other than level roads though  the transmission shifts frequently when the cruise control is on and the speed is over 65  But on level roads  it works just fine  The separate reading lights allow the kids to read or play games at night without distracting the driver  The noise level is very low  We had the cold weather package added  even though we bought it in El Paso  TX  The extra insulation sprayed on the bottom insulates the sound too  Have never used the plug in block heater  The van now has about 50 000 miles on it  The only repairs have been a new starter  160  and a front brake job  400  Both were done by a Ford dealer so I m sure better prices could be had elsewhere  Oh  and we just replaced the tires  Not bad for a vehicle that s driven across the US three times and made innumerable  quot road trips quot  with a family of 5  all the boys have their own seat  no one touches anyone else  The van is extremely roomy and cost less than any of the minivans we looked at  All in all  a superior value for the money br br
