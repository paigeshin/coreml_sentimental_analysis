 I have a 1991 Ford Escort LX  I m 16 years old and this is my first car  I totally recommend this vehicle  Throughout the time I have had it  I haven t had any major problems  which is suprising considering the age of this car  It s reliable and gets good gas mileage  This is the perfect car for a teenager  For parents  it is a relief to know your child is protected and won t be broken down on the side of the road every other week  It s an automatic and easy to drive and handle  The only problem I have noticed is when the car reaches 65 miles per hour on the interstate  It becomes a little jumpy and the steering loosens slightly  But  my dad is basically a car expert and he believes this is nothing to worry about Buy this car   you will be happy you did br br
