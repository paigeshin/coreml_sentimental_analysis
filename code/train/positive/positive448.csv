 My husband of almost 2 years and I own a 1996 Ford Windstar  Between us  we have 5 kids so a mini van became a must when we got married  I had previously owned a Plymouth Voyager but when I met my husband  I had a small car  We bought the Windstar out of necessity but I have to admit that I love the comfortable ride  the opening hatch that conveniently holds groceries or  quot surprises quot  that I don t want the kids to see right away or whatever else I chose to store back there  My family fills that van when we all go somewhere together yet still  everyone sits comfortably  If there were one thing I would like to have had on this van  it would be the now popular extra sliding door  That would come in handy  especially  when I want to get kids in and out and would like to not fan the baby  Another drawback to this particular van is that we have had continuous problems with the check engine light coming on and for some reason  the drivers side window is now refusing to come down  We ve had it in the shop many times and they reset the computer and all is well until the next go around  Now  the warranty is out so we don t rush it in anymore  The check engine light is out but the window is still giving us trouble  This is extremely annoying but as far as comfort and the way it drives  I still love it br br
