 My  93 Ford Mustang finally gave up the ghost at the most inopportune time  right before my Spring Break trip to Paris  Not about to lose the second trip of a lifetime  see my review of Belfast for the first  I scoped the Eiffel Tower before coming back and dealing with reality  Fortunately  my Ford dealer pulled a mess of strings  and  ta da  I was driving home from Houston  another long story  in my new 2000 Ford Ranger Of course  you ll run your usual gamut of Ford  anagram for Fix or Repair Daily  putdowns  but the Mustang  yep  even the recently deceased  has always been an old reliable for me  and there was just something about the Ranger that made me want to go for it  I wouldn t open a hauling company with one  but other than that  this baby will tote whatever you like down the highway without the excessive fishtailing you see in similar economy pickups  It s got about six feet of bedroom that will allow you to flag any oversized loads comfortably without expecting a pork wagon to pull you over  As I said  it also handles well enough  but don t get happy and make any fancy moves out there or you ll be picking junk up off the road as a result  Inside the cab is a foldaway armrest which acts as an extra stash for CD s  your tape player  guns or whatever  It s a nice place to prop your elbow when alone  and will gladly make room for your Special Someone to cuddle up  The cushy seats also pull back enough to take advantage of what you will find to be an unreal amount of space  Hey  I fit my briefcase  a full semester of textbooks  a crowbar  a six pack of hard lemonade  baseball caps and dozens of assorted papers back there so you couldn t even see it  I don t know if those seats are gonna take that kind of abuse in 2006  but I won t bet against it  The vinyl steering wheel is starting to wear a bit  but the upholstery is standing up well  and the seats look like they re ready to go quite a few rounds It comes with a cool speaker system  and for a few bucks your car stereo dealer should be able to hook up something that ll make your cab come alive  Also  it s got a hideaway spare and jack that hasn t seen the light of day  CAUTION  this baby came with squeaky Firestone radials that haven t popped yet  but I m planning to swap them someday real soon and so should you All in all  this is a good looking  dependable little ride that will haul your stuff around smoothly for some time to come  Keep your oil changed regularly  drop a few bucks for upholstery cleaning once in a while  and the Ranger will reward you with reliable performance and low maintenance that you will long appreciate
