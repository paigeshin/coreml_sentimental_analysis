 I m sorry to say that the Ford Expedition I am writing about is not my own  it is my mother s  We bought it last year after our 8 year old Ford Aerostar died  This is one of the best cars I have ever driven and one of the biggest  You cannot drive this thing if you are used to driving anything smaller than a light truck  which includes most import sedans and sub compacts  This car commands the road  Not only are you sitting higher than you are in most cars  this car is only 2 quot  narrower than national highway specifications on minimum lane width  If you swerve back and forth in your lane often  get ready for an accident  With the Expedition  you have to keep it in line 100  of the time  You have to feel powerful when you are driving this car  you are in complete control of the road Well  not only is this car have some muscle  it has versatility  convenience  and luxury  Two rear 3 person seats plus the two front seats make this an 8 seater  The back seat sits up an extra 6 quot  over the front seat  but the ceiling is also lifted 4 quot  to allow for proper headroom  There are these very cool little air conditioning vents coming out of the ceiling  which can be pointed in any direction or closed off completely  If your kids want to listed to the radio  but you would like a nice quiet conversation in the front  just bring some headphones  The kids can plug in the headphones in the back and listen to their own tunes while the adults have a conversation in the front  There are a total of 4 headphone jacks  two for each 3 person seat  Both of the 3 person seats are removable  so taking provisions on any trip is not a problem  Skis  hockey equipment  and in our case  soccer equipment has plenty of room  There are a total of 8 cupholders  although one requires that part of a seat be in the down position  It has a keyless entry system and can be set to automatically lock when the keys get 20 feet away from the car
