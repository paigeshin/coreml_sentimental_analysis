 My wife and I are on our second Ford Ranger  We leased our first one two and a half years ago  We ve found that the Ranger is tough and reliable  Not a thing has gone wrong with either Ranger that we ve owned  The Ranger that we currently have is an extended cab model  which I highly recommend  The space that you get behind you seat is worth the expense  The jump seats come in handy when taking on unexpected riders  We also got the four door option  which is also very convenient  My only complaint with my 99 is that I wish I had gotten a bigger engine  as my new one is under powered  Leasing frightens a lot of consumers  we have found that there is nothing to be afraid about it  The first Ranger that we leased went over the given mileage by twenty thousand miles  But the Ford dealership that we went to forgave the mileage when we got our new one The Ford Ranger is a very good vehicle and I recommend it to anyone br br
