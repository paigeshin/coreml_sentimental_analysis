 I have always though of Ford as a crappy  non reliable company but ther Ford Explorer seems to always be good  What do they do different I have no Idea  I love this car though  It drives great and it could very well be the top truck in the country  atleast in my eyes it could be  I recommend this truck to everyone and it is a pretty good price also  It drives great on rough terrain  I go out to cape Cod and bring this truck through the beach and it drives great through there  I am telling you  this car is awesome  if you are smart you will listen to me You may think like me and say   quot  Ford is a crappy company Im not buying form them quot  but this is one hell opf a truck  and I suggest you get it br br
