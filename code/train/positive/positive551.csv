 I bought my wagon used in 1994  It s a 1992  Low mileage and price is what first brought me to this car  Upon test driving it though  I really found that I liked it even better  It was a nice ride  I m not one for mini van s or SUV s  so this was a good option for me  I ve never had trouble fitting anything and everything in this wagon  Put it this way  2 adults  1 child with car seat  luggage for 10 days  and 1 120lb dog all fit in this wagon  And the only problem that I have had is the fan that cool s the engine that should come on and off depending on temp  doesn t  and still cannot find anyone who can fix it  Though I have figured a way around it  I know that when this wagon need s to be replaced  no question in my mind  it will be another Escort Wagon br br
