 My husband and I like trucks for the fact that it does anything and everything you want  From moving yourself to transporting our dogs and anything else you need to going over terrain that most cars and some trucks can t even begin to handle  We have the extended cab version and it has six seats total  The only down fall is that the gas mileage is not that great  We average about 17 miles to the gallon  But there is two tanks that hold 32 gallons total so it is nice not having to hit the gas station so often  I also like the size you don t feel so small on the road parking is not that great but it is worth it for saftey reasons  I would recommend having a large vehicle for any family  I was in a wreck a drunk driver hit me from behind at about 50mph while we were sitting at a red light and We felt nothing it took out my bumper but that was all we were fine an the other van was very badly damaged  It pays to have a ford br br
