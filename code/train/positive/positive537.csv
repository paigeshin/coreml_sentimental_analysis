 I own a 1996 Ford Escort  I love it  Even though a 4 door it is still small enough to fit into the smallest parking space  which means alot to me  If your looking for a car that handles great in the winter  this is your car  This car is the most reliable car I ve owned yet  I bought it used and though 4 years old I havent had a single problem with it yet  Also though small it is still quite roomy  I think this car is an all occasions car  good for family  teenagers just starting out  or anyone  Also has an awesome heating system br br
