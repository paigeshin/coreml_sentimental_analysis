 I fell in love with the looks of this car the moment I saw one on the road  I finally got around to buying one last October  93 GT  73K miles  and I paid  5K for it Looks like the previous owner hadn t done much with it  I got it from a dealer  so within a month I had replaced the water pump and the muffler  both of which failed on my first long drive in the car  Cost me about 600 bucks for everything put together  but thats it    water pump replacement is part of the 60K service  which apparently wasn t done I ve currently got 91K miles on it  yes I drive quite a lot  and the only periodic expense has been the oil changes  At the 90K service I got the rear brakes changed and also the spark plug wires  total cost of service  400 or so  and since then things have been phenomenal  Its a lot of fun to blow off V 6 camaros and mustangs at stop lights  even though they catch up with you down the road  but I have only praise for the acceleration of this car My car is black  and I wash wax her every fortnight  and I get a lot of appreciative looks for the trouble  She s a good cruiser   I ve done two trips of 2000 miles and 1400 miles  with no complaints whatsoever The niggling points are 1  body noises on all but the smoothest roads   thats supposed to be a problem for all 93 probes though 2  the idling screws up sometimes   varies between 750rpm and 1200 rpm  but gets alright in an hour or so 3  the power antenna is stuck   another common probe problem Probes are cheap  I have seen 94 GTs with 70K for about  5000 recently  so if you get a cheap deal  buy it   you certainly will not regret it if you keep the car well  Forget about resale value though   you won t even get peanuts for this car  Since I plan to run mine until the bitter end  I m not concerned about that I ve also done a lot of driving on back roads  I think the turning cornering capabilities are pretty good too  Its a hard ride though   and I m too poor to replace the shocks  and takes some getting used to  The tires are dunlops  previous owner  and have decent grip  no fishtailing in the snow and that sort of thing If you want to buy this car  remember that the rear seat is strictly for emergency purposes I dont know why Ford put it in to begin with  This would have made a great 2 seater br br
