 My boyfriend has owned a  95 Ford Escort LX Wagon for almost two years now and it hasn t had any problems  When you see a Escort Wagon they re usually bought as business cars  ie Ikon  or family cars  There are many reasons for this  they re dependability and they re comfort  His car already has 185 000 miles on it  from road trips to Santa Cruz  and San Francisco  a lot of free way driving  but a lot of city wear too  Of the two years and probably 85 000 miles he put on it himself  there hasn t been a single problem  Giving it regular oil changes  and tune ups is the only expense you really have  You get about 25 mpg city and 30 freeway  The only problem with these cars  if you want to consider it a problem  is you can tell when it needs a service job  Like some cars that  quot try to let you know quot  when they need service by breaking down  this one gets a little little sluggish  as if to say  quot Ok  oil change please quot  or  quot Give me a tune up quot  If you re planning on buying your teen a car  or yourself  and don t have the money to spend loads on timing belts  radiators etc  This is the car to choose br br
