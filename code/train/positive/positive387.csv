 We bought our  97 F 150  Extended cab  XLT  Flareside  4x4  in 1998  It has the 5 4L V 8  We ve now had it for just over 2 years  We don t put much mileage on her and she just turned 4000 miles Our biggest complaint  is low fuel mileage  She s only getting about 10 2 mpg  That s all city driving It s roomy  sharp looking  runs great  probably not even broke in yet  and has plenty of interior room  Back seat folds down  so can use that area for cargo  without getting the seat dirty  The seats are comfy  the sound system is awesome It s nice to hit a button on the dash  to go into 4x4  rather than having to step out  to lock in hubs  That 5 4L V 8 has plenty of power  for towing a horse trailer  boat or r v We do love the look of the interior  but feel that Ford could use a little less plastic  for that caliber of vehicle br br
