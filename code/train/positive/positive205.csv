 Woohoo  I love this thing  It s way better than my Ford Mustang that I have  I have been driving my 99 Ford Explorer around quite a bit lately and I ve noticed that I can hit curbs  I can drive through the snow at speed limit  I can run of squirrels and not notice them  I could probably even take out a frew children in a school parking lot and never know  However  I wouldn t exactly call that a selling feature It s got some amazing pickup  It s V 8 makes it faster than my Mustang in pickup  but not in the long run  It would kill my car off the line  Snow is not a problem for this beast  I ve been driving in some great Michigan snow so far this year and I haven t slipped at all  Now  one issue is getting hit from the side  well  I m absolutely positive you d do a rollover if hit from the side  this thing almost rollsover when going through mountains after being hit by a heavy sidewind  It s big  but it doesn t have a very good center of gravity  thus making it an easy target to rollovers or other problems  But  if you get hit head on  or from behind  you will more than likely live  with it s cushy seats and major safety packages  It s also fun to play with  I love the little thing that tells what direction I m going in  normally called a compas  but it s just a thing when it s in a vehicle  I guess  It also tells you the temperature outside  the heat comes on really fast  it has all kinds of cool little things I can do with the seat  including tilting and deciding how high I want the seat  and how soft I want it  REALLY COOL I definitely recommend this baby  Go buy one right now  don t look at anything else  especially the 95 Mustang  it s flawed greatly and I know  I own one   br br
