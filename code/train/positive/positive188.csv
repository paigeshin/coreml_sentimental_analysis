 I have never been so in love with a vehicle  I just bought a used 2001 Ford Explorer XLT in wedgewood blue and it doesn t everything but brush my teeth for me b Interior  The interior is roomy without feeling like a huge machine  Everything you need is comfortably within reach and intuitively placed  No looking in the glove box to find the fuel door like on my  89 Mustang  The fan set on the coolest setting is just as cold as if the A C were running  The seat has several electronic controls for the perfect fit  The passengers in the backseat have access to climate control and radio adjustments  The trunk  however  is the best part of the interior  It has it s own floormat   what a riot  There is an exceptional amount of space and a clever roll out shade to conceal expensive items from potential thieves b Exterior  I find that the Explorer is attractive but modest  I think the two tone paints gives it extra class  I highly recommend the running boards  At 5 5  I need the boost  I m also enjoying the motorized sunroof  While I am still adjusting from driving a small sedan  I don t have trouble fitting into tight spots or trying to park  The Explorer is a nice compromise when it comes to size b The Rest  True  gas economy could be better   I get 15 miles to the gallon and drive a mixture of highway and city miles  However  I don t find that to be unreasonable for the type of vehicle it is  The V8 engine is responsive and gives the vehicle all the get up and go it needs  It can definitely get out of its own way  The handling is smooth and does not feel tippy at all  I drove a Tahoe once at thought I d roll at any moment For anyone looking at used SUV s  I highly recommend you test drive an Explorer  Don t be distracted by the fancy looks of the Xterra or the image of the Jeep Grand Cherokee  The Ford Explorer is the best value for the dollar in terms of performance  comfort  and size  And they look good  too
