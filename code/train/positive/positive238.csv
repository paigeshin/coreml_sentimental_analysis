 IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND NEED A VEHICLE A 5 year owner and I don t like FORDS  but I do like this one  I own a 1995 Ford Windstar and love it  I have had it long enough to know whether I d buy another or not  What really matters when owning a van in addition to reliability  How the vehicle holds up to a family  We are a young family of 5 and our 2 youngest  4  amp  5  have grown up with this being our only vehicle We have never had any major problems with the van and people still are amazed to find out that the Van is nearly 5 years old and still looks new  What I am getting at is that we have not done anything above normal maintenance and cleaning  maybe even a little less than the average person  and the van still looks good inside and out  The fabric does not show wear or stains  the carpet has maintained its look as well  The gas mileage  3 8 ltr engine  is a little less than I would like  about 23 highway and 15 city  The only things we ve had to replace or fix in five years is a power window motor and one a c relay switch
