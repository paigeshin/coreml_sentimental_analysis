 My sister purchased a new Ford Focus Hatchback ZX3 and I have had the chance to drive it around a ton  The weird part about it is I can t stop driving this little car  i love it  Now I know that is weird to say about a Ford  especially their affordable compact  but it s true  Ford has put together one of  if not the best  small cars on the market  The idea behind the Focus is to make a safe  reliable  and fun car that can be had in three body styles  hatchback  sedan  and wagon  I was personally expecting Ford to build a mediocre compact similar to the escort  but they certainly outdid themselves with this car The exterior of the Focus has yet to grow on me  It seems tall  oddly shaped and misproportioned  I am starting to get used to the  quot new edge quot  styling that Ford is employing  but I am not convinced that it makes a good looking or striking car  if anything it makes the car less striking and more boring  If this car had clean  sleek lines I think Ford would have had an even bigger winner than they have  Overall  for the money  the exterior is solidly built and in it s own way sporty  The one thing about the car that sets it apart though is its shape  especially the hatchback  people always seem confused on what they think about the car when they see it  The exterior of the car is not where the beauty is  as a matter of fact the interior isn t much better  the beauty of the car starts behind the wheel  This car is more fun than anyone could imagine from looking at it  The steering is crisp  gives good feedback  and can SERIOUSLY corner  You would think a car so tall would be washy on the road  but this thing can be tossed around  I was so surprised that at first I didn t believe it  I thought it was more of an illusion than reality  so I looked up the Focus  statistics in Car and Driver and I wasn t wrong  The car puts up slalom and skidpad numbers that rival cars such as the Camaro and Firebird  Now that is impressive for a compact that rounds out at  15000  I felt very sure of the car s footing and felt as if I had total control of the car at all times  Body roll was a little excessive  but still much better than 90  of American made cars  Back to the interior  there s really not a lot to say  Obviously  since it is a cheap car it is very basic  The ergonomics of the instruments are good  everything is in the right place and is easy to use  You also may notice the included air bags at no extra cost  a very responsible move by Ford that I appreciate  The great part about the interior is the build quality  it is much better than the escorts poorly built interior  As a matter of fact  with a little refinement  the Focus  build quality will be comparable to Honda and other Japanese companies Now that I have ranted and raved about this car  are there any downsides you ask  Yes  the engine  That is not to say it isn t sufficient  it just doesn t match the ability of the suspension system  The Zetec 4 cylinder is zippy  but does not have the punch you need for merging into highway traffic  If they could fit the 6 cylinder from the contour in this car it would be an absolute blast  The other downside is the suspension can be a little stiff at times  more than it could or should be  Some may also say the styling is a major problem  but I think if you get behind the wheel  the styling will be forgiven  My sister has not had the car long enough to see if it will be reliable or not  but it seems that it will be  Those are the only gripes  and for a car this price  that is amazing  Ford has put together exactly what they wanted to create  and they definitely did not forget the fun  This car could also catch on with the tuner crowd also  and if I was gonna build a boy racer  this would probably be the car I started with  it has the goods to be amazing  This is one GREAT car br br
