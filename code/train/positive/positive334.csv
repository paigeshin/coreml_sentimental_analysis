 I feel that you can not go wrong buying a Ford Escort  whether your buying it brand new or used My husband and I bought an  85 wagon two years ago  It had 130 000 miles on it when we got it  and now has about 300 000 miles on it  We ve taken it on several road trips  stuffed several people in it  and loaded it down the groceries  We also had an awesome Pioneer system in it  that should have  in all reality should have shook the car apart  A couple of time we with a month or so over on oil changes  and never had a problem with it  Eight months ago we discovered that the head gasket was blown  We decided to drive it until it blew up  Well guess what  it is still running like a champ  We also purchased an  87 Escort about six months ago  To our surprise it had the original  factory oil filter  tran  filter  spark plugs  and wires  The same parts for twelve years  I have never heard of any other car running on the original parts  Ford has definitely won us over  We don t plan on purchasing another vehicle any time soon  but if we where to buy one  it most certainly will be a Ford Escort
