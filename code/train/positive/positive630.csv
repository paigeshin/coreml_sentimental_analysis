 If you are someone who loves trucks but feel comfortable in a car as well  this is the truck for you  The Ford F 150 series has it all  They are very comfortable inside with features from basic vinyl and a radio to an extra port for utilities like a cell phone or a CD 6 speaker stereo  The ride is like being in a car instead of a truck because the suspension absorbs much of the bumps in the road  At the same time it can haul a truck load of rock and sand and still deliver control and smoothness The not so desirable features are that the side view mirrors are attached via plastic so they feel as though they are wearing out when you adjust the mirrors  Also  the standard and upgrade tires are a bit small for the muscular look of the body  Still  they do offer some nice alloy rims and good  long lasting tires Wether you are a mom  a single person  a business person  an outdoor person  construction worker  or a lover of trucks  you will be very pleased when you drive an F 150  You will want to recommend it to your friends and family  Take it from me  I have been in the Landscape Construction business for many years  this is the one  baby br br
