 We have owned our 1998 Ford Taurus for nearly two whole years and have had absolutely no problems or complaints  I would definitely choose this model over any other Ford car product  especially a probe  The car has more power than you can imagine with a V6 installed  It will go from zero to sixty in just a few seconds  I have never rode in a faster car than this one  It is not even considered a sports car and still has the engine and a semi sporty type look  The car gets excellent gas mileage  too  On the highway it rides perfectly smooth without any bumps or loud  annoying noises that most cars make  It even has cruise control  I would be going 65 and let off the cruise control on the highway  and the car would still be between 60 and 65 for almost a whole entire mile  I thought this was incredible  It is comfortable for five and even six people to fit comfortably  The seats are very spacious and comfortable  especially in the back  I could live in the back of this car if I chose  there is so much room  The trunk is also full of vacant space as well  The front has an endless amount of compartments and unique options to make it easier for both the driver and passengers  It has airbags for both front seats to improve the safety  and also has air conditioning  You can add a disc changer to the car if you desire which would be very convenient because the receiver is programmed for this  You will just have to switch from radio to cd player and there is no hassle  Ford could have done away with their rather large  round receivers and installed a regular sized one which makes it easier to install your own cd player  but I guess a cd changer was a good idea  The Ford Taurus would be ideal for a large family of five  It is the perfect car for the cheap price that it is  It handles well in all four seasons  I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking at buying a car that will last a long while  It is worth a test drive or at least a look inside
