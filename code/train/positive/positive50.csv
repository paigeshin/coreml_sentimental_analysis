 Get an old Tempo and stick to your beat   Yes  we re talking music here   I have been and still am the proud owner of three Ford Tempos  A l987  a 1989 and a l990  I am a woman who drives approximately 40 to 80 miles a day in all kinds of weather  I am a consistent driver  in that I keep relatively the same speed for the same length of time while commuting to and from work  These cars are easy to drive and easy to control  They are great in snow and icy conditions  They have a front wheel drive that s excellent WITHOUT snow tires  and I live in Northern New York State  near the Canadian border  The gas mileage is great and at a steady pace of just below 55 miles and hour I use almost no gas at all  If you re a careful driver  mind the speed limit and don t peel out too often  I d sure recommend a Tempo to you  There s just nothing about these low key cars I don t like  I ve been driving them for 12 years  Blue Book value should increase  in my opinion  br br
