 Don Garlits  the  quot Big Daddy quot  of drag racing  is who I think of after test driving a new 1998 Ford Mustang GT  Before driving one  I thought of the Mustang as just another sporty looking spineless car for secretaries and factory workers to flog to work and back When we climbed into the car s black interior  I instantly noticed the exceedingly plasticky dashboard  the uncomfortable seat  the flimsy door panel  the obstructed rear view and the infant sized rear seat  Although the actual driving position was nearly perfect   steering wheel  shifter and brakes were precisely where I needed them to be  I was pretty sure the car s only redeeming feature was the brand cache of the horse dancing on the grill As soon as I turned the key  I knew I was wrong  Ford s 4 6 liter modular V 8 emits a tense growl through the exhaust pipes at idle  Blipping the throttle was a sensory experience  even at a standstill  An engine with a snarl like this one means  business i  even if its 230 horsepower is lower than the perennial competitor  the Camaro  I slipped the perfectly angled shifter into first and idled   no  make that  burbled  out to the road First gear came and went with a mechanical howl  and second gear did much the same  Then my wife informed me   quot we re already going 40 quot  And so we were  in about as much time as it takes to read this  The city ended  and the road opened up into a divided highway and I explored the 40 70mph roll on power  With a muted scream  the  Stang accelerated straight up to speed At cruise  however  the mechanical noise which is so electrifying under acceleration became plain old noise  making conversation hard in the pony car  I could imagine long road trips with this car becoming an exercise in the  quot What did you say quot  maneuver But then I came to the next stoplight   yes  on a divided highway  and had a chance to dip into the V 8 s strong point  Burnouts   a la  Mr  Garlits  I am proud to say that I executed a perfect right hand throttle turn  bringing the rear around smartly and hooking the tires back up to rocket off down the next road When we returned to the Ford dealer  my heart was beginning to settle down  and we had stopped our crazy talk of canceling our order for a new Volvo which at that time was in the works  Summed up  the Mustang GT has a marvelous engine  transmission and brakes in search of a comparable car  because as soon as the ignition was switched off  the uncomfortable seat  creaky dashboard and all the rest were back again the wonderful  machismo  of V 8 s and  quot Big Daddy quot  burnouts simply can t overcome it  and the insurance companies who underwrite it will be happy to tell you the same thing The Mustang GT  It s a beautiful car to drive  but I couldn t imagine living with one br br
