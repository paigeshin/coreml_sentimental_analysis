 I had the opportunity to test drive the 2001 Escape after salivating over all the press clippings and related media hype for about 6 months  Because I couldn t contain my excitement  I went to my local Mazda dealership and drove the Escape s sister SUV  Mazda Tribute  base model 4x4  V6  almost a month before the Escape made its bow in early September  The drive was a little less than acceptable  especially frustrating when I schooled the salesman on every single aspect of the SUV  but I wanted the Escape  Passing by the Ford dealership late on a Sunday evening  there she was Quick background  I own a 2000 Nissan Xterra  V6  4x4  loaded  and I love and loathe it  Extremely comfortable and quiet ride  nice stock stereo and accessories  The engine is horribly inefficient and lacks power  Thus  the need to try the Escape on for size Getting into the Escape would be no problem for all but the tallest members of America  My two kids easily climbed in and found the seat belts   If you are trying to save a little money  think about passing on the side step bars  They cannot hold much weight  and since the Escape is about 4 6 inches shorter than other full sized SUV s  there is a good chance you won t ever use them  One advance warning that the insulation wasn t going to be as good as other SUV s was the  quot thump quot  of the doors  Instead of closing with a warm  quot thump quot  the doors sounded like something off of a less expensive model  Once in  I found the 6 way seat a nice feature  along with the no frills dashboard and controls for the fans and sunroof  The stereo was a bit too complicated  but sounds much better than the upgraded stereo in the sister Mazda Tribute  Leather seats are stiff  but I am sure they would soften a little after a while  The model also had privacy glass  which I recommend  I had a chance to compare some of the interior dimensions for the Escape  and the numbers really shocked me  The Escape is as wide as an Explorer  only 17 inches shorter than an Xterra  had more leg room than the Xterra  There are some other interior dimensions for the Escape that are as big  if not bigger  than some of the bigger  thirstier and more expensive SUV s  Some over  10K more  I was anxious to feel the 200 HP V6 matched to this yellow  baby SUV bullet  and it passes every test I put it through  Passing and accelerating are excellent  even up hills and with four average sized passengers  It tends to downshift a little quicker than I expected when pressed  but a small tradeoff for an engine that bests any other SUV with that kind of power weight by at least 5 7 mpg  Another trade off is the road noise  I found it was more pronounced than I would have liked  and I was raising my voice to talk to the other passengers  A little more padding and insulation in the doors would do well for the noise   Hint  hint  Ford  I was able to have the experience of the night driving dash and gauge lights  and I wasn t impressed  During the daylight  the dash gauges are very impressive  The night time greenish red hue would take a little getting used to  Handling is wonderful for the Escape  Cornering is just like a car  The Escape is confident in all phases of a town or country drive  Quick note  I have read some of the other excellent reviews of the Escape  and air conditioning was mentioned as a problem area  I live in the North West  Seattle  WA  so we rust instead of bake  I did not test the AC  but the fan seemed to work as it should If you have passed on the Xterra  Montero Sport and CRV for lack of power  Jeep Cherokee for persistent mechanical problems and the Rav 4 for the looks power problems  the 2001 Ford Escape is an excellent choice  I also suspect that it will keep its resale value very well  Keep in mind the 2003 gas electric Escape that is said to get over 35 mpg and still has the same amount of horsepower  For those who just want to get into this SUV and don t have the  23 25K it will take to adequately equip the 4x4 V6 model  seriously consider the 4x2  5 speed  Even with a little bit of equipment  you can have a respectable SUV for under  20K br br
