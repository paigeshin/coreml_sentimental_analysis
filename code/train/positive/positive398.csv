 I love my 2000 Mustang  The car that I traded in was a 1992 Ford Mustang convertible  That car gave me a few problems  but I went ahead on and tried another Ford  I was looking for a new car because I was ready to get married  My husband went with me  We both fell in love with this car  I have a Bright Atlantic Blue Mustang  It is a pretty color  I don t see very many of the same color as mine  The interior is light gray and dark gray  The seats are light gray My car has only given me one problem  The air conditioner vents did not turn from side to side  I took the car to the local Ford dealership and told them  They looked at the car and ordered the parts  I took the car back in and they put in new air conditioner vents  This is the only problem I have had  The car is great  The interior of the car is a light gray  The car is an automatic  It has power windows  power door locks  cd player  tape player  cruise control  automatic driver seat  automatic mirrors  overdrive and It has an anti theft device built into the car  If someone doesn t have the right key  the car will not start  I had a key made at Wal Mart and it will unlock the doors  but you can t use it to drive the car with  It also has a remote control for the car  It has lock and unlock for the doors  trunk and panic button The driver panels are the speed  oil gage  temperature gage  gas gage and the battery  It also has lights that light up for different reasons  like the seatbelt  overdrive off  or low fuel  The seatbelt warning goes off every now and then  if you don t buckle your seatbelt up The gear shift is located in between the seats  It has park  reverse  neutral  drive  2  and 1  The overdrive button is located on the gear shift  There is a console in between the front seats  It has slots inside if for cd s  There is also a change tray located between the gear shift and the console  The doors also have  pockets  to place objects in  When I am out on the highway and I want to  get up and go  it goes  Some cars that I have had before if you push the gas it is still going the same speed  Not this one  You want to go  it goes  The car s body style has not changed much over the last few years  I has just been the head lights and tail lights that change  The body is just about the same as it was when they changed to this body style in 1994  The inside of the car is great  I love having the tape deck and the cd player  I have lots of cds but I also have quite a few tapes so that gives me more of an option of what I can listen to  The control panel for the cd player  the tape deck and the air conditioner are all in the middle  That makes it easy to get to for the driver The cruise control is located on the steering wheel  The buttons are cruise  coast  and resume  Cruise is to set it  Coast to slow down  Resume to go back to the speed that you were at before  The windshield wipers are on the side of the steering column  This is also the same as the blinkers and the headlight brightner dimmer  The emergency blinkers are on the top of the steering column  The headlights are on the left side of the steering wheel  There is an interior light for when the doors are open  When you get into the car and close the door  the light stays on until you start the car  This is very helpful at night time to see the ignition  When you get out the light also stays lit until you lock the doors  It also goes off automatically This car has an automatic window defroster for the back window  This helps in the winter time to defrost ice and snow  The heater has defrost  floor and mix  Mix is the floor and defroster  The heater air conditioner is a round circle that goes from cold to hot  blue to red  The air conditioner has max a c  normal a c  and vent  The max blows a little harder than the normal  Vent is just for outside air  The only thing that I don t like is that the seats could be a little softer than what they are  I love the automatic seat for the drivers side  There is not one on the passenger side  But they are ok  The front seats are bucket seats  The back seat is two different seats  They lay down to the inside  In case you have something in the trunk  There is not much leg room in the back seat  It is comfortable enough for my son  He is only five  so he is comfortable in the back seat  Most adults would not be comfortable in the back seat  unless they are short  I have ridden in the back seat  I am 5 5  and there is enough leg room for me  But it is not for very tall people The trunk has an automatic opener on the key chain and also inside the glove box  There is also a safety feature on the inside of the car s trunk  There is a cord to pull in case you get locked in the trunk  to pop the trunk from the inside  The trunk is carpeted and has the donut tire underneath the carpet  It is a pretty roomy trunk for a sports car  My car has a spoiler on the trunk  There is a third brake light in the spoiler This car drives great  The car accelerates when you want it to  It is a fun little car to drive  The brakes also work well  When you need to stop and stop fast  it does  The cars performance driving is great  It takes off and slows down when you want to  It handles the road good  It is easy to drive  I love everything else about my car  My next car after this one will more than likely be another Mustang  They have me sold on this  little pony  If you have not ever had a Mustang you need to drive one  You might really want one after you do  Thank you for reading  Have a good night Kimberly
