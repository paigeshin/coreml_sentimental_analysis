 The ford Taurus is a great car for young or old  i didn t want to by it by name   but when i sat in it and test drove it  it was quick for me to change my opinion  When i found out the facts about the Taurus i was pretty impressive  The safety on the car was excellent  a lot lower to insure than other cars  it drove real good and had lots of peep  There wasn t to much i didn t like about the car  it at more gas than my old four cylinder engine  but not much  and it sure out powered it  This is a great overall car with class  and is a car four just about anyone
