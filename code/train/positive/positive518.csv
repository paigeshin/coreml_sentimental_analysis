 Currently own Dark Wedgewood  Eddie Bauer Edition  4 x 4  I am impressed with the fit and finish of the interior  and the convenience items  Most impressive is the note recorder and garage door opener on the sunvisor  what a surprise and delight when I discovered this feature  Very useful  The acceleration is very good at the bottom end while not so impressive at the top end  The automatic 4 wheel drive feature is also very useful  it just switches to 4 wheel drive when you need it  The vehicle is very stable and comfortable at higher speeds unlike previous year models I have owned  While the styling is a little long in the tooth  I still like the current design  looks very sporty and strong  I personally like the size  just right  I had an Expedition before and found it to be a little big  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a very good looking  stable  and roomy SUV br br
