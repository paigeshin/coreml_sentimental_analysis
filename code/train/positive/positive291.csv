 the 1990 year ford taurus is a excellent family car there is ample room for cross town trip or cross country trips  the ford taurus gives you a very reliable means of transportation and you get very good gas mileage on average i get 27 mpg in town and 36 mpg highway  this car is a good car for some one with a family but i would not recommend that you get a taurus for a young adult if they a sports car kind of driver it is not made to be driven like that  the ford taurus does have very well take off and is a very reliable car and very comfortable car to drive or ride in br br
