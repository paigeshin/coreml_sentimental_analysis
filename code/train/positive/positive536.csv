 When I was shopping for a newer vehicle I wanted something that would get me back and forth to work  and something that was fun to drive on weekends  I think I got both  So far  I have taken my 97 Explorer Sport four wheeling in places most people wouldn t take their beat up off roaders  I have taken it on trails in the woods  through swamps  and through a few snow drifts  And  when I was done playing  I took it to the car wash  hosed it off  put a new coat of wax on it  and it was ready to go to work on Mondays Like any vehicle  there were some minor problems  one was a bad sensor for the 4 wheel drive selenoid  The truck would shift into 4 low and not come out until I would shut it off and start it again  That was fixed under warranty  and hasn t occoured since  Other than that  the usual maintenance items are all that needed replacing on this truck I would recommend it to anyone looking for a functional  and fun vehicle  It rides and handles great on and off road
