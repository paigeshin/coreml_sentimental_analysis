 I bought my Bronco in 1999  It was an  89 XLT with only 84 000 miles on the clock  and it showed  The 89  is the same as the  90  which is why I posted it here  I bought this vehicle because I was moving to Northern Iowa and I had a 2WD 1986 GMC Sierra Classic with 160 000 on the clock  and needed something new for Iowa s winter weather  This Bronco was a one owner and I paid a fairly reasonable price for it  People who don t know much about truck models think it is new  There is plenty of interior space  and seats 5 very comfortably  No one has to ask me to move my seat up  It has a 302 V 8 which is plenty of power for this vehicle  The previous owner towed his RV with this rig  I have actually tried to get this tank stuck and had difficulty at doing so with the 33 quot  tires it is equipped with right now  As a previously stated  this Bronco is a tank  It is 11 years old and runs great  sounds great  and looks great  One thing Broncos tend to do is wander when traveling in a straight line  It is not recommended for people who will only drive it around town  Elderly people and or people wearing skirts  dresses  or high heels may have trouble climbing in this vehicle  You must also be prepared to get 13 18 MPG  and even lower in four wheel drive  The Bronco is great for someone who needs a dependable  powerful  and comfortable four wheel drive vehicle at a reasonable price
