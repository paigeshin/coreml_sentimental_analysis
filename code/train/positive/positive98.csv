 OVERVIEW I ve been a Ford man my entire life  They truly are the best made automobiles in the world  Anyway  the 2 door Explorer Sport is definitely my favorite  It s an all around great looking vehicle  and I always get tons of compliments about it LIKES I am very particular about my vehicles  and the Explorer still met all my needs  Leather seats  power seats and windows  moon sun roof  cd tape radio deck  thermometer compass  and rear temp and stereo controls are all the great options I got  I think it is very smooth riding  even for a SUV  While its only built for four adults comfortably  five can still fit  except you are short a seatbelt  DISLIKES There are not many things I do not like about the Explorer Sport  I do wish it had the on board computer that 4 door Explorer Limited and Eddie Bauer have  Its just nice to know exactly how much gas you have left  your mileage  and instantly know your systems diagnosis of potential problems  all of which the inboard computer provides DRIVING Driving the Explorer Sport is awesome  In late April of 2000 I was at an overnight camping party  No tent needed  just fold down the back seats and throw a sleeping bag back there  Well overnight it started pouring and never stopped  We were at the end of the muddiest minimum maintenance road I ve ever seen  While everyone else got there cars trucks stuck on this muddy road  I flipped into 4 Wheel Drive Low and drove through a muddy cornfield for 5 miles  It was great The Explorer drives well in any conditions  I especially likes it 4 wheel drive handling  It is just great WHO SHOULD SHOULD NOT BUY I really don t think you can go wrong with the Explorer Sport  Since there are only two doors  dealing with little children and child seats  is probably not suggested  But for singles  a young married couple  an extra work pleasure auto  or even a truck replacement this is a perfect vehicle br br
