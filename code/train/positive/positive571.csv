 I have had Ford F250 s in both 7 3 and 6 9 diesels  Both have great power and reliability  The 6 9 was a 1985 model with over 300 000 miles on it  The 7 3 is a 1991 model  Both are 4 wheel drive and were used on the farm to pull stock trailers  Both get about the same fuel mileage  which is about 17 mpg highway unloaded  and about 10 12 mpg pulling a 16  loaded stock trailer  Both also have 4 10 rear ends  which I think is a little low  but they sure do pull good  The thing I like about the 91 model is the 5 speed transmission  the 85 is a 4 speed  The bad thing about a 4 speed is they top out at about 75 or 80 mph  the 5 speed tops out at about 95  It has no trouble maintaining about 75 to 80 mph on level ground and slight hills  big hills will of course slow it down  but not to an unacceptable speed  Ford s diesel engine is made by International  the Powerstroke is basically a 7 3 with a turbo and modified injectors  My 91 has about 240 00 miles on the engine and still runs great and will not burn any oil I have been very pleased with both My next truck will probably be a Ford F250 with a Powerstroke br br
