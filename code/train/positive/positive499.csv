 In the beginning  When we bought or first SUV 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee it worked just fine for us  it was just us and our big yellow labrador  It gave us the right amount of room and comfort that we needed at that time Fast forward  Three kids later and we still have the lab In 2000 we leased our first Excursion  V10 Limited  This was driven daily by my wife to and from school with the kids  If it 146s acts like a bus  We used it like a bus  She is only 5 4 at best  and had no problem driving this truck  Not a nick on a bumper in two years  Bottom line  it did a great job hauling two strollers  three kids a dog and who ever else needed to go some where  Great for Vacations too  The long rides to Florida down the dreaded route 95 corridor  All kids learn to hate this ride  We could actually fit all the stuff for vacation without the roof carrier  By the way  really kills gas mileage too  So  another environmentally friendly plus for the big truck  It was actually a pleasure to have enough room to be comfortable all the way down without killing each other  And the fact that it does have a 44 gallon gas tank is a god send on very long trips  Especially when going through states that don 146t have stations every two miles or when driving through the night when most stations are closed Inside  The interior is comfortable enough without being one of those sissy SUV 146s  All I was missing was my remote and I would have been right at home  The sound system is fantastic and the kids love the fact that the windows went all the way down  Even with Baby seats all have enough room to spread out  A full size cooler fits in the center just behind the front seats making the outer seats usable for passengers  And you still have room for 3 more in the third row Access is better then the GM trucks  The tri door makes access to the rear cargo area simple  The fact that you do not loose the rear wiper as you would on the GM Barn door style is a plus  When all seats are removed you can fit 25 pieces of sheet rock laying down  or one queen size futon in tact Towing  Don 146t kid yourself this puppy has neck wrenching torque  I 146m not sure what the other reviews perception was based upon because  I also own a Shelby if this is any indication of knowing torque  Look at the towing ratings and you decide  I 146ve had well over 8000 pounds on the back and boy did it drive like nothing was behind me  Enough said about that  This is a great towing truck Ride  The long wheel base gives the Excursion the ride of a Limo   A 4x4 Limo  Because of the length it floats down the road  We definitely notice a better ride in the 2003 then the original 2000  The shocks are not as harsh and it does not bounce around as much as the 2000 did Bad Roads    And not to mention bad roads  The roads in the State of New Jersey kills more cars then bad drivers  Statistically this may not be true  but have you ever hit a large pot hole followed by a series of whoop de doos  Not something you want to attempt in a non SUV  I 146ve seen these roads tear off wheels  Again creating large traffic jams during rush hour  Another mass waste of fossil fuel and commuters time   ok that was another stretch  but you get the point City Roads  New York City will kill a vehicle just as quickly as a off road Baja race  People say  147People who buy SUV 146s never take them off road 148 you do not have to take it off road to have the same experience  Try a romp around NYC and see how quick a lesser truck would crumble the torture of the urban roads  If you ever danced fender to fender with a Yellow Cab you certainly understand why in the city size does matter maintenance  After 24 months and 36 000 miles  Oil every 3 000 miles  tire rotation after every 12 000 miles and that is it  not a problem and never back for any warranty work Consolidation is being environmentally friendly  As far as being environmentally friendly  We live in the NY Tri State area and during one of the family outing to the Bronx Zoo we invited another family to come with us  We all fit in the Excursion  So what  you may say  Well  by car pooling we kept one additional vehicle off the already crowded roads and actually saved resources  It may be a stretch  but none the less  true The bad news  After the 2 year lease was up and we went back to the dealer  we had every intention of buying the truck back from Ford  Well  as luck would have it  the buy back was very high  and they wanted almost  30 000 to buy it back  Being that it was out of warranty at this point we decided that a nice shiny new 2002 Ford Windstar Limited was the way to go  It too had all the bells and whistles for family use  Video  auto sliding doors  remote start and the tow package  All the features a mom of three could want  Life in the Minivan  We did a few long road trips to Indiana and florida with the Windstar  it drove great  but buy were we a little tight  For the extra space that was needed  the roof carrier came out of mothballs again  Albeit the gas mileage was better in the mini van  but the need for space was greater Snow and Bad weather  Even with optional traction control it was not the best in the snow  Maybe we just got used to the Jeep and the Excursion 146s 4 wheel drive  The Excursion  3 feet of snow and no issues The move  A year and a half into the Windstar we decided that we really needed the larger vehicle  So  I waited for the 2004 Excursions to roll off the assembly line  This forced the dealers to clear out the 2003 stock  And for the first time it really did work in my favor  0  financing   4 000 off from Ford  Smack the dealer around a little more and they will drop another  2 000 off  This was great  We had our pick of styles  colors and options Sales may be down  but it sure did give me allot of vehicles to choose from We purchased a beautiful black 2003 Limited Excursion  It is smoother and quitter then the 2000  The fit and finish is much better then the original  The V10 was great in the first one  so we had no reservations about another V10  They are powerful enough to propel a 32 foot motor home  they can certainly handle the excursion  Although  I would have liked the 6 0 Diesel the  4 000 uplift was a bit much to handle  It really did blow the monthly payment out of the window The competition  We also looked at the Suburban and the Yukon XL  Best kept secret  we got allot more truck for allot less money  The Chevy and GMC were over 10k more and the incentives were not as good  The 1500 platform did not equal the class of the Excursion  for it to be apples to apples you would have to buy a 2500 series and load it up  The Ford by far was the better deal  And hey  147It 146s a FORD TRUCK 148 Enough of the Ford commercials  Bottom line  The Excursion might not be as environmentally friendly as my Honda Insight 70 MPG  But  that is my work vehicle that I drive over 25 000 miles per year  Just as the insight fits my needs during the week  the excursion fits my wife s needs If ford made a Hybrid Excursion that got 70 MPG I 146d buy it  But they don 146t  and the excursion suits our lifestyle today My thoughts  Great truck  Great Value  If you can 146t run with the big boys go to the back of the bus  Pun intended This is a great vehicle if you have children  alot of stuff  need to move and tow large and heavy things  Not right for everyone  but if you have any of the above needs this vehicle is for you People who don 146t have children and never owned an Excursion should not write about it  Very well written review  for a single person who drives a little toyota  Try 1000 pounds of cement in the back of your echo  Oh yea  that would take 33 3 trips  Who is being environmentally friendly now  Would love to see what you say about the Porsche 911 ps   a note from the wife  I am the primary driver of this truck and I love it  I just wanted to respond to the negative comments written    I am only 5 4 and I have never once had a visibility issue or a maneuverability issue  Which leads me to believe that the 6 146 tall guy who borrowed his bosses truck is a REALLY BAD DRIVER  And by the way  even in your best dream  the Odyssey doesn 146t come close to the interior space of an Excursion  In response to the couple making the penis jokes   guess what   I DON 146T HAVE A PENIS    because I am a mother of three  Maybe it is you who has the penis envy  And one last thing  the suv 146s that park too close or take up too much space have nothing to do with the truck  it has everything to do with the inconsiderate driver   which I am not If this makes no sense  read other reviews
