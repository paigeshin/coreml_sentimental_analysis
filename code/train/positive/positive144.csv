 We went to a dealership where a friend worked  so we knew that we wouldn t be  quot taken quot  for a ride  And we looked and looked  wanting an extended cab  4x4 pickup with Air conditioning  But in our price range the extended cab was out of the question  amp  hard to find  So we ended up with a 1993 4x4 Pickup with A C and cruise control  It had 35K miles on it when we got it in 1996  amp  it has been great to us  It has bucket seats with a little  quot bench quot  type seat between them so that our daughter can sit in the middle  It drives very nicely  amp  isn t all that bad on the gas mileage  We haven t had to use the 4x4 feature that often  but when we have it has met or exceeded our expectations all the time  One thing I really like about the 1993 model is that the body style is so similar to the current style that many times people think our truck is New  Kind of nice that Ford hasn t changed the body style much over the last few years We haven t put that many miles on the truck in the 4 years we have had it  since it is our second vehicle  but we hope that will help preserve the value of the vehicle
