 The Explorer is the best equipped  most reliable  and the most comfortable in its class When my wife and I decided to buy and SUV we looked at them all  the Rodeo  Pathfinder  Blazer  and 4Runner  Although the Pathfinder and 4Runner were very nice they just couldn t touch the complete package offer by the Explorer I have a 9 month old and a dog  The Explorer makes traveling them the two of them a breeze  The carseat fits great in the back  and the dog loves being out of the weather  My wife loves how easy it is to get the stroller in and out of the explorer vs  the Ford Contour For value  comfort  resell value  and safety look no further than the Ford Explorer br br
