 Let me explain to you in detail what I have before I review the car  I own a silver 1992 5 0L HO Mustang GT  I bought the car used and I am the third owner of the car  The car has been taken care of really well  which enables me to make an accurate review of the car itself  The engine is a stock Ford 5 0L HO engine with the exception of new headers and under drive pulleys  The radiator has been replaced with a 3 core radiator  The suspension has been modified with adjustable shock  you can adjust how smooth or tight you want it to ride  My review is with the setting to  3  being the middle  The settings are  1  for smooth ride and  5  for tight ride  The radio has been replaced with a JVC CD deck along with a trunk mounted 12 disc CD changer  The exhausts have been replaced by Steeda with high flow exhausts but are not the straight pipe ones you ve all seen on the road  These on the outside look like the standard ones which almost hide underneath the bumper  They are called Steeda  Whisper  exhausts for reference purposes Ok  first of all  let me address the so called  Whisper  exhausts  Let me tell you that I am completely clueless on why they call them that  the car is in no way quiet  Instead it sounds like pure muscle  not like I m complaining  it s a beautiful sound Anyway  on with the car  The car comes standard with a 5 0L HO Ford V8  Which I must say is a fine piece of machinery  Even though compared to today s 4 6L V8 which puts out 260hp  the 5 0L s 225hp might seem very modest  However  don t disregard it just yet  The 5 0L engine gives out more than enough power on a wider range than a lot of cars I ve driven I will explain what I mean by this  but first I want to clear something up about engines and power  When they give you a horsepower rating  they should give a corresponding rpm number  This is the revolutions per second the engine is turning  The reason for this is that depending on how fast the engine is turning  the number of horsepower is different  Obviously the higher the rpm the higher the horsepower  However  with some cars that advertise a great amount of horsepower or a great amount of torque  they usually mean at an extremely high rpm  such as 6000 or above  This horsepower is almost useless in initial acceleration  Most Japanese small engine cars that try to advertise ridiculous horsepower numbers use this technique  read into it further and you ll find that it ll be at those extremely high rpms which is close to redline and can damage the engine if brought to it enough  The main problem with this is that most of the horsepower and torque won t kick in until the engine is spinning so fast  So basically anywhere before that you won t feel barely anything The engine in the Mustang  however  is different  I ve found that I m stuck to my seat from the very beginning all the way up to 70mph or more  I did this little test one day on an empty turnpike  The speed limit was 70mph  so when I stopped to pay the toll  I floored it coming out of the toll plaza  The car returned excellent response all the way up to 70mph  This means the car has a really good midrange  which is the best to have The interior looks fairly nice  the instrument panel is fairly well arranged and I like the inclusion of an oil level gauge  Most cars have this by now  but like the car I had before  a 1990 Acura Integra  some cars didn t  Some things I don t like about the interior is the plastic  A lot of the dash is plastic  and that bothers me  it s so cheap feeling  However it isn t especially cheap or nasty looking  so that s not too bad  but I would prefer at least vinyl  There is some vinyl though  The middle storage box is very small  and doesn t really hold much  mainly just a pair of sunglasses and the little remote for my CD player  Also it is positioned too far back  you have to bend your wrist a lot to reach the button and to flip it open  then you d have to look down and back to see what s inside to know what to get  Also  I don t like how the trunk release button is located inside the glove compartment On the positive note  there are enough good things about the features to let you overlook some of the slight annoyances of the interior  After 1991 airbags were required as standard  so the 1992 Mustang obviously has one  which is a little reassuring after driving the 1990 Acura without an airbag for so long  Also  it has power windows  power locks  power steering  power brakes  cruise control  everything  And also everything works  As long as it has been maintained  everything should still work even after 10 years Mine is an automatic transmission car  It has all the standard settings but unlike the Japanese cars have the overdrive feature too  I kind of hoped they would switch the placement of the overdrive with the regular drive  The way they have it configured now is  from top to bottom  Park  Reverse  Neutral  Overdrive  Drive  1st gear  I m used to simply counting the number of notches when going from setting to setting  I m used to one notch down for reverse  then two more notches down to get into drive  now I have to go three  That s not too horrible of a problem  but the fact is  regular drive would be used more  so it should come first  The way it is now  is that when I m in drive  the two most likely settings for the shift to accidentally get knocked into is overdrive and 1st gear  Slipping into overdrive while driving is no big deal  but if I would accidentally knock it to 1st gear I can probably majorly damage the transmission  especially if I m driving fast  which isn t hard to do in this car  Another thing that I don t like about the shifter is that there is no display on the dash what setting you re in  I liked it when I can see on the instrument panel what I m in instead of having to look down if ever I m unsure  However  these are easily overlooked  they are just the little annoyances I ve noticed The automatic transmission works pretty efficiently  In regular drive  you ll be able to feel the car very accurately  The transmission  like all other automatics  would  kickdown  a gear when it senses the gas pedal is depressed harder or more  The only thing is that at the higher gears  it tends to not want to kickdown unless I REALLY step on the gas  However with this motor kickdown at the higher gears is not really required to get decent acceleration  but it s there if you really need it On overdrive  it drives identical to the regular drive on all speeds under about 50 55mph  After that point  it will go into overdrive  In overdrive you ll notice that the car will have very little acceleration response  This is because it is trying to be more fuel efficient  Despite the lack of acceleration response  this setting is really nice on long trips  since at overdrive it accomplishes 70mph with only 1500rpms from the engine  which is down right incredible  Normally in my Acura Integra the engine will be spinning at about 3500rpms to get up to 70mph  This big HO engine gives almost no effort at 70mph  That is especially good not only for gas mileage but for the life of the engine  The more stress the engine is put through the shorter the life will be  With the 5 0L HO engine you don t need to worry about that since it requires little effort to get the same speeds accomplished by Japanese sports cars I really don t have to speak of the exterior  anyone who sees my car immediately compliments me on how beautiful it is  Some people might not appreciate it as much  but in good condition it just simply looks good  The front has very bold designing with the large hood area and the flat  mean looking front including the awesome looking round fog lamps on the bottom From the side you notice the ground effects the most  Most people have mistakenly thought that I put a body kit on the car  They don t realize the car needs no body kit  it looks that good stock from Ford  The car is sitting on aluminum alloy 16  rims  which for that year is the newly designed 5 point star design in opposed to the 1990 and before  turbine  style 15  wheels The rear of the car is a hatchback design  This is where most of the complaints lie  I say MOST  but that s out of very few total complaints  you generally don t hear very many negative points on the Mustang GT s body design  The rear of the car is quite small  The rear wheels are almost sitting at the corners  However they executed it quite well  One of the first things you notice about the back is the big spoiler rear wing  This  unlike the ones you see on Japanese cars teenagers customize  is a functioning rear wing  It directs some of the air flow up and outward to put slightly more pressure on the rear wheels at high speed to maintain grip and to provide better grip on the rear wheels during braking  On rear wheel drive vehicles  you will definitely need this That is why tire manuals would instruct for the new tires to be placed on the back wheels despite what most people think  even if it is a front wheel drive car  The reason for this being  the last thing you want is to lose grip on the rear wheels  If you ever lose traction of the rear wheels your back end would get lose and you ll probably go into a spin The brake lights  indicators  and reverse indicators are all packaged together in a group covered by a grill like design so the light goes through in many tiny slots  It s hard to explain  but it is very attractive  and like the body kit mistake  a lot of people mistaken this as a custom thing done to the rear light  but this is the way the car comes stock from Ford The sound of the car is also excellent  I ve heard 5 0L Mustangs with the standard exhausts and they sound decent  but the real magic of the 5 0L engine is best expressed with hi flow exhausts such as the Steeda exhausts or the ever popular Flowmaster exhausts  The sound of the Ford 5 0L HO engine is actually REALLY distinct  A trained ear can easily tell a Mustang from other sports cars even ones with similar sized engines  It is not that annoying weed whacker sound you hear from the big exhaust tips  or  cherry bombs  you see so much of these day  instead you can hear the rumble of the engine and the separation between the firing of different pistons  and it s a GREAT sound  reminds you of the muscle car age back in the 60 s and 70 s All in all  it is really unlikely to find such a great combination of all features for such a great price  The car combines all out muscle with some nice features to be more practical  The ride comfort is not at the level of being a luxury car  not at all  it feels really distinctly like a sports car  but at the same time does not discomfort you while doing so  The car is a little annoying to get over speed bumps due to how low the car is  and there is the occasional squeak you ll hear when going over a bumpy road  but otherwise the sheer excitement of driving such a car will make you forget all of that  All of the extra comfort features are also very welcome in this sports car as well  Cold AC  power everything  cruise control  and hey  it even has a back seat for your friends  although not really big and roomy  is similar to the Integra I had before  so no big complaint there  If you can find one in good condition  don t hesitate to buy this car  Make sure to get it checked out at a mechanic s first because it has been 10 years  a lot can have happened to it  But if maintained well  this can give you years of excitement  and compliments b Update  11 17 02 b  Well  it s a bit more than 6 months since buying this car  so this is an update on my opinion on the car based on more experience  and I must say I will still back up everything I ve said and much much more  It has met all my expectations and more  First of all  I scrounged through the receipts from Steeda and I found that the previous owner had installed Steeda Sport Springs which effectively lower the car and the center of gravity  That would explain why I scrape the bottom of my car everytime I go over a speed bump  and I go REALLY slow too  Well since buying it I ve had to give the car a major tune up  replacing such parts as all the spark plugs  spark plug wires  distributor cap  water pump  serpentine belt  and the fan clutch  This might seem like a huge list of parts  but most of it besides the waterpump and fan clutch is part of the tune up and other preventive maintenance  The thing that really stands out is the costs  For my old car  the Acura Integra  a new distributor cap would have run as high as  150  On the Mustang  the brand new distributor cap was  20 and change  This was basically the case with everything else  To get the waterpump and serpentine belt replaced was less than  200 total including parts  labor  and tax  If I was to get either the drive belt or timing belt and the waterpump replaced in the Acura Integra I would have been looking at a good  500 or more job  So owning a popular American car has really saved me a lot of money  Cars like the Chevy Camaro and the Ford Mustang are so common and simple that there are a huge array of aftermarket retailers that deal in parts and upgrades for them  Thus  extremely low costs Also  I cannot really make mention of anything illegal such as street racing  so I ll have to say  I haven t been involved in any illegal street racing  However  you and I both know that when you own a Mustang  you re going to get challenged at the stop light  it s inevitable  by every rice boy in town  and eh hem  I can t say I ve officially raced them  but I can say  unofficially  that I ve NEVER yet  lost   hint   hint   So speed lovers out there  this is definitely one of the more rewarding cars to buy on the market
