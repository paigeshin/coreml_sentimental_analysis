 I bought my 1991 Ford Taurus L Wagon from a local used car lot in really good condition  It said 71 XXX on the five digit odometer so there was no telling how many miles was on it  I needed to have a car  and I always admired the Ford Taurus Wagons  I took it on a test drive  and fell in love with the handling and with some of the features  I purchased the car for  2 000 doing a  Buy here  Pay here  financing  Which I later paid it off early and only paid  1 800 for it  I took a trip the same day about 50 miles away from my home  On my way I ended up getting a speeding ticket for 80mph in a 65mph  I was actually so impressed with the handling and quality of ride  I was unaware that I was speeding  I was just watching the road  I made that trip  and back  and an extra couple of days on that full tank of gas  which impressed me for being a wagon  After a while I started noticing the  flaws  in it  I started having problems with the transmission  it started lacking Horsepower  and the AC started getting warm  The rear wiper motor and rear defroster stopped working  I ended up re charging the AC retrofitted  and replacing the thermostat  water pump  radiator  the original one cracked and exploded  could have caused serious injury  both front motor mounts  and a battery  Though we replaced a lot of stuff  we live in the mountains in NC and put about 20 000 miles a year on it  and I was very impressed with how this 10 year old car took the stresses of everyday climbing hills and pulling a lot of weight with its front wheel drive  I sold this wagon to get a 92 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser  Check out that review later
