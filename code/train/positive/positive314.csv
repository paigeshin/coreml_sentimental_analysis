 I live in the Netherlands Europe and bought a new Ford Windstar SEL  which comes  unfortunately  with a 3 0 ltr engine in the Netherlands only  We  a family of 6  like to go on holidays on long trips like driving to Spain or Southern France  occasionally with a trailer caravan When I was in a hurry to get home I drove about 1000 miles from Spain to Netherlands in a consecutive night and day  with hardly a pause Under such circumstances you really value the Windstar as a family limo  5 people are just sleeping and I am driving  with comfortable seating  music on a headphone   fan to keep you awake  and the small inside rearview mirror to watch over your family  in the meantime dragging a fully loaded caravan mobilehome through the rolling hills I have driven Mercedes  Volvo  Audi  Buick and other good cars  but like this one most cause driving it doesn t tire you The only thing I don t like is that models exist with a bigger engine and I don t have it  even at a gasoline price of 5 dollar a gallon and that car probably costing as much as   50 000 over here If Ford starts to export 3 8 ltr models to Europe  that will probably be my next one  next year or so One other thing is the remote sensor  In European cities you don t have much parking space  but with this reverse sensor  you can park it anywhere with great pleasure and people watching and admiring you for your craftmanship Of course this car also had minor drawbacks sofar  like electric side doors not closing without some help every once in a year and plastic details just falling of but hey nothing is perfect and a Ford isn t a Ford with some less significant loose parts easy to be clicked back  Auto Detroit is French for selfdestruct Also the seat configuration is hard to change  with some European cars like Renault or Opel you need only to point to a seat to remove but in Windstar it is real work One more important positive part  my wife doesn t like to drive big cars in general  but really loves this one
