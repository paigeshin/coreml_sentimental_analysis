 I am not going to write about stats and specs for this SUV  That is mostly available in car magazines  and many other websites First impressions 1  From the outside  it looks larger and  meaner  than a comparably priced Toyota Rav4 or Honda CRV  It looks tough and durable and not quite as  cute  as other comparable mini SUVs 2  The two tone body color takes a little getting used to  I liked the silver color  so it blends a bit better with the black 3  I really like the factory alloy wheels  It looks sporty  rugged  and classy at the same time 4  The front looks ready for off road  similar to an Explorer The interior 1  Very nice  The leather is comfortable and I was impressed with number of features it offers for the price  It has power front seats  large moonroof  very roomy for a small SUV  and the gauges are nicely located and very easy to read  2  The Mach Audio system is probably one of the best factory sound system I have listened to  It comes with 6 disc changer  and 7 speakers  3  The controls seem to plain such as the AC controls  vents  etc  Also  one complaint I have was it has no air vents for the rear seats  The drive 1  It was a bit on the loud and rough side 2  Acceleration is car like but I was hoping it would be faster since it is after all  a 201 hp V6 carrying a fairly light load  I have driven the 4Runner  which has less power and heavier  but seems to accelerate just as fast  I suppose the powerband of the Ford s Duratec V6 is geared towards more on the upper RPMs  3  With its independent suspension  the Escape handles like a car and show no hint of tilt or body roll on a fairly fast 90 degree turn 4  The power brakes are good but does not have the car like stopping power This SUV provides an overall good balance in terms of 1  Price 2  Features 3  Performance And one last thing  this SUV does not cost too much to insure
