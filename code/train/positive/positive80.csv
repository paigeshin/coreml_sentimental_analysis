 This is a Vehicle to Love  I bought a 2000 Ford F 150 its terrific it has 4 doors  all the luxury s of a car rides wonderful it has a cd player power windows  abs brakes on all 4 wheels  The cost was  24 000 00 was like a steal  While theres no four wheel drive on this vehicle they do make them I didn t want 4 wheel drive nor did i want a V 8 this truck is a V 6 and still moves great  I had a Dodge Ram before this and it rode just like a truck on the freeways it made me sick to ride in it  so if you want a truck with all the luxury s of a car and the ride of a car this is the truck for you  They are priced well and look great and run terrific  This truck has lots of room for a truck it fits 5 adults comfortably br br
