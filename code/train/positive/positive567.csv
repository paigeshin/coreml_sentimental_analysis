 Ever since high school I ve wanted to own a Mustang GT  I bought it two years ago with about every option imaginable and have been very happy with it overall It is a true sports car which means it was designed to drive fast and handle like a sports car not a cadillac  It s a lot of fun to drive  The seats are somewhat uncomfortable especially for long trips  If you have a bad back this is not a good every day choice for you The 4 6liter V8 packs a pretty good punch  225 horsepower is decent  not quite as fast as the Z28 of the same year but much better looking A few pet peeves the cup holders are ridiculous  there is one huge one which if you put a drink in there   it inevitably falls out on the floor and one smaller one which if you put your drink in it  you can t shift into second or fourth because it s blocked by your drink  don t Ford engineers drive these cars themselves the head rest is set so far back that it might as well not be there at all sunroof was not an option  I had to install myself for an extra 1 000 br br
