 I love my Bronco  I think it has been the best running vehicle I have ever owned  I bought it because it was such a good deal  that I just couldn t pass it up  I ve wanted one because they looked roomy  One day I was out running around and saw it  at such a low price  I just had to have it  So I took it out for a test drive and it handled so well I took it to have my dad look at it  he went with me driving around  We took it back to the lot and filled out the paper work  I got to take it that night  I drove around for hours  I knew I that I didn t go wrong  I just love to go driving around because it runs like a dream  is real smooth  I like this vehicle so much  if I was to win the lottery  my whole family would own one  If you want to enjoy your ride to the store or just anywhere this is the vehicle for you  There is plenty of space to put a stroller  groceries  and the kids too  People who can t judge distance of your cars should not own this vehicle  because you are pretty high up and the front looks pretty wide  If you ask me  you should own one br br
