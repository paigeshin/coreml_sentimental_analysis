 I purchased a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3  S2 model  not too long ago and I absolutely love it  I couldn t ask for a better vehicle  I previously owned a 1999 Mercury Cougar  It was a great car until it started having problems  I haven t had a single problem with the ZX3 yet  Ford really did a great job designing the Focus  It has a sporty yet sophisticated look to it  The model I bought had a MSRP of  16420  This included everything that I wanted  convenience group  power group  and S2 group  which I greatly recommend for  600  The S2 group includes premium 16  wheels and 50 series tires  premium gauges  S2 diamond pattern seats  6 disk in dash cd changer  bucket seats  rear spoiler  chrome exhaust tip  European tuned suspension  and everything that the sports group offers  Not a bad deal for  600  The other groups included power everything and such amenities as A C  keyless entry  tilt and telescoping steering wheel  cruise control  etc  As you can tell  it is a lot for the money  There is no other car that offers this much at a reasonable price  The driving experience is excellent  I opted for the 5 speed manual transmission in my ZX3 although an 4 speed auto is optional  The ride is exceptionally smooth for a small car due to its 4 wheel independent suspension  Even when cruising in the highway at 70 mph the wind and road noise is minimal  Inside the car the controls are nicely layed out and within perfect reach  Headroom in the car is abundant even for someone over 6  tall  The seats provide great support and room  even with 5 adults in the car  The rear hatch provides enough room for storage  but with the split rear seats folded down the is a whoping 18 5 cubic feet of space  That s enormous for a hatchback  The only thing that Ford could do to improve the car is have a more powerful engine offered  Perhaps a 2 5 liter  The 2002 SVT model will remedy this but is going to carry a more expensive price tag at  18 500
