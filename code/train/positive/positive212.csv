 We own a 1998 Contour SE equipped with the 24 valve V 6  The car was built in October 1997 and we have put 30 000 miles on it since we bought it new We compared the Contour to the Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima but found those models a little out of reach for our budget  We also drove the Dodge Stratus  Pontiac Grand Am  Ford Taurus  Mazda 626 and the Nissan Altima  Although those models were similarly priced  we did not feel that they could match the Contour in drive quality  performance  interior ergonomics and exterior styling  We purchased the Contour knowing that for less than  17 000 we were getting an attractive American car with the features we wanted  We made the decision that while the Accord or Maxima might have better build quality and lasting resale value we could not justify the  3000 to  5000 premium The car drives like a more expensive sports sedan  The smooth V 6 has a lot of power to offer at any speed and the suspension is tuned to give the driver a lot of confidence  The ride quality suffers as a result  but we knew it would  We do wish the car had more interior room  especially in the back seat  Do not plan on taking long trips with adults in the rear seats  After 3 years we still have things to like about the car  but there are some things that must be considered if you are looking at buying one  We have gotten used to the ample power the V6 provides and the sporty handling  in addition  we still find it to be one of the more attractive cars in its class There have been numerous malfunctions that have required dealer service  Ford has issued 5 recalls for this model for different reasons  The check engine light came on  but that is a common problem on all cars with current emission control systems  The fuel filler tube to the gas tank inexplicably became constricted to the point that it took 10 minutes to fill the tank  The most troublesome thing we have experienced is that there are pieces of trim that cover the jack points below the doors that will not stay on  We have noticed that there are a lot of Contours on the road with the same problem  They cost roughly  15 each  All of the other problems were covered under warranty As annoying as any trouble with a new car is  we have taken it in stride  We still feel that the car was a good buy and plan to keep it until it has about 75 000 miles on it  You might not want to consider this car if you plan to put fewer miles on it than that because the residual value on Contours is not good  On the other hand  if you can find a low mileage used one you might save yourself some money Overall  I would say that we are happy with our decision based on the choices we had at the time  There might be a better model today  but put the Contour on your list and at least give it a test drive br br
