 I love it  My truck has a great look and definitely turns heads  I trade in a 95 Ford Explorer Sport 4x4  I have to tell you that I already miss the full back seat My two daughters like riding in the back but I can tell the novelty will soon wear off  The Explorer had more power and the turning radius was much better  however at 83000 miles the gas mileage was horrible I went to the Dealership with the intention of buying a new Ford Explorer  however  the 30  sticker sent me looking for something cheaper  I looked at the new Sport and Sport Track but like it s big sister the price with options put it near 30k  Too much for a car in my opinion  I immediatly noticed the truck on the showroom floor  It looked very tough and extremely Sporty  Be advised I am a 36 yo white collar professional not an 18 yo looking to buy his first truck The salesman was steering me toward the new Escape yuk  The Escape is boring inside and out  I kept going back to the Ranger  After a long solo test drive I was sold  The wind noise is average  The Nissan I test drove was much worse  Take offs from traffic lights are more than adequate  The internal controls are easy to reach and attractive  I opted for the 6 disc in dash CD player  It reacts a little to slow for my taste but the sound is clear it makes highway driving fun  I play music loud and cannot hear anything going on outside the truck  I especially like the way Ford increased the Ranger s height  It sits at the same level as the Explorer Overall I recommend the Ranger Extended Cab 4x4 4 0 V6  It handles well and does great off road  The stylish improvements and interior do a great justice to this Truck  If you are in the market for a small SUV or pick up try this out in your search  You will not be disappointed  It matched the foreign competition in every way except was typically 3 5000 thousand dollars cheaper  Good luck
