 I have a 1993 Ford Probe SE  It has approximately 88 000 miles on it  It is a five speed  The car has power windows  power door locks  power sunroof  and power seats  These are very luxurious and make the car very enjoyable to drive  I have the low profile tires for it which are standard on the SE  The probe has an equalizer to compliment the stereo which has a tape player  I am going to get a cd player for it soon  The color is blue green and the inside is black and gray  The car looks very sleek and very sporty  I enjoy driving it every time  The car is quick and handles very well  It has an driver s side air bag and anti lock brakes which are nice to have  On the highway the car is very smooth and quiet  You can barely hear the engine running  The one thing I do not like is that once in a while there is a little rattle inside the dashboard which is common for probes  When I am driving it I definetly feel like I am driving a sports car  If I didn t know it I would think I was driving a Porshe  Everyone on the road checks out the car because of it looks and style  The sunroof is nice to have in the summer just having the air rush in over you  The people who should buy this vehicle are people who love speed  sporty cars  and quickness  There are plenty of saftey features on car so parents will like it for their children  Anyone who wants a big slow car shouldn t buy it br br
