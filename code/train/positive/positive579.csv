 The ford explorer is a very tricky car  when i first bought it  it was as if it was a dream  it drives like no other  and its very comfortable  but after a few months of driving  it began breaking down  and loosing parts very fast  not only did it stall all the time  and had to change light bulbs  batteries etc  the cost became very great  since i was having to fix it all the time  it got expensive  the parts where also expensive  the car is a very safe car  but you cannot take corners fast  it topples over easily  it is a very top heavy car  it has room  and has a big engine  it handles nice in the snow  over all i give it a three out of five stars
