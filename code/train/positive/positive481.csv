 I own a 1993 Ford Thunderbird LX Automatic V 6  It has been the most reliable car I have ever owned  more reliable than any of several foreign cars  including a Saab  The car now has 186 000 miles on it  and I have replaced only one major part  the head gasket  That was a costly  1000  repair  but a faulty head gasket can be manufactured by any company  it s just bad luck  Aside from that  all other engine and drive train parts are original and functioning well One drawback is that the doors are long and heavy  and  therefore  difficult for small people to manage  Their own weight caused them to sag  and I had to have them repaired  but it was not terribly expensive  There have been about three call backs  but none of them were of concern to me  and I have not had the work done What sold me on the car was the test drive  The car holds corners extremely well  and the highway ride is that of a big luxury car  The visibility is good in all directions  I have had no trouble on wet roads  and the snow handling has been satisfactory I paid about  15 500 for the car in 1993  so the cost of about  2200 per year  or 8 cents a mile  has been very reasonable All in all  I would recommend this as a good used car  if it has been well maintained  The model is out of production now  Ford is planning to reintroduce the Thunderbird as a sports car br br
