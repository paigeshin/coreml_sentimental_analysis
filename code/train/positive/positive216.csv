 We bought a 1998 Ford Contour in 1997 and at first were so happy  It is a smaller car  but with 4 doors and a good sized trunk  it was roomy enough for our family of 3 at the time  Then slowly things started happening  First the air stopped working  then we would get things in the mail every few months or so about a recall on the car  Once it was the head lights  another time the breaks  and another time the air conditioner  The seat belts are constantly getting jammed and with 2 kids and a seat belt law  we need our seatbelts to work properly  Ford was always happy to fix these things as the car is still under warranty  but it is just bothersome to have to keep taking it in and being without a car for a few days at a time
