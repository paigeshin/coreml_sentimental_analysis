 This is just the first time Ford has decided to put a permanent camper shell on it  I love this vehicle  and I ve never set foot in one  but I have done my research  so bear with me through this Epinion This truck definitely offers its share of pros For starters  it is the biggest passenger vehicle you can own without requiring a commercial drivers license  At nineteen feet long and almost seven feet high  you can easily seat ten people and their luggage comfortably  Have something to tow  This vehicle will do it  Have a 10 000 lb boat  No problem  tow it up to the lake  Ford only produced a few of these vehicles this year  so you re guaranteed a limited edition  This gives you a nice interior  towing package among many other things  Where as many people agree this truck is too big  it does offer things to counter that  Such as oversize mirrors  reverse sensors optional  and drop down window sills that make it easier to see out of the sides  I ve heard that the sound system is quite exceptional in this vehicle  although I don t know the exact number of speakers or the setup  Ford has heard the cry from the compact car drivers  and they have run support bars that will keep the Excursion from decapitating your Metro  I ve heard people complain of parking in this vehicle  no matter how bad the steering is  you get used to it  and soon you won t even realize that you have to turn a bit more  watch a little better and swing wider than in the car  Safety is a big part of this vehicles selling point  Do you think anything short of a Semi could hurt you in this vehicle  Just remember to wear your seat belt Like all vehicles  the Excursion does have its share of cons I have heard it was built on the F 150 frame  F 250 frame  and F 350 frame  I can t seem to find the exact frame  I ve ruled out the F 150 frame  as that is what the Expedition is on  I don t think Ford would put their biggest vehicle on the mid sized frame  I m almost certain that the Excursion is on the F 350 frame  The F 350 pick up is not know for it s comfort  it is know for getting the job done and having plenty of room to do it  So  when you notice that you re feeling more of the bumps in the road than in a car  don t be surprised  this is the more rigid suspension  which helps you to be able to tow so much or load the back of the truck version with three tons of sand  At 3 5 tons of Excursion  don t expect to get good gas mileage  You ll get between 9 and 14 mpg  depending on driving conditions  This isn t that bad if you consider that you are carpooling with the best of them  With a fully loaded truck  each person is getting 10  so you pull off an amazing 100 mpg  tell that to the two person Honda getting 60 mpg  You also have a 44 gallon tank  so range won t be lacking  but bring the Visa to fill it up  Come on Ford  its the year 2000  When you purchase a 4x4 version of this vehicle  be prepared to climb out in the mud to lock the hubs to get it locked into four wheel drive  This vehicle is also not cheap  expect to pay  35 000 for a stripped version and up to  50 000 for the XLT One thing to look out for  Ford brags that the drive train is made to withstand up to 500 ft  lbs  of torque  The diesel version of the Excursion pushes 540 ft  lbs  of torque  you may experience transmission problems in the long run If you need one of these vehicles  I definitely recommend it  If you are planning on using it as your daily driver  I d think otherwise  it may be best to get a small car and this vehicle to be a little more economical Where as the Excursion does look like a very nice vehicle  I would recommend the Suburban over it any day  For starters  the Suburban comes with a 5 7 Liter V8 or a 7 4 L V8  With the 350 Cubic Inch engine  I ve heard of gas mileage approaching 18 mpg  You ll never have to lock the hubs on the Suburban  and you ll have Chevy dependability to look forward to On a final note  I think Nissan sums it up nicely with   quot Yeah  we made it bigger quot br br
