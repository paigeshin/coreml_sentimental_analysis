 I leased this vehicle for two years  It was the best vehicle I have ever owned leased  What I noticed the most was how well it handled  I was worried with such a large vehicle that it would be hard to control  It had a very smooth ride and the steering was so much better than the Explorer I had before  I loved the heating cooling contols in the back of the vehicle  The room was so nice for my family of 5 as no one had to be crowded while traveling  The four wheel drive switch on the dash was awesome  I loved not having a shifter on the floor  The vehicle I leased had running boards which made it nice to get in and out of in a dress  It had a console with the CD changer inside  I loved being able to have 6 CD s in at a time and the ability to change them easily  I am not much up on the details of the engine  all I know is that it ran great and never gave me any trouble in the two years I leased  I am seriously thinking of leasing another one when the lease on our truck expires br br
