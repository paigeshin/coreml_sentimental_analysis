 Late in the summer of 1999  my husband and daughter were in an accident that left our 1993 Chevrolet Lumina minivan totaled  We spent the next month searching for a replacement  When buying a new vehicle  my husband and I have different priorities  My concern is generally limited to the passenger area and comfort  while he is concerned about what is under the hood  We both have been very pleased with the minivan we chose  a 1999 Ford Windstar  After test driving many new and used minivans  the first thing I noticed when I got into the Windstar was how well built and sturdy it felt  It handled well  and was very comfortable  I liked how the instrument panel was designed   everything was easy to find  and clearly labeled  I was also impressed with the amount of space there was  both leg room and hauling space  The rear bench seat can be moved to the center  allowing even more space in back  I also noticed the arm rest by the window  A person in the front seat doesn t need the window down to rest their arm as if it were  Every seating position was comfortable  and the upholstery and door design were very pleasing to the eye  Having the second sliding door is something we wanted  as was keyless entry  No more fumbling for keys in the rain  The Windstar had everything we wanted  and two hours later it was ours  I realize that engine power and size are important  and my husband is very pleased with that aspect of our new van  Of course  safety played an important part of our decision  and the Windstar consistently ranks among the safest  If you want comfort along with reliability in a minivan  I highly recommend the Ford Windstar
