 Americans travelling in Europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a Mercedes E class or BMW 5 series pulls up to the curb  In America  these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation  In their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn In the late 80 s Ford tried to beat the Germans at their own game  In 1986 they had bet the company on the groundbreaking Taurus  If you weren t there  it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the American auto industry  Its styling was as cutting edge as any European sedan of the time and it had much more of a European feel than any American sedan made before  It couldn t compete against the European sedans sold here  But Ford wondered if the Germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan  could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle America That was the challenge that faced the Taurus SHO throughout its eleven year production run  It was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from BMW and Mercedes  one with a distinctive American accent  But in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this Taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their Fairmont or Caprice Classic for b Overview and Driving Impressions b There were three generations of the SHO  The first  1989 1991  was the original  86  quot Jellybean quot  Taurus platform with the SHO V 6 and suspension component upgrades  The final version  1996 1999  used the all new  quot Oval quot  Taurus platform and carried an equally new V 8  But I don t recommend either  The first generation SHO was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasn t intended for it  while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions  The sweet spot was the 1992 1995 second generation cars  In 1992 all Taurii were redesigned and the SHO received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper  stronger look than the first edition  Under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed  and the entire platform was strengthened  giving the SHO handling abilities that came closer to matching the Germans than any American sedan that came before  And in 1993 it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over American buyers The heart of the SHO was its engine  Yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 liter Ford V 6  The head they came up with produced too much power for the Ford block to live with  so Ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant  Their answer was a dual overhead cam  24 valve V 6 that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser Taurus models  The engine was a marvel  With 220 horsepower available the SHO was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging  But it weighed 400 pounds less than the Merc and 500 pounds less than the BMW  This made the Taurus SHO the quickest car in its class More important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action  The Mercedes  from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action  felt literally like a bank vault on wheels  The BMW reeked of refinement by drivers  extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure  Both were outstanding cars with clear personalities  But neither  in my book  compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the SHO  When you got into the gas in the Ford the engine growled  the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands  then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards 7 000 rpm  It wasn t crude  in capable hands the SHO was a remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses  The SHO was simply spicier and more engaging than the Germans One of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle  First gen SHO s used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses  Starting in  92 all five speed SHO s ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel  But it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive BMW with its superb five speed  All front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup  Torque steer  another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars  could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving  As I mentioned earlier  in 1993 the SHO got the slushbox  automatic  the critics said the market wanted  The thinking was  as only a relative few BMW s came to America with manual gearboxes and Mercedes didn t offer them on any model in the E class  to compete the SHO needed an automatic even if the purists had a fit over it  The critics were half right  The automatic didn t make the SHO a bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car  This is just my personal preference  but in a midsized or larger sedan I prefer an automatic if it is done right  Hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of life s greater joys  but a 3 000 pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought  And a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving  In the SHO it was no contest in my book  The automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual  Huh  While the manual was improved in  92  it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively  The automatic was better mated to the SHO  with crisp  smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car  and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual  Unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can t have any sports car with an automatic  the auto is a better way to go If the Taurus was a bargain BMW  as reviewers and fans called it  it hid the trimmed corners well  I don t know how Ford made a dime on them  I prepped new cars and did trim NVH repairs at a large Ford dealer in 92 94 and quickly noticed that a loaded out Taurus LX was only a couple of thousand dollars less than a SHO  Fully equipped  with leather  excellent power sport seats  full power accessories  power glass moonroof  premium  JBL  sound  CD and the automatic the sticker came in at less than  25 000  The E 320 and 530i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim  It s the greatest price disparity between similar cars that I ve ever seen b Reliability And Maintenance b Against all bets when it was in production  the second generation SHO has proven itself a remarkably durable car  Only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars  SHO s driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe  It s not a fatal problem  the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars  including labor  The front brakes are another consistent source of trouble  The second generation cars were slightly better but Ford simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan  The rotors get too hot and warp when used hard  and like most cars made in the last decade Ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once   Maybe  if you were lucky and caught it soon enough  Finally  for all the initial concern about funneling 200 lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle  the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models  The brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts  and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years  All in all  not a bad list of  quot major quot  problem areas for a high performance car   And by contrast  the second generation base Taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their 3 8 liter engines and eating their AXOD E transaxles The SHO models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable  Can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model One problem area that isn t unique to the SHO but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition  If the thermostat sticks open the engine won t overheat  but something just as bad can happen  All fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture  If the engine is running too cold  as it will when the thermostat is stuck open  the mixture will be too rich  But instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog  it is ignited and burned in the cat  Which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside  It s not a problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed  like when getting off the freeway  When you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the SHO are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine  It is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake  All four areas should be checked out before buying a SHO  The Yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite  Aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven t been any major problems with the engine at all   Look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup  hard starting  or oil consumption greater than a quart every 700 miles  Like most of their motorcycle engines  the SHO does not have hydraulic valve adjustors so the clearance has to be set by a mechanic  But unlike a bike it s not a regular occurrence  Ford specifies a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt  spark plug wires and control arm bushings  It is a major bill  but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go  and this service on the SHO will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a BMW or Mercedes as the miles reach this territory   One note  The SHO  like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine  should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year Other problems fall into the nitpick category  In looking through the newsgroup boards  I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones I saw when the cars were still under warranty  most involving interior trim parts  Is my relief confusing  While the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where Ford missed the mark in design and manufacture  after five to seven years I expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasn t been the case  The good news is  the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception  If you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism  a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat  It s not a safety hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor  But if you want to repair it plan on laying out about  300 for a new power mechanism   Pricing and Owner Support b The discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the SHO has been another pleasant surprise  There are regional SHO owner clubs across America and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts   Note to gearheads  The level of aftermarket support for the V 6 SHO is as good as you ll find for a Camaro or Mustang  At extremely affordable prices for this class  too  Along with continued parts support from Ford  the SHO is one of the rare limited edition models that hasn t become an orphan in retirement  But it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market  The Kelly Blue Book quotes a  10 200 retail price for a  95 SHO automatic with 75 000 miles in my area  Like when it was new that is almost exactly half the Blue Book for a 530i or E 320  But in my area that would buy you an immaculate car  In the last year I ve seen close to a dozen very clean 92 95 SHO s with prices in the  7 000 range  And because most SHO buyers weren t testosterone poisoned young adults  read Camaro Mustang market  the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good b Conclusion b A SHO has been on my list of cars to have since I worked on them at Earnhardt Ford  It s a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well  and the Mad Scientist in me still gets an evil grin when I think about the things I wanted to do with it   And that was when I only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick 60 70 pounds just on the interior  Now I can get superchargers that make up to  400 horsepower i  Bottom line  As an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what Ford created  or as the platform for a midlife crisis  the SHO is impossible to beat  It was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new  and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts  And if a Bimmer owner scoffs  as they are wont to do  just ask how he likes his taxi    Brian Igo  i The source for everything you ever wanted to know about the SHO  and one of the best auto fan sites I ve seen on the web  is  SHOtimes com   This is an indispensable resource for SHO owners  All of the DIY cheap fixes I mentioned in passing are there  along with an excellent reference on troubleshooting literally dozens of different conditions and great how to instructions for maintenance This may be hazardous to your wealth  but  SHOShop com  is a wonderful and highly recommended source for replacement and aftermarket SHO parts  Excellent stuff at reasonable prices  and the best designed website I ve seen for a speedshop i br br
