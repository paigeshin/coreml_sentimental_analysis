 Dear S U V  shoppers  Your reading my review on this vehicle in hopes I can tell you all about the Ford Expedition  Well  your in a lot of luck because I have recently purchased one  This vehicle is a big thing on comfort  It used to be that if you sat in the back seat you were very uncomfortable  but in this vehicle the back seats are just as comfortable as the front  Not only that  but as well as holding 8 passengers when the THIRD row is set up this vehicle can tow a trailer behind it  For all you who show horses  and have a big family  you no longer have to rely on a pick up to get the job done  This means no more taking two vehicles and wasting money on gas  As for you who can t seem to stay away from the lake you can pull that nice boat behind you oh yeah  and don t forget all of your fishing buddies  When we first got our shiny new Expedition everyone wanted to ride in it  One of the options we decided on was a six C D  changer  Now there was no more reloading discs every time you wanted some new tunes  This came in as a nice option for the people in the back  for they could listen to the radio on headphones in the back when grandma up front wanted to listen to Jazz  no offense to jazz  I love it  but some people don t  Another thumbs up for the rear seat passengers are the separate heating and air conditioning controls for them  If they got could there was no more yelling at the driver to  quot Turn the heat up quot   I think we all know how annoying that gets  That means comfort for the drivers ears  and no more headaches  either  Well  to sum it all up  which is pretty hard to do  With everything this special S U V  comes with there s too much to say  Now there s only one problem  who gets to drive br br
