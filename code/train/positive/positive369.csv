 When I was first on the market for an SUV  I was really looking for the Ford Explorer  A friend of mine has one and I absolutely loved driving it  It was a great truck  however  I couldn t find any decent  inexpensive  Explorers and I settled for a Jeep Grand Cherokee  This was a huge mistake After having the Jeep for about three months  I was in an accident  I was coming home from work when someone slammed into my passenger side  the car buckled and was ripped apart  Not only was I extremely shaken up  but I was also on the prowl for a new car Thankfully my insurance company is very understanding  and was extremely quick with my claim  I again set out looking for an Explorer  however when I got to the dealership  I found that love at first sight does exist When I saw the Maroon Ford Expedition  I was in love  This car is amazing  I know many people who look at it see only a massive road hogging beast  however the Ford Expedition is one of the most stylish  sleek  sporty SUVs in my opinion  However  don t get me wrong  my Expedition definitely has that rugged edge Driving an Expedition is something that everyone has got to get used to  Even if you have driven an SUV before the Expedition is rather large  it takes some time to get used to  Judging the distance from cars on your side and front is the most frustrating at times  but after a few drives  everything falls nicely into place Once you ve mastered driving  you get the uneasy task of learning to park the beast  My first tip  Stay away from parking garages until you are confident in your parking techniques  Parking in a parking garage is generally awkward  however when you ad the size of the Expedition  it gets even harder  Not to mention the fact that  and it never fails  the first time you drive into the garage you will worry that your car won t fit If you live in a city  be forewarned parallel parking is rough  It is hard to find spaces to fit the car into  but don t stress it too much  because although rare they are there  With a mastery of driving and parking  the car is perfect  The seats are remarkably comfortable and the car is extremely roomy The only part of the car that there is little to no headroom is the third seat in the  way back  The third seat is slightly raised and because of that you lose a little bit of headroom  and if you are a taller person you lose all of your headroom  Also  because the seat is raised  you don t have a place to put you legs  For my unfortunate friends in the  way back  I apologize  next time you ll remember to call shotgun won t you A few of the features that make the car even more comfortable  are the heating and radio features  First  my radio is a grade  A  CD Tape player  with a six disc changer for the CD player  The speaker system is very good  and although many people will add a specialized stereo system to their cars  the factory works fine for me Not only is the radio a great quality  but it has two sets of controls  The main console is in the dash board  however in the back seat  there is a separate console with a head phone jack for the people in the back to set their own stations according to their musical tastes  This feature is also found in the heating system  Both the front and the backseat have climate controls  to set the temperature for both portions of the car If you are looking for a massive car that handles amazingly well  I d recommend that you at least test drive a Ford Expedition  The car is great  and it is one of the most comfortable rides I ve ever had
