 I ve had my 91 Ford Probe LX for 2 years  now  Overall  it is quite an excellent car  and will probably drive you to the end of the earth  It has the first generation Probe body style  which in my opinion looks better and much sportier than the second generation body  I bought mine with 145000 miles on it  and the major problem I had with it was the cooling system  I had to replace the radiator  heat sensing unit  themostat  and coolant tubes  This is very important to check out  because if one of those coolant tubes break  you re not going anywhere  Though this is important to check out on any used car  it s especially important on this model of Probe  After I had that fixed  I have had absolutely no problems with the Probe  It s a very reliable car  always starts in the winter  and has taken me on quite a few long interstate trips  I ve seen some of these things with 250000  miles on them  The LX is one of the few models to have a 3 0 V 6 engine  Stomp on the gas and it goes when it has to  These cars were originally built for rally races  which means on the automatic transmission  there is a manual downshifting button  If used correctly you can outrun a Mustang  but don t count on beating higher level models  The car drives quite comfortable and smoothly  although the suspensions pretty tight  so you can feel bumps in the road  It s pretty nimble too  and if you re good you can drive yourself out of a bad situation with ease  This thing has breaks from hell  it can stop on a dime  and work the brakes pretty hard too  Gas mileage is pretty decent for a V 6  and has all kinds of computer controlled engine efficiency systems  It has electric windows  and defogger which are quite nice  The front is roomy  the back however is for midgets  and the trunk is bigger than you would expect  Once you make sure everything is is running order  it ll last a long time br br
