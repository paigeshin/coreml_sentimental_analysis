 The Ford Mustang has really made a great car with there new convertible and witht the hard top  The Car has plenty of power along with a great design that will turn heads everywhere  One of the best parts about the car is that it has a roomy enough seat to have an average sized adult sit back there  especially when the top is down  It is a little cramped  but much better than most other convertibles  It has an electric top which makes it easy to get out in the sun with just a push of a button  The car has plenty of power to get the wheels spinning  and you won t need to bring extra fuel tanks  it does pretty well on gas mileage  One of the down sides to the car  is that it looks as if the outer molding is very much like thinplastic  and woul probably break in an accident  However  it still looks really great  and for kids   or adults that act like kids  it is a great car br br
