 We were fed up with the cost of repairing our old camper van so we set out to lease a truck  The  99 F 150 series appealed to us with a solid build  reasonable cost  and great looks  We got our new truck off the lot and within the first 14 days the transmission blew  Apparently  someone hadn t installed a part properly  The warning lights came on first but the handbook did not direct us to stop driving   just recommended to get it in for servicing We ve had more trouble since  with those warning lights coming on without any other symptoms attached  The good news   we only have to keep the truck for three years and the problems are under warranty  The bad news   this truck spends as much time in the shop as our 20 year old camper van   it s hard to go camping when it breaks down  VERY DISAPPOINTING br br
