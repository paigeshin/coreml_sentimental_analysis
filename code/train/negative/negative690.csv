 I bought a 1994 Probe GT with only 400 miles on it for  22 000  I took very good care of my car  servicing it often  Therefore  I was quite surprised when I had to have my engine rebuilt at 22 000 miles due to a defect in the oil system  Since that time  I have experienced numerous mechanical problems  including the same one that caused my engine to need rebuilding  Not only is the Probe a completely unreliable car  but the cost of maintenance is insane  Within the past three months  my car has needed more than  3 500 worth of work  just for the compressor  yes  the a c has gone out  a water pump  and an O2 sensor  There is a reason that Ford discontinued it s Probes  and that s because they are all poorly manufactured pieces of junk  I will say that it has excellent pickup  handles tightly  also in rain  is quite safe  and fun to drive   when it is running  However  after this experience  I will never buy another Ford again br br
