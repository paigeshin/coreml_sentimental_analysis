 When we bought this car we did not want to spend a lot of money  Ours was the last of its kind on the lot  it s a  97 G  but we bought it new in  98  It s stripped down  it has an AM FM stereo and power windows  but no power locks or trunk release from inside the vehicle   a definite negative  Still  these issues were minor because we wanted a car with a good safety rating  and we needed a car that was relatively inexpensive  This car was both We felt we were OK because it was new and came with the manufacturer s warranty 3 year  36 000 bumper to bumper  We used the car primarily for cross country trips and it did quite well  But on our third trip  we noticed the transmission was very tough to shift into gear  We had 8 000 miles on the car  The dealer found that the transmission had a problem  and only fixed the portion that was causing the problem  Some seals were bad  as well as some valves  I asked why they wouldn t replace the entire transmission  considering it failed after only 8 000 miles  He said they only repair the portions that failed  In my opinion  I have a defective transmission which is begging to fail and strand me  or my wife and kids  in the middle of nowhere  Ford was not willing to replace the transmission  Despite this major flaw  the transmission is still not working perfectly and the warranty has expired  the car has been fairly reliable  During the three years we ve owned it  we ve barely put 35 000 miles on it  All of the repairs done were covered by the warranty  see below  I won t say it was  free  however  because each time I took the car in for repairs  they kept the car all day and I had to make other arrangements to get to work  1  transmission   pseudo repaired   it works  but not perfectly 2  power steering pump   noisy and replaced 3  emissions switch   a light came on in the dash informing us to check the engine  had to go to a dealer  we were on vacation  and spent the morning there while the switch was replaced 4  weather stripping on passenger front door   seal was broken between the door and the car body   replaced
