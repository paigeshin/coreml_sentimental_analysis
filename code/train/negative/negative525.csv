 Having driven Ford Taurus  frequently from rental companies over the years  I have come to a love hate relationship  Now I have one of my own and nothing has changed This Taurus was not my choice   it is a company car which I use 100  of the time  for both business and personal use  Ford is slowly improving the style  particularly phasing out the oval shape of just about everything  The elimination of the oval shaped back window and the hardening of some of the exterior flow lines towards the rear of the car have helped its looks greatly This Taurus has a fairly smooth ride and a good grip on the road  Steering control is fairly tight Steering range is another story  I have never before had to back up and try again to navigate tight spots as much as I have to with this car  You get used to how far a wheel should turn on most cars   this doesn t even come close Inside  they have made attempts at comfort  though they miss the mark  The power driver s seat option is great and adjusts well  Having that also allows you to get the optional adjustable pedals  I love it  You will never again have leg cramps on long trips or find yourself adjusting your legs because the pedals are too far away or to close  This is particularly helpful for someone under about 5 7 Even with this comfort  your ride will be uncomfortable because the seats are cheaply done  They have little contour or padding to them  For someone who spends a lot of time in a car I would think twice here  The sun visors are cheaply done as well  They feel like painted cardboard  and are just about as thick  No luxuries like illuminated mirrors or extension for side facing sun  The interior is roomy  however  If you opt for the six passenger seating you will even find the middle seat up front to have good leg room One poor design is the armrest center console on the six passenger seating  Folded up for the sixth passenger everything is fine   except that there are no cup holders available to you  You can then unfold and open the armrest to expose the cupholders and the console storage area  while a second piece becomes the armrest  The major problem here is that there is no cover to the storage area  Anything you keep here   including coins in the coin holder   is in plain sight until you again fold everything up   leaving you with no cup holders again The CD player and stereo seem to work well  although CD and a cassette combination are not available  It also has a theft  remote lock and entry system So far  nothing has changed   I still have that love hate relationship with the Taurus
