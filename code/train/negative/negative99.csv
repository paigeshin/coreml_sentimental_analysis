 I bought my 93 Ford Probe GT used in 1998 from a Jeep dealer  STUPID  I test drove the car and liked it because of the way it looked   it was sporty and fun to drive  It only had 48 000 miles on it  with a purchase price of  9 995  which I now know was about  9 900 too much  When we bought the car  there was a couple of cosmetic things that needed fixed  i e  passenger side door panel falling off  etc  These were fixed within a few weeks  About 6 months into our ownership  some other not so cosmetic problems started happening   brakes grinding loudly  muffler not muffling  normal wear and tear  but things that should have been checked before the dealership sold the car  We took the car in and 2 days later  these simple things were fixed In October of 1999  approx  18 months after purchase  came the motherlode  The Probe overheated one morning when I got to work  I shut the car off and fluids started draining from what seemed like everywhere under the hood  The dealer I bought the car from came to my location and picked up the car  After they looked at it  they assessed that the water pump had gone out  the oil pan gasket was leaking and it basically needed a valve job  Thank GOD for extended warranty  I was without my car for approximately 1 1 2 weeks  Total cost for that job was around  1500  Then when I got the car back  the  quot Check Engine quot  light was on  I called the dealership back and asked why the light was now coming on  when it was not before  They looked at the car again  and found  they thought  that the Mass Airflow Sensor was bad  226  They replaced it  but it did not fix the problem  Then they thought the O2 sensor was bad  another  200 some    replaced it  to no avail  Finally they told me after another week  that they thought the EGR valve had gone bad  but that it would not be covered under warranty  310 for the part alone  I explained to them that even though they considered this a  quot wear and tear quot  part  I should not have to pay for it  We went back and forth  I took the car back and drove it  engine light flashing in my face and all  until I contacted the Better Business Bureau and a local television station  The dealership finally agreed to do the replacement I scheduled my appointment and took the car in  It took them about 3 days to get the part  When they replaced the EGR valve  guess what    it did not fix the problem  Surprise  surprise  So  they cleaned some vacuum lines  etc  still could not find the problem After about a week in the shop  they decided to send it to the Ford dealer down the street and let them look at it  Two and a half weeks later  I get my car back  but only after they put the car on their computer  it told them a part to replace  they replaced it and it didn t fix the problem  Ultimately  I think  it turned out to be a problem with a vacuum pump  or something Now  8 months later  yet another seemingly  quot impossible to figure out quot  problem has surfaced  On July 1  2000  my car quit running  unexplainably  Three different repair shops have looked over the car  trying to determine if it is an electrical problem  which I now understand these cars are notorious for having  or a fuel problem  No one can seem to figure it out  So now  I m back to the Ford dealer on Monday   I wonder if they can pinpoint the problem  I don t have a whole lot of faith I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone  unless you have money to just throw away  and a backup car to drive about every 6 months  for about a month at a time  and if you are just looking for a headache br br
