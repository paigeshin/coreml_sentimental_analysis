 PLEASE DO NOT BUY A WINDSTAR There are LARGE NUMBERS of owners experiencing mechanical problems with the Ford s 3 8L head gasket engine  including Sable Taurus  etc  You are welcome to read my earlier Windstar review on June 8  2000  In addition to the computer  brakes and head gasket  the Ford Windstar transmission is being mentioned more frequently on the Net as a problem area  I bought a 1995 Windstar new and like the roominess  comfort and safety rating  HOWEVER  the Honda Odyssey Toyota Sienna is just as safe  slightly smaller  more quiet inside  and MUCH MORE RELIABLE  Please do not take my word for it  simply go to the Net and read the information yourself BEFORE buying a Windstar  Start with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administrations consumer complaints  http www nhtsa dot gov cars problems complain Others include http home att net 7Eccatanese ford Fordmanx htm and http www lemonaidcars com home htm and http home att net 7Eccatanese ford mainx htm Please read these Windstar horror stories BEFORE you purchase one  Also  I request that you spread the word to family and friends ASAP as to the location of these websites  My Ford dealer refused to provide the name or number of the District Service Rep  Next I tried the Ford Consumer Help line waste of time and totally useless since they are not empowered to offer financial assistance  only the District Service Rep can do that Welcome to Ford s Catch 22
