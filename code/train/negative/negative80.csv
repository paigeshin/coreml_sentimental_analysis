 When my friends started to find out I was driving an expedition they all called me big  quot pimpin quot  Shawn  Cause The big SUV s are supposedly  quot pimpin quot  cars  Well when you look at them  yeah they are very nice in a monsterous way  They are hogs of the road  They need one of those signs on it that says oversized load  I don t like driving it cause its just too big  I always park it as far away from the other cars at parking lots cause I m afraid I might not be able to get out of the car  or worse yet not able to back it out of the parking spot  The worst part of the car is it s amazing ineffeciency with gas  I end up never useing the air conditioner  because the amount of money I m spending on gas is just so ludicrous  And it is taking it s toll on me  I live in southern California where the temperatures are soaring into unbearable levels  I can t complain about the amount of space the car has  It is very roomy  and you can fit like 7 people in it comfortably  This is defenitly a plus when your the designated driver at a pary or something of importance like that  If you have no need for the very large amount of space this car has  DO NOT PURCHASE IT  however if you have to move around a bunch of kids every day  or you need a very large carpool  THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU
