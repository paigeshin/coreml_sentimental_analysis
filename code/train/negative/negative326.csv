 This is an update from a review I previously done almost two years ago  First my wife and I test drove several of the competitors at the time before we decided on the Ford Windstar SEL  Because I had a friend who was a Fleet Manager at one of the Ford dealerships  I was able to purchase this vehicle for thousands of dollars less  Which was a good thing because as time went on  I would have to use the money I saved to the repairs that were needed to be done after the warranty expired  Here is my evaluation in several areas of the vehicle Handling  It is very similar to all the competitors out there  My van had the upgraded suspension and 16  alloy wheels  Going through turns at speed elicits some body roll but that is to be expected for a tall vehicle  Turning radius could be better  Both Toyota and Honda bests the Ford in this measurement  The power steering in this vehicle is somewhat too boosted for my taste which means numb road feel  I have the sense of being detached from the road  The suspension absorbs large and small bumps very well to the point of almost feeling like being in a large cruise ship  0 60 in this mini van is approximately 9 5 seconds  making it one of the fastest minivans available  Much of the credit for the handling can be derived from the use of the Windstar platform actually using the Taurus platform  Comfort  You could almost live in the Captain s chairs that are standard in this vehicle  It even has power lumbar supports for both front seats  The only thing missing is memory seating  Seven people definitely can fit in this vehicle more comfortably than the Toyota but is about the same in the Honda  Long trips in any of the seats will not elicit lower back pains  Freeway driving elicits 71dB on my sound level meter  For comparison  the Toyota and the Honda both registered 70dB  Wind noise is subdued  only engine noises when revved is somewhat loud  Even today  the mini van doesn t emit any squeaks or rattles  Interior Features  Power seats for both driver and passenger seats with power lumbar supports  Leather seating  AM FM Stereo Cassette with CD  On Board Diagnostic Computer with outside temperature and compass  power mirrors  power windows  keyless entry with remote open closing of sliding doors  This was the first year Ford introduced an additional sliding door on the driver s side  Auto headlight feature  interior child light  fake wood trim  tinted windows  Separate A C and heating compressors for the front and rear passengers  baby view mirror  garage door  coin and cupholders  security alarm and auto anti glare rearview mirror  At the time  Honda s mini van did not offer leather seating unless you went to an aftermarket place to have it done  Ingress Egress  The only weakness here is that the second row Captain s chairs are not moveable to one side  They move up similar to cars that only have two doors  If you are like me and have two kids in car seats and they take up the second row  it is difficult for adults to enter the third row to sit  You may want to choose the second row as a bench seat so that passengers will have room to sit in the third row more easily  Getting in the driver s seat or front passenger seat is very easy because of the large doors and low step in height which is similar to most large passenger automobiles  Drivetrain  This is the mini van s weakness  It is a four speed automatic with overdrive that you can defeat for those long uphill climbs so that the transmission will not have to hunt for the right gear to use  The transmission is smooth when it is working properly  The problem I experienced with the transmission was at 29 511 miles into the use of the mini van  I had to rebuild the transmission  Yes  I had to have the transmission rebuilt  Of course this expensive repair at  1200 happened when my original factory warranty ended  The dealership denied my claim for warranty service even though the original factory warranty was 36 months 36 000 miles  My transmission failure happened at the 40th month of ownership  I also found out later  I was one of three 1999 Windstars that the local transmission shop was working on for the same problem  The problem is that Ford uses low quality materials to produce their transmissions and the replacement parts of course are of a high quality material  When I saw the pinion gears  they looked like they had over 100 000 miles of wear on them  A design problem that contributed to this is that the transmission is from the Ford Taurus  A transmission designed for a vehicle that weighs 800 lbs  less than the Windstar Reliability  Here is what I had to have worked on since the 3 5 years of ownership  Four times I had to have the power sliding doors repaired because they always popped back open during a hot day  Even today  it still happens from time to time  One time I had to have the cable that closes the driver s side power sliding door be replaced because the cable actually broke  As I said in detail above in the drivetrain section  I had to have the transmission rebuilt  Recently  I had to have the driver s door handle plus internal mechanism replaced because Ford uses plastic parts for this high use area to ensure replacement  Economy  Gas mileage in this vehicle is on par with other mini vans  The EPA rating of 19 city and 23 highway is right on target  Luckily this mini van uses regular unleaded unlike the Honda and Toyota which recommend premium  Gas tank size is a very large 26 gallons for a great cruising range  Insuring this vehicle is similar to all of its competitors  fairly inexpensive Safety  This vehicle has anti lock brakes  front and side air bags  a five star crash rating all around  It was one of the first minivans to obtain this safety rating  Now it s newest competitors from Honda  Toyota and Mazda have the same five star safety ratings  Summary  This mini van can compete easily with its competitors on drivability  handling  comfort and interior features but unfortunately has a poor reliability experience for me  I am very hesitate to recommend this vehicle to anyone because of the reliability issue  It is fine for the family that needs to rent one to use for a special trip but over the long haul  be prepared to pay the price for a Fix Or Repair Daily  FORD  That s how my wife and I have been feeling lately
