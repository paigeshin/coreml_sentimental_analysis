 About a year ago I sold my 1990 Ford Ranger STX 4x4  I had good reason to sell it  It was so incredibly unreliable  It was a four wheel drive regular cab short bed  It had a 5 speed manual transmission  2 9L V 6 engine  AM FM cassette  My Ranger was a nice looking off white with tan cloth interior and bucket seats with console  It was a very attractive truck  but constantly needed some kind of repair  Literally every month something went wrong with it  My father had given it to me because he knew I needed a vehicle and he wanted something newer  It wasn t terribly old though  It had about 114 000 miles on it and ran great  My father had the truck since new  and pampered it  Two weeks after he gave it to me  the engine started smoking really bad  I took it in to the local Ford dealer  They said it needed pretty much all new seals and gaskets  A  600 repair  A couple of weeks after that  the A C stopped working  a  400 repair  A month after that  I accidentally pressed the four wheel drive button and it got stuck on  I took it back to the Ford dealer  I was told that there was too much grease on the front hubs and it was causing the four wheel drive to stick  wrong  When I took it in for the third time to get the stupid four wheel drive fixed  I was told that it needed a new 4x4 engage disengage motor  This solved the problem  Within a month of that happening  the clutch started slipping  but didn t bother fixing it because I had already put so much money in to it and couldn t afford the clutch  At about the same time  the speedometer stopped working occasionally  I don t know if poor reliability like this is normal for a truck or not  but I will never buy a truck again  Not to mention that it was rediculously slow on the highway  You could floor the gas pedal without ANY acceleration  It got terrible gas mileage too  I only had it about six months during all of this before I traded it in for a car  Don t consider a truck unless you ABSOLUTELY need one  Trucks tend to be slow accelerating  gas guzzling  and unsafe vehicles compared to cheaper cars
