 I recently rented a late model Escort for a month  I m not one of those people whose identities are shaped and or expressed by a cool car    the more anonymous  the better  is my motto  Few cars are more generic than a beige Escort  I kept mistaking other cars for my rental  once even accidentally setting off the alarm on a similar looking sedan  I cravenly ran away before the owner could show up Under 45 miles per hour and 6 feet of driver height  this is generally a decent utilitarian car  It handles decently  especially in confined spaces like parking lots  is extremely easy to park  and goes in and out of first gear fairly snappily if somewhat twitchily  There s a surprising amount of interior space for such a small car  plenty for me   although I never use the back seats  so I can only speak for the front seats  The trunk is also quite roomy for a subcompact   I managed to shove a huge computer box in there  which wouldn t fit into the trunk of a midsize sedan  This would be a very nice car for running around town  especially if you re a woman However  most of my driving is done on Highway 101 in California  This is where the two biggest weaknesses of the Escort are revealed  it sucks on the freeway  and the gas tank is really really small  This car has no pickup at highway speeds   now that the speed limit in many states has been increased  this is a bigger concern than it might have been a couple years ago  The brakes are also correspondingly weak and squeaky  and cornering at highway speeds is not very secure feeling  The ride is also extremely rattle y  like small parts might be about to break off at any moment  Finally  with my 50 mile daily commute it seems like I rattle my way from one gas station to the next  I haven t been blown away by the mileage I m achieving either  which seems to be less than 20 miles per gallon Finally  this car is clearly designed for shorter drivers  I m 5 4 quot  The steering wheel is small  the car rides low  the dash is low  the ignition key is set super low  and the seat can be pushed forward so far your thighs can be trapped under the console  If you re a larger human being  you won t appreciate any of this br br
