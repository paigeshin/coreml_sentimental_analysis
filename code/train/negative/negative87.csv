 Pros  Looks nice when it s clean  Reliable so far  Sits up high like most SUVs  It s not too big nor too small  Priced fairly Cons  Poor gas mileage  18 MPG around town   20 MPG highway  The biggest single negative feature is the child restraints or lack of adequate restraints in the rear seats  Child seats tip going around corners  I have advised Ford of this problem and they have not seen fit to warn potential buyers I purchased this vehicle because it looked nice and I ve never owned an SUV  I haven t seen many Ford Explorer Sports on the road so far  probably because of the Firestone tire recall that was all over the news some weeks ago  I m told that Firestone tires on this vehicle are not affected by the recall because they are 16 inch tires EXTERIOR  8 I purchased a black SUV and it looks beautiful when clean and shiny  Unfortunately most black vehicles need a considerable amount of care  The design is just right for my taste  it s not too large  like some SUVs  but it does take some getting use to judging distances when parking  The middle windows have a slight tint and the rear windows have a darker tint  The rear window is dark enough so I don t have to change my inside rear view mirror at night INTERIOR  6 I give the interior a 6 primarily because of the potentially dangerous child car seat restraints are none existent  My two and three year old grandchildren were tipping back and forth going slow around turns  The rear seating is for two people  only  Seatbelts exist only for two people and no more  If I d noticed this when I was considering the purchase  I would not have bought the vehicle The interior color is grey with a synthetic leather which appears to wear on the drivers side very fast for only six months of use  ENGINE  8 The V6 appears to have adequate power  As mentioned earlier  my only difficulty comes with the poor fuel economy  Sorry  but there s no good excuse for poor gas mileage this day and age RIDE  6 The Ford Explorer Sport is a truck of sorts and rides like one  Obvioulsy not as smooth as a passenger car but I would have no problem taking this vehicle off road before I d take other passenger car  You will feel most small pot holes and cracks in the road HANDLING  7 Highway driving concerns me the most  I m very careful not to make any sudden steering control turns because I feel this vehicle will turn over like many SUVs have to date  This is probably do to the higher than normal center of gravity  The 4 wheel drive worked well during a recent snow storm  The brakes are beginning to grab and make noises already RELIABILITY  9 So far this SUV has been reliable  probably because I paid a considerably fee for extra protection at the dealership  Like anything else  I ll get very concerned when the extended warranty expires  Car are very expensive to repair VALUE  6 Considering the price  it s a fair value  not great  just fair EXTRA FEATURES  7 I purchased a model with a 6 CD Pioneer Changer in the dash  The CD works great THE VERDICT  I would not consider another Ford Explorer SPORT for my next purchase  There has to be much better products out there for a better price AVERAGE SCORE  7 125 out of 10 Comfort  Ok except on bumpy roads Quality  Little noise  but not too bad Roominess  Adequate Handling  amp  Control  Good Condition  New Model Year  2001 Model and options  Satisfactory Recommend to friends or family  NO
