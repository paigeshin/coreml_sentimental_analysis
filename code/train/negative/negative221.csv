 i bought my 1995 Ford Windstar GL brand new in 1995  i must have been drunk it was  18 000 with tax  and came with the 3 8L MPFI V 6 i have been the only owner of this Windstar and i Always take good care of all my vehicles  personally changing the oil religiously every 3000 miles  keeping them washed  engines always clean enough to eat off of  armor all the tires every week  etc  i am a car freak and enjoy taking care of my stable but within 3 years  this Ford Windstar received no less than 7 Factory Recalls some of the major ones are  Defective Head Gasket  but they wouldn t fix or replace unless there was Visible damage already  ie  white smoke  overheating  etc  the Ford dealership told me Not to bring it in for the  quot Recall Fix quot  unless it was already Broken  GRRR  Hood Separation at High Speed  the recall notice said at high speeds   the flimsy plastic hood may Separate  so they applied more glue to my hood  Side Door Reinforcement  the sliding side door needed to have a beam welded inside it  the Stupid Fat mechanic that was working on my car Cracked one of my inside door panels while performing this recall  when i informed the dealership of the damage  at first they Denied it  they said I broke it myself  after complaining to the service manager AND the dealership manager  they finally agreed to replacing the interior body panel the mechanic broke  but the part had to be Special Ordered  which took a week  and another few days for them to Install it  GRRR  Transmission Fluid Pan was Leaking like Crazy  it was leaking ATF fluid faster than i could pour it in  my van had first developed a slow tranny pan leak after about 10K miles  but the Ford dealership told me it was a  quot normal maintanance quot  problem and Not a Defect  so i had to fix it myself  grrrr  Gas Tank Reinforcement  the recall notice said the cheap plastic gas tank may Crack or Leak in high temperature conditions  so a flimsy metal strap was installed to  quot reinforce quot  it Nitpicky Complaints  the Rear Bench Seats are Very Heavy  have a friend help you remove install the rear bench seats or you ll mess up your back  the window cranks  on non electric window  are in a very Awkward location  almost all the way to the floor and toward the front  Don t try to open close your windows while driving  Seatbelts are very uncomfortable  Rearview mirrors are awkward  especially at night  the Air Intake duct sits Very Low  sucking in air at tire level from the front driver side  Don t drive thru even low flood waters or your engine will suck in water right thru the air intake duct  this happened to a friend of mine as he drove thru a small puddle and his 3 8L engine was Mangled Needless to say  i will NEVER buy a Ford EVER again  what a complete Nightmare buy a Toyota or Honda instead  they are Worth the extra money br br
