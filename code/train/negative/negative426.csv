 When you think of Mustangs  the first thing that comes to mind is a muscle car Mustangs have long been classified with such cars as camaros  firebirds  chevlles  and others  But the question for this model is that with the new sporty look of the exterior  which looks gay to me    does the engine and the rest of the car hold up to my expectations  As a young car enthusiast  I went to a local Ford dealership and saw a nice GT Mustang with a V8 in it Very nice   When I say that the Monte Carlo is better here s why  I drive a 1995 Monte Carlo with a 5 year warranty on everything and I got the car for only 8 000 dollars  more than half what I would have to pay for a new Mustang My car is better looking  more powerful since I added a Venom Computer Module which totaled my horsepower to nearly 300hp  and my car will last just as long with its warranty REMEMBER  THIS IS EPINIONS  MEANING IT S MY OPINION i b Exterior b The new model designs I don t particularily like I am more into a bigger car   or if it s smaller and sportier like the new Mustangs  I would like them with a lower center of gravity and with a big sporty spoiler on the back I would ve liked it if they would ve come out with more of a japanese car like version of the mustang if they wanted to create a more sporty version of the car  Yet  with this edition of the Mustang  the car is small  not good for a four seater  and looks awful to me It doesn t really have a racer type look that Ford tried to do with the vehicle   Interior b  The changes compared to an older 1994 model of the Mustang sport very few changes which make me disgust this car There are cheap plastic dash boards for one thing They look very potentially destructive in the way that even a little whap would break it The manual shift control is a pain in the butt Not only is the car a manual  something I hate but have to live with  but the shifter blocks the controls to the CD deck  The climate control was bland  like in any Ford I would recommend Chevy s as being best for a nicely weathered interior Getting into the back seat is much more difficult than I expected Rather pain in the butt task to perform The car is kinda low   and elderly  or just plain old  people will have trouble getting into the small back of the car It is more suited for 16 30 year olds  The unspacious trunk of the car is another bad part of the model If you want a big truck with a sporty look  I d recommend getting a Chevy Monte Carlo   Engine b  The new V6 engine is pretty nice with a 3 8L with 190hp which is nice  but not as good as my much cheaper Monte Carlo which has 215hp But  if you were to invest a little bit more money you could buy a V8 Mustang with 260hp and 220 pounds of torque If you ever put the pedal to the metal in a V8 model  you would feel that power immediately This thing will whip you back like a rag doll  If your thinking about getting a Mustang for the power  don t  A camaro will give you around a 5 2L with a lot more horsepower for only a couple thousand more dollars   Driven b  The drive is nice When you race it against another car  or just press the acceleration all the way  the car makes a nice rumble which will make you squeal like a school girl with excitement The handling of the car was decent It was a lot better than my Monte being a much heavier vehicle  the Monte is Taking turns and corners   the Mustang handles nicely I would have to say   Price b  The car is not a good deal at all  I would recommend buying an older Mustang if you were interested The only good thing about buying a car like this is that they are very easy to upgrade and modify thanks to numerous magazines devoted to it  where s my Monte Carlo magazine   Versions b  The Mustang comes in either basic V6 form  a V8 GT engine  or a Cobra style one which I am not sure how it handles But  my friend told me that a Mustang Cobra is a lot more powerful and a lot more expensive as well   Bottom Line b If you have 20 000 to blow on a car  I would not recommend spending it on a Mustang Buying a nice Firebird with a V8 and a lot more horsepower and torque with a better interior and exterior look is a much better investment
