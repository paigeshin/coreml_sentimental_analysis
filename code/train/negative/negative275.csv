 Last year  my wife needed a newer car than the  85 Buick she was driving  I had read reviews and information about the Contour touting it as a pretty good all around car  I was worried about crash worthiness though  If I remember correctly  the Contour doesn t usually score well in all areas of crash protection  When I factored in all the considerations I decided to stick with the Contour nonetheless  I do still  quot like quot  the car  The biggest reasons are the comfort of the car in general  the mid range size of the car that wasn t easy to find in other models  the seats  the fuel economy  and the way it looks  If only  quot looks quot  were everything  The worst of the bad news about this car is that although it is only going on 4 years old it feels like it s going on 10 years old  It hasn t quite gone over 80 000 miles yet but you d think it had gone way past  Further  we have just started experimenting with putting a car seat in the back for our baby and it doesn t look like it s going to be a good fit  Also  if you need the rear seatback to fold down  at least on this non sport model  you can t  I agree with any of the professional consumer mags out there that say body integrity is poor  Also  mechanically for the most part  we don t have much confidence  If you own one of these and you haven t had trouble with the brakes yet you are very lucky  Ours needs 4 new rotors because it vibrates or shimmies when it comes to a stop most of the time  The car has been driven on the highway most of it s life and it already feels like it could use a whole new suspension under some circumstances  The engine is noisy in most situations other than cruising at a steady speed and the car could use a little more power  The car often stalls out after it s first started  Thank goodness I can t think of much to say about the transmission although it s nothing to rave about  Looking back on it  although we certainly could have done worse than we did  we wish we hadn t been so patriotic  If we had bought a Honda  Subaru  Toyota  or Nissan even if it would have had a few more miles on it  I would probably be writing a more positive review now
