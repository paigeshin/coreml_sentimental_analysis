 As a new vehicle this was a grand choice  I have the V 6 LX Model which is by far a more well rounded vehicle than the Turbo GT Model  I have found the reliability to be greater than the Turbo as well  However all cars age  and the Probe has done better than most other American cars I ve experienced  but holds no match to a foreign make  Normal wear items  like both CV Joints have failed  as well as the car now eats  literally  brake pads  Some other items have died early on  such as the A C Unit has not worked in a while  and looks to cost over  800 to repair  Also the fan switch for the climate control has quit  This should be a normal relay  but everyone I consult as well as my manuals say I need Climate Control parts because it has a high tech system  However it does not have Automatic Climate Control to my knowledge  The body has held up well  just recently falling victim to surface rust  and that sin a harsh New England Climate  It has a leak in the rear  somewhere  according to Ford  that causes some havoc on the electrical system every now and then  To purchase one now would be risky  I would recommend searching long and hard for a perfect model br br
