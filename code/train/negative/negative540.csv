 I can remember when the explorers first came on the market and I vowed I would someday own one  I loved the looks of them  At the time though we had only one child and room was not a factor  We have had our Explorer for almost 2 years and it wasn t the best choice of vehicles for us  We went from a Pontiac Minivan so the lack of room was definitely noticed  The kids never have enough room for their  quot stuff quot  and constantly fight over it  As far as driving an explorer  we needed a 4x4 because of our muddy roads and snow and it s rough riding  If you are wanting a leisurely drive I don t recommend the this vehicle  We have recently had some problems with it too  but it may be just OUR vehicle  It will not start on occasion and fortunately hasn t left me completely stranded  It will turn over but it sounds like it s out of gas  We took it in to get it checked but they can t figure it out  One minute it won t start and 5 minutes later it will      drives me crazy  In the are of comfort for me it s just not very appealing there either  I need room for my purse  and anything else I need for work and if I m the only one it s okay but get another adult in and there s just no room for us either I have to drive 18 miles one way to work every day so gas mileage is another factor  I only get around 17mpg  However  no matter what vehicle I choose I will be faced with this because I need a bigger vehicle that sits me up higher and has 4 x 4  Overall  I don t  quot hate quot  my explorer  but now that I ve had one I ve satisfied my curiosity and will not own another for a main vehicle  We should have chosen the expedition    If you have children I wouldn t recommend this vehicle if you want any room at all  However for a single person or two person family it would be fine  It will seat 5 but adults struggle to sit comfortably in the back
