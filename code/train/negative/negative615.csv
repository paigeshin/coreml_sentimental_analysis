 I bought this car right after 9 11 out of a misguided attempt to show patriotism  After being treated poorly by the VW and Honda dealers despite driving up in a brand new Saab wagon and willing to pay cash  the ford dealer was actually the only place willing to deal  That was where the good part of the ownership experience ended  I have had 13 unscheduled service visits to three different ford dealers in the 16 000 miles I have driven since recieveing my car with 4 miles on the odomometer  That does not include 2 cracked windshields due to a faulty design on the windscreen roof intersection  The stereo still does not work other then presets 1 and 6 on fm2 despite 3 fixes and one replacement  and this is only true when the faceplate does not pop off the radio over any pothole or expansion joint  The alignment is continuously in need of adjustment  the air conditioner refuses to work  the trunk will not stay shut unless slammed so hard that your hand is bruised by the awful spoiler that I ordered my car without  The stablility control does not consistantly work to the parameters specified by ford but no fualt can ever be found  until 36000 miles rolls around  the engine will run for 3 seconds with the clutch in  having been at idle and the key out of the ignition  the clutch slips already due to the perevious problem  the parking brake does not work even on slight hills and the car will not always engage first gear when shut off due to the running engine problem  There are numerous rattles in a car where the only thing that is in it most times is the rubberized owners manual  The windshield wiper wear out in 2 months  the defroster and demister are not up to even Virginia winters  and the heated mirrors don t work at all  The rear seatbacks will not consistatly lock upright  and the automatic power window can no longer be overridden  the fix would involve a new door or complete disasembly which would yield more rattles  I average 21 3 mpg in maily highway drving with the occasional trip to the golf course or store  This is due to the lack of a sixth gear which causes the engine to run at 3400 3800 rpm at cruising speeds on our higher speed interstates in the south  The paint is easily damaged  and the headlights are basically ineffective on the lowbeam setting  The seats are uncomfortable  engine harsh  clutch downright wierd in it s action  shift light annoining and it s use will yield a stall in most instances  The traction control does not work and in snow actually needs to be defeated in order to be able to start forward motion  it locks the drive wheels and digs them in to the snow when there is some freeze up overnight  and the ford ski rack is awful  The dealer service for the ford is abismal at all locations  and loaner cars for major waranty repairs that take days are non existant even at the selling dealer  a  blue oval  one at that  My friend with a 1985 Volvo 240 with 300 000 miles on the origonal engine  transmission  clutch  and belts will not drive my car due to the reliablilty issues and feeling of driving around in a tin can  Her car has a rear door held to the car and hinges by duct tape and bondo  And the  leather wraped steering wheel  must be covered with bionic cow hide
