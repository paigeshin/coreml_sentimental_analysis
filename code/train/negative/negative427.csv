 This is my third time owning a Mustang  I purchased 2000 GT Convertible August 1999  my dream car  this is my third and the other 2 had transmission and BIG engine problems  But I just knew this Mustang was going to be different  Laserred  camel color top and leather seats  CD player  Mach sound system and all the bells and whistles  The gas wasn t bad but the pick up wasn t as fast as I had driven in Camero s and Firebirds  When I had the top up  because of rain and most of the time I drove with the top down in the rain  as long as you drive you won t get wet  I could hear a humming noise in the rear of the car  Every week it got louder  It just didn t squeal when I wanted it to  The car was sluggish  I had just turned in my 1998 Mustang Convertible 6 cylinder because there were transmission problems with it and I heard the 8 cylinder didn t have the same problems  WRONG It ended up that some bearings or something in the rear end were no good to begin with  When we got the car back it seemed faster but over a few weeks time it began making noise again  We don t drive it fast all the time and we didn t do anything out of the ordinary to make this happen  This car was having problems from the moment we purchased it NEW  The leather seats were nice but they are low to the ground and your legs are extended so it is not as comfortable as a car but it s better than other sports cars I ve ridden in  The sound system is to die for  We live in south Florida and it s HOT there and we put the top up and the sun beats on the canvas and the a c doesn t compensate for the heat  The canvas lets the heat in the car  We sweat like a hore in church  that s how hot it gets in the summer riding in the Mustang with the top up 28 000 you would think they could build a car that would last  It isn t worth the money  For the third time I m disappointed  Read my review on the 1998 Laserred Mustang Convertible and the 1995 White Mustang Convertible I purchased a Ford Ranger in 1994 and was happy with it  Not a problem  Ford knows how to do trucks  but cars  that s a different story Needless to say we traded the Mustang in on a 2001 Explorer Sports Trac We love it  We are cured of Mustang fever We miss the Mustang a lot  the dealer gave us  22 000 trade in after only 1 year and they are now selling it for  25 500  They will make a nice profit on it  We felt that if we kept the vehicle that we would have continuous problems with the rear end and transmission br br
