 What a car  I test drove one today and loved it  I was not expecting to be impressed  I was expecting to cross this vehicle off of my list of prospective purchases in the next month or so It all started when a girl in my study hall started bragging about hers  Of course from here I had to make fun of it constantly  One day she had enough of it and took me for a ride   I never made fun of it again  b Pros  The 1996 Thunderbird LX I test drove was definitely a well equipped car  It had power windows  door locks and mirrors that worked well  The windows came down at an average pace  This car came with a CD player from the factory in 1996  as well as an alarm keyless entry  The keyless entry was just as good as any I ve seen from the factory  Poor range  but at least it was there  The trunk release was very nice on the key ring  The trunk release in the car was kind of hard to find  but under the armrest is a nice place after you know where it is at The  3 8 L  V6  with  Fuel Injection  put a hefty amount of power to the ground for a non turbo V6 in a medium weight car  I d estimate quarter mile time to be about 18 and 0 60 time to be about 13 seconds  The speedometer goes to 120 mph and I m certain this car could do it  It even sounded pretty nice  a little on the whiny side  but still an agressive sound The dash is well laid out with the speedometer and tachometer  The other five gauges oil pressure  temp  fuel  amperes meter  and something else I can t remember  were small and oddly placed  I have no doubt that you would get used to them quickly  though I felt like I was in the driver seat of a truck this thing was so roomy  My legs were not cramped  the seat was easily adjustable  Both of my arms were rested nicely  The steering wheel had an adjustable height  which the salesman insisted I had too high  I lowered it and felt cramped  but where I initially had it  it was very nice The deep blue interior matched the sky blue exterior very nicely  The seats were plush and comfortable  The rear seat offered a lot more room than I was expecting  similar to my Blazer  It felt very comfortable  It would be easy to fall asleep in the back seats  Easily sitting four people comfortably  The transmission drive shaft hump and the distance the center consol came back made the center seat useless This car did not afford the gas mileage I would hope for  but the salesman insisted that it would get 22 mpg city  This is a decent number  especially when you can have as much fun in this car as you can  The rear wheel drive was the culprit named by the salesman in the lost gas mileage  I m not sure how this could have effected it  but he did seem to know a lot about cars Handling was a dream  I was darting in and out of traffic to the dismay of the salesman  with no body roll  I took a Clover Leaf onramp at 80 mph and a car could not have been more sturdy under me  I believe with a larger engine  I easily could have gone faster and been as secure With a rear defogger and nice windshield wipers  your view would be unobstructed  For a coupe  there was a good bit of visibility both by looking back or in the mirrors  I did not check the blind spots  but they seem like it would be a very small space This is the most beautiful car Ford ever designed  Compared to this  the Mustang is a pug nosed box b Neutral  My friends 1989 Turbo had automatic seatbelts  This one didn t  According to the salesman  the government had outlawed them for two reasons  First because when the motor died  people could not put the belt on  Second because the pillar was too far forward and instead of holding someone back at the chest  it would move up to their throats  The manual safetybelts were an inconvenience  but I can definitely see their pros Although the driver seat felt as though it would be comfortable for long trips  it did not offer Lumbar support  A pillow would fix that problem  The headrests left something to be desired  although I m sure they could be adjusted with a bit of force To open the hood took a bit of effort  something that you would not grow accustomed to  This would only be a minor inconvenience The dealer said that you could not get fog lights for this vehicle  This disappointed me because I think it would look very aggressive with a set close to the ground  When I tried to engage the fog lights  the head light dial came apart  It was easily put back on  but it was surprising the cheap quality of the plastic b Cons  These are few  the only thing I noticed was that the engine was kind of crammed into the engine bay  Maintenance could be difficult  There are lots of wires running around  and other intrusive things  Timing would be a breeze though  with the location of the distributor the salesman called it something else  but I can t recall The trunk space was adequate  but the seat would not fold down  The spare tire was a donut when it appeared that a full size could have fit The size of the rear tires 255 mm across  made it impossible to spin or even squawk the tires  Admittedly  you don t need to do this  but it is always nice to be able to make some noise  Perhaps in a Turbo V6 or V8 version The automatic transmission was very smooth  It shifted delicately and wasn t constantly searching for the right gear  It only shifted down if I really hit the gas  I m certain a significant amount of power was lost here  My mothers Blazer has a 4300 Vortec V6 with an automatic transmission  It will squawk the tires from a standstill  I drove an S15 Sonoma with a 4 3 Liter V6 with TBI Throttle Body Injection  that yielded 28 hp over the Vortec  The GMC was a manual and I couldn t keep the rear end on the ground  I could feel much more power being put on the ground with the manual transmission  The  96 T Bird  does not have a Manual transmission option   You can get a  95 T Bird Supercoupe with manual transmission  but with the supercharged V6 your insurance is going to skyrocket  I can t believe Ford put only automatic transmissions in a car that seems like it has such sporty potential b Overall  I would recommend this car to my older friends  It is a good price  lots of features  very comfortable  The power is ok and it is a gorgeous car  It is not an economy car by any means  but you ll have a lot of fun driving it I do not recommend this car to anyone that wants a sports car because you will have such a hard time regaining the performance out of it that is lost with the automatic transmission If this car came with a manual transmission  I would probably purchase one I discussed the new T Bird with the sales man  he said he really liked the styling  I for one strongly disagree with Ford s design in this new car br br
