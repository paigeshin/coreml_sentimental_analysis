 My wife loves the Explorer but she is 5 5 quot  tall  I m 6 2 quot  and this vehicle is not made for people our height  We had an XLT for 3 years and upgraded to an Eddied Bauer with a sunroof  Big mistake for me because I can t sit straight up  Also  when will Ford learn to place their rearview mirror higher up on the windshield  I think they are the only manufacturer that still mounts the mirror to the windshield so it s right in the way  Also  the seats do not have ANY head restraints for somebody over 6  tall  I m surprised FORD has not gotten dinged for this  The Limited version has this option but this is not the standard model Overall  my wife loves it so we re stuck with it but I do not recommend it to a person with above average height br br
