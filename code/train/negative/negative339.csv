 We bought a used 1995 Ford Aerostar in 1998  Our initial reason for buying the van was that we have 4 children  2 of which are still in car seats  With a family that size  our options were very limited Initially we were pleased because with the 2 bench seats as well as the 2 front seats  it is a 7 passenger vehicle  which made it roomy enough for our crowd  Even with the 2 car seats  there was still plenty of room for the other 2 older boys to sit comfortably without being squished  And during road trips our boys could get comfortable  lay their head on a pillow positioned over the arm rest and go to sleep while still buckled securely into their seats  Also  since we had the extended cargo area van  there was plenty of room for hauling  whether it was the futon bed we bought for our toddler when it came time for him to move from the crib  or the computer desk  or all our luggage when driving from California to D  C  Roominess was never a problem with this van What was a problem was lousy gas mileage  Another problem was the frequent problems with the front end alignment  It seemed to never stayed aligned  regardless of how excellent a condition the roads were in  Also the van drives very heavily  What I mean by this is that when going around curves or making a turn  it leans on it s side and makes you feel like you are going to tip over  True  this vehicle is built like a tank  and if it did tip over  we d probably be safe  But I m not willing to take that chance  Also  the manuverability for changing lanes  pulling into parking spaces or any of the other simplist driving tasks  is terrible  The simplists tasks become major chores in this van  And the fact that it squeeks and rattles and makes a lot of noise doesn t make matters any better Also  I have to admit that I did not like the air conditioning vents for the back  They did not cool  or heat  the back area of the van very well  Even the children in the bench seat closest to the front of the van were often either not warm enough or not cool enough Also  on the driver s side in the passenger area  there are some controls for the stereo  While this may seem a good idea for some  it was a source of constant annoyance for us  The children loved to play with the buttons and were constantly changing the radio station I can give this van one more bit of praise  For those of you out there that have a large family and are frequently taking road trips  the bench seats in the van can be taken out easily  and rearranged  We had the big bench in front at some points  at other points it was the small bench in front  But the arrangement that we used the most often and was what the children seemed to enjoy the most was when we had the front bench face backwards so that on road trips the children could be buckled in securely  and yet still interact with each other and share toys back and forth And finally  one last warning  During the 1 1 2 yrs we had this van we constantly had mechanical problems with it  Also  since the front end alignment was frequently off  the tires wore down unevenly very quickly and had to be replaced more quickly then they would have been otherwise br br
