 I bought my 97 Ranger in 2000 and must say that overall it has been a good vehicle  My two major gripes are the cabspace and lack of acceleration  On a short trip  10 Min  the Truck is fine  after that you ll start squirming and trying to stretch your legs if 6  tall or more Want to try and merge onto the freeway  DON T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT COWBOY  Unless you ve got a good 150 yard headstart  The gears are very tall  One minor gripe is the 2 spark plugs per cylinder  twice as expensive for tune ups due to double plugs and wires  Another gripe are the electrical problems  Ford is infamous for it s  Check Engine Light  Mine came on twice since I owned the truck Only one time did it cost me  Highlights are  Price  affordable  Utility  move stuff fridges  kegs  sofas  Durability  fairly low maintenance
