 This was my first car  I got it the day I got my drivers license  It was used  but it seemed like a good deal  And not to say anything too bad about it  this car served its purpose and got me around safely throughout high school and my first year at college  However it is really not that terrific of a vehicle  and it has some problems along with its good points First of all the alignment is off   completely  Once when I got the tires rotated the servicer told me that there was no use in balancing them  they would just be unaligned the second i drove over a bump  And he was right  the wheels never failed to unalign themselves quickly  This caused the tires to wear unevenly  and it was annoying having to pull the steering wheel 20 degrees to the right to get the car to go straight Also the paint job on this car was pretty awful  Every time I would dry the car after washing it my towels would be completely red  Also the black paint around the windows on my car chipped off   and every other tempo I have seen has this same problem Lastly the speakers were pretty bad  one of them buzzed continuously whenever any base was turned on  I did have a great time in this car  It was a fun and great to drive around my small town  but it is not a powerful vehicle  and it does not handle very well  I would not reccomend buying one of these used vehicles  My old one now sits in a car graveyard after busting a rod through the engine  Check out my review of the Mitsubishi Mirage to see how much happier I am now br br
