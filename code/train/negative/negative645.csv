 I have leased a 97 Thunderbird now for almost 3 years  I have had it since it was new  I leased the car based on it s nameplate and v 8 power  The car has good styling and roominess  The power from the 4 6L engine is impressive and a pleasure when on the highway  I wouldn t opt for the 3 8L v 6 for a car this size  All the controls are well laid out to give you a sports car feel  but not the sports car s lack of space  The seats could use more support though  Long rides might be tiresome for those that prefer stiffer seats  The six way power driver s seat is nice to get you in just the right position  and the tilt wheel will help finish getting you into that right position  The premium sound stereo is not bad for a factory unit and will make most people happy  The semi automatic climate control isn t the greatest  There aren t many positions to bring just fresh air in  Most times you are either using the heater or the air conditioning  These extremes will do the job though  I do prefer the older R 12 refrigerant though  it does a much better job at cooling the interior than the newer R 134a  The two major downfalls on this car are it s handling and brakes  The brakes are typical Ford  not enough for the vehicle  You will be able to stop but you ll wish you had more brakes than you do  The ABS works well  The electronic traction assist although doesn t  On anything less than clean  dry roads you will have to pay attention to what the car is doing  This is easy to tell though by the feel you get in the seat  Much of this might have to do with the independent rear suspension  I don t believe Ford put enough effort into putting the right springs in the rear of the car  It always sits high in the back which might be taking away from downforce on the rear for better traction  This could be fixed  if you are an avid automotive lover  by aftermarket springs  These would level the look of the car and lower it just a little  all this would enhance the independent suspension  Many finer cars from BMW  Mercedes Benz  the Corvette all use this type of suspension to give their cars a better ride  If Ford had done a little more work the Thunderbird would have been a much better car  This car is not for novice drivers or drivers who can t keep an eye on what their car is doing  For those drivers who like a challenging car or a car that would test their driving skills this is the car for you  I am still undecided on whether or not I will purchase this car at the end of it s lease  The power is comparable to a Mustang GT or Sport Package Crown Victoria  It s size is more roomier than a Mustang and with a few upgraded parts would probably run better than the Mustang  The pride in owning a Thunderbird is in it s nameplate  a nameplate with history  More history than the Camaro  Firebird Trans Am and Mustang  It originally was the leading sports car from the U S  until Chevrolet started making a more potent Corvette
