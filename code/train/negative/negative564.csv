 I bought this car as a second vehicle and used it only for work in another city  It was a GL model with an automatic transmission and 72K miles on it  I paid  5350 for the car and it had a leaking radiator when I bought it  The owner prior to me was trying to sell the car for over  6000 and I was the only offer  The cup holder had long since broken off due to its flimsy design  After the radiator was fixed  for  400  it ran fine for the next six thousand miles  It does seem to have a lot of road noise  though  In freezing weather it also had a distinct knock from the timing belt slapping the top of the timing belt cover  After the engine warmed up and the metal expanded  the knock would stop  Thinking the timing belt was simply stretched  I had it replaced for  300 including new ignition wires and plugs  I never drove it in freezing weather again so I do not know if the new belt corrected the problem Since I moved to a new city I tried to sell the car for the retail price  No takers  no phone calls  I lowered the price to  1000 under retail with still no takers or phone calls  Finally I had to ship the car to my new address  Again I tried to sell the car for  5700  i e  half way between retail and wholesale according to edmunds com  with not one single phone call in the entire Seattle area  I finally offered the car for  5200  which is only  250 above wholesale  I only got three phone calls  The car only had 79K miles on it All during this time the car simply disintegrated  The main seal at the flywheel began to leak prodigiously  The car also had a distinct oil smell in the air conditioning system when I stopped at traffic lights  I had to re seat the valve cover gasket  taken off for the timing belt  because it is a poor design and is easily mangled during installation  The car also began to hesitate severely  I believe this was tied to the  Check Engine  light which began illuminating periodically  Finally the car would not always start  which I believe was a failing starter solenoid I eventually sold it for  5000 but had to split the repair costs with the new owner In conclusion  even when the car ran fine I could not get even close to the book values and finally sold it for  50 above wholesale  In addition the car required over  1700 in repair bills for just 8000 miles of wear  Needless to say I would not recommend the Contour
