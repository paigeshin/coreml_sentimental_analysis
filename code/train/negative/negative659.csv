 Do you know those days that seem perfect  just because of a little pleasant surprise   Something like that happened to me in the early spring of  98  I was traveling to King of Prussia  PA  and was just picking up my rental at the Philly Airport Hertz  I was expecting the usual Ford Contour  but I got a Ford Mustang instead  I felt like I was actually able to enjoy the ride this time Let me tell you that the Mustang is normally not my kind of vehicle  I think I m a little too old  early thirties  for its target group  and I normally prefer Japanese or German convertibles for my sport cars  But hey  what did I have to loose  The first thing I noticed when I got into the car was a strange smell  It smelled like a mixture of cleaner and bananas  I could explain the cleaner and then I found a ton of banana peels stuffed under the driver s seat  Who had been driving this thing before   Okay  but back to the vehicle itself  I liked the way it looked  It was a glossy black  and I like the older body style quite a bit I was surprised by its low rpm pickup  realizing that it was only the six cylinder model Highway driving was great and very comfortable  with enough of reserves to pass when needed I had a ball pulling it out of the parking lot and getting it onto the freeway  The only thing that irked me was the somewhat jerky automatic transmission  yet it shifted predictably and at what seemed the right time for me The interior was typical for Ford  Cloth seats with lots of plastic around  but rather practical  I don t mind that kind of styling in my truck  but in a sporty vehicle   But I had to remind myself that this car is actually rather inexpensive So  rather pleased with the vehicle I arrived at my hotel  planning to take it out again for a spin the next day  To those who don t know the area  This part of Pennsilvania is very hilly  with plenty of nice low traffic sideroads  Taking the car through the hills and turns was something I had looked forward to Boy  was I in for a surprise  I was owning a Mazda Miata at that time  and I approached the corners the same way I would have in the Miata  The Mustang started to fishtail  and I had to put quite some effort into preventing the excessive oversteer from turning into a spin I thought it was a fluke  so I tried the next turn and the result was the same  I slowed down quite a bit after that  Returning to the hotel I checked the car  Tire inflation seemed to be fine and I couldn t detect any damage to the rims   At least as far as my visible inspection went  I didn t have a tire gauge with me I didn t take to cars  to the hills  after that and drove it around town It pains me to give a  do not recommend  to this vehicle  because I liked it quite a bit  It looks great and is very affordable  I m sure that one can have plenty of fun with it  But I would recommend it too a friend  because it is just too easy to be overconfident and use the power beyond what the car or the suspension can handle
