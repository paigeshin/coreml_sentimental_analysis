 The F350 v10 Longbed Crewcab has a hidden problem that Ford has documented  but does not freely inform the buyer that there is a problem with the rear drive line  In that due to its length it has the potential to vibrate at highway speeds due to the angle inwhich the drive line sits I found out the hard way by purchasing this  35000 00 vehicle and dealing with the dealership run around  The vehicle was returned due to the fact that they said that the problem could not be fixed but that it would not damage the vehicle to drive it that way  That was all fine and dandy but when I asked them to put that in writing so that if that part failed they would fix it for as long as I owned the vehicle  to me that means that we re not willing to back up our product but have a nice day  The vehicle was givin back although it had a comfortable riding with plenty of room for the family as well as for hauling  Excellent power and fuel mileage for this large of a vehicle  In all its a good looking truck that I would purchase again but only if they have fixed the potential problem with the drive line br br
