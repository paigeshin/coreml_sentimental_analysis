 You might be asking why I named my opinion  quot Turbo Pinto quot  Well as a high school graduation gift my father gave me his old 1991 Ford Taurus SHO  The car was purchased brand new in 1991  with every option you can think of  The color on the outside was white and the interior was black leather  The vehicle has 220 horsepower and it is a stick shift  In the two years that I drove the vehicle it has been repaired at least once a month  The repairs alone would cost more than  1000 and the mechanic would take up to a month to fix the problems  In the two years I owned the car my father spent out over  7000 fixing the problems  At this time I was just starting college and needed a reliable car to drive  my Taurus did not do its job  Problems I encountered the last time I drove the car were the temperature of the car was always hot due to the coolant holder always leaking  electrical system would malfunction during warm temperature days  the brakes sweaked profusly   my favorite one  the air conditioning system would only work for ten minutes and last but not least the factory stereo broke  I DO NOT recommend buying this car  it is a complete lemon  My Taurus deserves the title of TURBO PINTO  It is unreliable and will put you in the poor house by the amount of the repairs cost
