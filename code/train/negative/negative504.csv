 My husband owns a 1993 Ford Thunderbird and it has caused us nothing but a headache and has put a whole in our bank account  At 38 000 miles he had a problem with the electrical system  At 40 000 miles he had to have all of the brakes and drums and etc  replaced in which was a cost of 1 000 00 at 42 000 miles the head gaskets blew the cost to repair this was 2 500 00  Now there is 52 000 miles and two of the motor mounts need to be replaced  the driver side door won t stop chiming when you have the lights on  The molding on the drivers side is coming off  I know my husband isn t to blame for these problems because he babies his cars and he is a very excellent driver  This car does have excellent pickup  handles uphill with ease  When driving in rain or snow the rear end tends to sway while making turns  The interior is very spacious  seats five with enough extra space to seat six  even if all the passengers were six feet tall  The trunk space is very spacious The long roomy look this car has is very appealing but once you own one it s not worth it s looks br br
