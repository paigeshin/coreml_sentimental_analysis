 Ford has once again tried to bring back the Thunderbird  But let s face it  The car that has carried the Thunderbird name for half a century has really been about five or six distinctly different cars  Other than the name  these cars have nothing in common  The only version that sparked any interest was the 1950 s T Bird s  And the 1950 s were the last time a Thunderbird was ever a respected and exciting vehicle  It s been a downward spiral ever since with the exception of the SuperCoupe from 1989 1995  arguably the fastest T birds ever made I own a 1989 Thunderbird and it happens to be a very ordinary passenger car with the exception of some luxury features not found on other vehicles  The 2003 Thunderbird is more of the same except with a different look  and a grossly inflated price  Who is going to pay  65 000 for a Lincoln with a T Bird name on it  These days it seems that anything with a different look is popular  regardless of what lies underneath  And what lies underneath is the same Thunderbird I drive everyday  which was less than half the price compared to the 2003 The fact is  the Thunderbird lost its   Mojo  after the 50 s and became yet another family car with a puny engine It s hard to imagine that this car was EVER compared to Corvette s  It would be like Ferrari taking the Maranello  adding room for four people  popping in a 200hp engine  and raising the price to a million dollars  Anyone interested  Didn t think so For the T Bird to be reborn  Ford needs to drop a big time V8 engine in it  with somewhere in the neighbourhood of 350 400 horsepower and 5 second 0 60 times  Then we will have the Thunderbird the way it was meant to be originally  A sports car again  Chris
