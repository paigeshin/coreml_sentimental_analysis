 From experience  I would have to say that this car is not worth the money you would spend on it  This was my first car and it had eighty thousand miles on it  It is a six cylinder  3 0 liter  From the start  I have had problems with my breaks  causing me to have them replaced four times in two years  One time my break pads actually fell out about three months after i had them fixed Other problems that reoccured with my taurus is the transmission and motor mounts  I had to replace my transmission two time in eight months  The same with my motor mounts  When I finally got rid of my car  the transmission was dying again and it has only been seven months since the last time it broke  My motor mounts have cracked open twice  both time when I was driving  My alternator died twice  again when I was driving  At the time that I got rid of my car  the alignment was getting unaligned for no reason  I would be driving and it would get worse and worse I know another person who had a 1989 taurus gl and she has had the same problems  I heard of a recall for a certain part of the car and went to check it out and I found that there are many parts on recall for this car I do have to say that this car does hold up well in an accident  though  I hit a car from behind and I was going about 25 m p h and all I really had to replace was the radiator  My air bag did not go out but that might have been because of the angle I hit the car at  Neither my passenger or I was hurt at all  despite being thrown forward I like the interior of the car because it was very roomy and I could fit many people in there  The trunk is spacious and the only downfall to that is things can get lost easily in there  There was a dead spot in the steering wheel of about an inch in each direction  When my brakes did work  the anti lock system proved to be very effective  This car is affected by the wind a lot though  Perhaps not as much as a smaller car  but more than I would like a car of that size to  My rear view mirror has fallen off about four times one summer but that was the only summer that it did that  That is an easy fix though  My cup holder would stick a lot also  It was the type that would just push right into the dashboard  The change holder was very conveniently placed  right under the radio
