 I bought a used 1987 Ford Tempo GL for my wife  At first  it was a good car  But then  things went wrong  I had to put several hundred dollars into the car in the past 2 years  the air conditioner don t work  I had to replace the computer  and it s still running bad  I guess I should have got the hint when we found all the paperwork on the car and there where several receipts from mechanic work done on the car  And I have seen several Tempo s on the side of the road broke down  I also know that Tempo s have an exhaust leak problem  I ve seen a lot of Tempo s that are very load because the muffler need to be replaced  The car is a nice car  don t get me wrong  but I think there are mechanical problems with it that make this car a bad choice br br
