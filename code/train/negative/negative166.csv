 I bought my 1996 Ford Taurus at a dealership in Powhatan Virginia because I loved the way it handled and the way it looked  In addition I spoke with other Taurus owners  and was told that you couldn t beat the Taurus 3 liter engine for dependability  I was a happy owner for the first 2 years  Then one day  my wife was driving the Taurus with my 2 children buckled in the back seat  when the engine overheated badly  She found a place to pull over  as the steam came pouring out from the cracks under the hood  She called me  and I had the car towed to the nearest service station that evening  The problem was that a freeze plug had corroded so badly  it finally gave way The mechanic informed me that there was also a lot of rust in the cooling system  He replaced the freeze plug  and flushed the cooling system  About 2 months later  I had the same problem  rusty water pouring out of a badly corroded freeze plug  I took the car to my regular mechanic  and he informed me that there was a recall on my Taurus for which I was never notified  The reason I was given for the recall was that Ford had manufactured the 1996 Taurus 3 liter engine and installed it in the vehicle without treating the inside of the block with a rust inhibitor I had the vehicle towed to the nearest Ford dealer  and they reimbursed me for the freeze plug that I had had replaced at the service station  treated the block and replaced the most recently corroded freeze plug The very next day  on my way to work  coolant came pouring out of the block and the car overheated for the third time  The dealer had the vehicle towed back to the shop and replaced the remainder of the freeze plugs  over the course of the next 2 years  I had the vehicle back to the dealership 2 times complaining that my temperature guage was going up  almost to the red  when I was idling and would go back down when I was crusing  Each time the service manager informed me that he could not duplicate the problem  The Taurus now has 83 000 miles on it  For the past few weeks  I had noticed that it had a slow coolant leak  I took it back to the dealership 2 days ago  Yesterday the service manager called to say that he needed to pull off the power steering pump and the alternator to find the source of the leak  After doing that  he called to say a freeze plug had to be replaced once again  and that Ford would not be paying the bill because my warranty was expired  I agreed to pay  at a reduced labor rate  for the repair  After replacing the freeze plug  he called to inform me that it was still leaking  He said that it was his opinion that I should replace the engine rather than sink any more money into the rusted one  He said he would try to get the Ford factory rep to pay for all but  500 of the repair but that I should call the 1 800 392 ford Customer Service line I called them and spoke with a lady there who informed me that Ford would have paid for the engine up to 75 000 miles  but that since I had 83 000 miles on my vehicle  that Ford would not pay anything  It was my contention  that since I have it documented at the dealership that I was having coolant problems all along that I was not out of warranty at all It is also my contention that my 1996 Taurus was doomed the day they manufactured the engine without treating the block with a rust inhibitor Ford Motor Company had to know that the 1996 Ford Taurus would experience catastrophic problems before 100 000 miles  I will never purchase another Ford product again  and I suggest that anyone reading this follow suit
