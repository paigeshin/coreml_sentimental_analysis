 The Ford Mustang Convertible is fast  good looking  and fun to drive  Corvettes and BMWs are great sports cars too  What if they were the same price  The decision is easy  The Ford Mustang is a clear example of a car that is just too expensive  A Mustang Convertible starts out at  21 000  Of course the real sports enthusiast get leather and all the options  If you can t afford the options  then don t buy the car in the first place  The options are an integral part to the Mustang  ABS  Leather  Spoiler  Power Seats  dual  and the Smokers Package  aka the Cell Phone Package  Doesn t everyone who drives a sports car have a cell phone  They should  Anyway  my point is this  A Mustang starts at 21K  but add tax  warranty  all the options  delivery  and the price gets to  27 500  And this is the price for an LX version  not the GT or Cobra  So I would rather take this money and buy a real sports car that is worth the money  I think the Mustang Convertible should be worth  20 000 for everything  That is reasonable  I find the current cost not reasonable because there are many more prestigious faster cars out there  Why not buy a used Corvette  It will keep its value longer  A Mustang loses 50  of its value after only two years  Or why not buy a brand new BMW  the entry level 300 series for  23 000 base  This will keep its value more and a BMW base model with no options is a lot more luxurious and more prestigious than a Mustang Convertible loaded  whether or not it is a Cobra or GT  It is your choice  But if you want to be noticed  have some prestige  and spend your money smart  Then buy a Corvette used or a new BMW  A Mustang is great  but it is just too expensive br br
