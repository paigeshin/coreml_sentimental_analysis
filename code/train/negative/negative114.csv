 My parents currently own a 98  Ford Contour  the  quot Sport quot  version  My dad says that this car is his biggest mistake he had ever made  I always warned him about those Ford vehicles  where  quot Quality is our  1 Job quot  hah  This car has been recalled four times  now that is  quot Built Ford Tough quot  It has comfort seating for people that are three feet tall  When sitting in the back seat  you find out how flexible you are and how far you can put your legs behind your head  Good ol  Ford engineering put the oil filter right above the exhaust manifold  so where does all that oil drain onto  The exhaust manifold  and does it stink for at least three weeks after changing the oil  YES  Would I take this car if someone paid me to  NO  I think I would pay someone to take it away  My dad does that now cause it won t start  piece of FORD br br
