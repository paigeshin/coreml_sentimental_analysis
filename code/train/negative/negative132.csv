 Well  Here s your lemon story  I bought a 1995 Mustang  V6  new from the dealer  I loved the car  the body style  the interior   everything  At 2000 miles a fuel injector was replaced  At 4000 Ford was replacing my engine  Not to mention the horror story of the dealership wars  After that it was constant   I had an electrical short in the tape deck that no one could ever find  my oil pressure guage didn t work and was replaced  the emergency brake was replaced and the window mechanism was replaced 3 times and I still had problems  Needless to say  the car was eventually bought back and I received a 1998 Mustang V6  I ve had this Mustang for almost 2 years and no problems yet  Definately love the car  Now the only drawback is the snow and ice   mustangs are sleds in the winter br br
