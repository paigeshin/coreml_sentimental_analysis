 Our big search for a larger vehicle started when I found out I was expecting another child  At the time  I was driving an old Volkswagon Bug and I had two children already  We looked at quite a few brands  The only one I didn t feel comfortable with was Ford s  I had heard a lot of negative feedback on those cars  When we saw the Aerostar on the lot  my husband wanted it right then  It was clean and comfortable with a sporty look  I wanted to look a little more  I researched it online to make sure we were getting a good deal  We had looked at  drove  and researched over a dozen before thinking about narrowing down our options  When the dealer lowered his price to what I felt was an awesome deal  we decided to buy it  For not wanting a Ford to begin with  I would have to say that this vehicle has been one of the best we have owned  It is very dependable and comfortable  The air conditioning and heating works well  It even has a windshield wiper on the back window  That is something I never had on any of my previous vehicles  The engine works wonderful  Not a squeak or grind anywhere  Though it is compacted into a small place  I am sure it wouldn t be that hard to fix if something did go wrong  I don t know much about the specifics of the engine  but it will change from car to car  so the specifics aren t as important here as the quality  Recently  we took out the back seat and went shopping for a very large toolbox for my husband s work  I couldn t believe we fit it in there with one of the back seats still in  I guess we don t need a truck after all UPDATED 11 24 00 My mind definitely changed within the 6 months we have owned this vehicle  Within a month  the door started having trouble closing  In about a month after that  the screws started falling out of the door and the panel was loose  The latch to close the door started sticking also about a month ago  The front passenger door has some problems also  The panel started falling out there as well  Though I have a lot of children  we do no more wear and tear on this vehicle than a mini van should be able to stand up to since it is made to carry children  I don t feel we are overly hard on it  Yet  the van keeps falling apart at an unbelievable pace  I will stick with my gut instincts next time and stay away from Ford vehicles br br
