 I bought my Ford Explorer XLT w 5 speed transmission new in 1997  I was primarily interested in the vehicle for its roominess and its 4 wheel capabilities during the winter months  Although I enjoyed the ride for the first few months  I quickly became disappointed with the gas mileage and at 45 000 miles I lost the clutch  900 and I only do highway driving  round trip commute Worcester Boston at 6 00a and 2 00p  I had not lost a clutch in a vehicle since my Volkswagon days back in the  70s  In addition  I am terribly disturbed by the cost of servicing the vehicle at dealerships labor costs have recently jumped to  70 hr  which is absurd  It now costs  500 1000 every time I take the vehicle in to be serviced suffice it to say  my next vehicle will NOT be a Ford Explorer To continue this saga eight months and 25 000 miles later a second clutch has been reported  quot burned quot  out from normal use  My driving habits have not changed from the above  And now the Ford dealership wants another  625 to replace this second clutch Ford will not stand behind its product  so i am dumping this lemon into the laps of the dealership  I have been driving standard transmission vehicles for 30 years and never have I had to replace a clutch in any vehicle with less than 100 000 miles in it  Ford is the worst vehicle experience of my life  They will no longer have my business br br
