 I bought this car used from a dealer for  500  I thought that was an excellent price since the car was in perfect condition  I mean not a dent  scratch  spot on the interior  nothing  The guy said it needed a new head gasket so I thought with a mechanically inclined husband that was great  Well  we bought a gasket kit for  124 and did the job and sure enough the gasket was split  Well  how exciting the car is back together and ready to run for the first time  Won t start  Needs a new converter but that was OK because sometimes that could happen when you blow a gasket because of the antifreeze getting in there  Well  350 there  ready to run  Sounds little rough and doesn t shift properly  Had to fix transmission  gears broken  By doing that job we found broken rear motor mount  axles  cv joints  coolant lines   1672 completes this job  Once again ready to roll remind you I haven t yet got to drive the car  Runs rough and oil light comes on at idle  I need new bearrings and a crank shaft Currently I have only driven the car for little test rides after each job and now the car is sitting for sale in front of my house after  2646 and the cost of insurance and registration  etc  I refuse to do the job because at this I feel that if I do there will only be another problem lurking  All these problems and the car just now hit 100 000  I will never as long as I live  own a FORD car
