 I recently had the opportunity to drive a NEW  less than 1 month old  Ford Explorer XLT  I approached this car with an open mind  I d heard good things  from my mother  the owner of the car in question  as well as bad things   from those who didn t own one  A spring break where I was to be the sole driver of this car should have been the perfect chance to bond with the new car  Right  Wrong At first glance  I liked the Explorer  The paint was nice  console was nice  leather on the seats was nice  room looked nice  When I stepped into the drivers seat for the first time  my good impression of the car began to fade  Due to the make of the seats  in order to have the back at a correct position for driving  the  quot headrest quot   just a continuation of the seat  was so far back that I  seriously  had concerns about major whiplash in the event of a minor fender bender  Despite trying different positions of the seat back  at no point could I get the headrest at a position in which to stop my neck from being whipped back in the littlest of accidents  The bottom of the seat was comfortable  however  which while a plus  didn t make up for the headrests I approached the Explorer thinking of it as an SUV  The front windshield would indicate otherwise  It s about the same size as the windshield on my Chevrolet Prizm  The size of the windshield isn t a great problem  but a fairly large annoyance  Because of the position of the console in reference to the roof  the rearview mirror is literally in the middle of the windshield  which makes viewing small items such as street signs difficult when in the correct position  I ve got to belive there is  some  design that could solve this problem  This car CANNOT take bumps  It is astounding to me that a new Explorer shakes so very much when going over the smallest of bumps  These are bumps that do NOT rattle any other SUV s including the Suburban and Tahoe  When a  95 Suburban takes the same bumps better than a brand new Explorer  I just cringe when thinking about how it will be in 5 years  Going down a fairly bumpy road  Expect to have a horrible headache from your brain being rattled around in your skull  even at speeds as low as 10mph  I really do love going to the gas station daily  Really  I do   especially when the snow is blowing horizontally in my face  SUV s  while known as gas guzzlers  do have standards  The Explorer has a  17  gallon tank  This is the same size as my boyfriends Toyota Supra  which  for those of you who don t know  is a smallish sports car  A 17 gallon tank wouldn t be so bad except when you factor in the mpg  In average city highway use  you get about 14 mpg if you re lucky  This is less than both the Suburban and Tahoe  For a car of this size to have such a small gas tank when the designers are aware of its low gas mileage  it s completely insane I tried to like the Explorer  but in the end  I just couldn t  I belive my first words to my mother were  quot Didn t you research this car before you bought it quot  I will be sticking to my original decision to buy a Chevrolet Tahoe   the Ford Explorer XLT just isn t worth it
