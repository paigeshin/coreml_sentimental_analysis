 I bought this vehicle to have a safe vehicle to transport my three young children on the California freeways My excursion is a 2 wheel drive V10  I have had two major problems with this vehicle 1  The back end of the vehicle bounces from side to side whenever driving over a drain or small pothole in the road  I nearly lost control of the car driving on the 15 freeway at 55MPH  Ford has test driven the vehicle  acknowledged the problem and has refused to take the vehicle back  I think it is because they are nervous about receiving all of their vehicles back  Any 2 wheel drivers experiencing the same problem A test driver from the Dispute Settlement Board has driven the vehicle and another  quot like vehicle quot  and found the same problem  I am hoping that the board rules that Ford take the excursion back 2  All California excursions have a  quot flutter noise quot  that sounds like five holes in the exhaust  This information is in the auto s  quot Technical Service Bulletin quot  available at the dealer of purchase  Ford is aware of this problem and has no answer for it The dealer has informed us that this car really maintains control only when it is filled to capacity with adults and is towing a heavy load  They recommend lowering the tire pressure to below recommended levels  We have had and been extremely satisfied with the Ford Lynx  Sable  Explorer  Bronco and Expedition  I would not AT ALL recommend the excursion to anyone br br
