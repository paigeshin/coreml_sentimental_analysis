 This is in addition to my August 15th Opinion regarding engine problems  which required the replacement of two engines due to head gasket problems I also noted that the transmission was replaced with 32K miles for 2 000 The Ford company wouldn t pay for the replacement eventhough they were aware of a  quot front piston problem quot  common with the Taurus transmissions  I figured that with a new transmission  tires  engine what could go wrong  I found out today  59K miles  that the transmission must be resealed due to numerous leaks eventhough it has only 27K miles on it  It will cost over 600 00  Also have to redo the power steering also due to leaks as well as replacing the front wheel bearings  So far I have spent over 8 000 in maintenance costs to keep the car going and will probably run another 2 000 if I have the work performed  which I doubt  This has been the worst car I have ever owned and anyone who is considering purchasing a ford should get smart and look at other alternatives that have a much better maintenance record br br
