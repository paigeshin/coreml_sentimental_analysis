 We purchased a used 96  Ford Aspire  It looked great  For a small car  it s even roomy  We got the two door  What a mistake  It s family unfriendly if you have small children in car seats  Getting small children in and out of the back is a pure nightmare in the making  You have to actually climb into the back seat to get them out  It s even tough to fit the carseat through the room you have between pushing the seat all the way up  You obviously can t put them in the front because of the air bags  This car is great on mileage  It s about the only plus to it  It s got no get up and go  My 86  Ford Tempo  which is ten years older  has more pick up and go than the Aspire  You can put your foot to the floor on the gas but you ll find yourself saying a prayer when you try to merge on a Freeway that you don t get hit because it takes you forever to reach traffic speed  There are only four seat belts in this car  Unlike most cars  there are only two seat belts in the back  instead of three  Why they didn t put one where there is obvious space for one  is a mystery  I get a work out just driving the car  Power steering my foot  You have to put a little muscle into turning the wheel  The brakes make up for that  They are super touchy  If you aren t very light on the foot  you will get to meet the dash in a sudden fashion  I notice they tend to lock easily  My husband drives this car the most and my older  beat up car is my preference compared  The Aspire might have air conditioning and a better stereo than my old Tempo but having to drive the Aspire just isn t worth the luxury of air and better speakers  This car would be great for a grandmother or your average  run of the mill  Sunday driver  It s slow  Obviously you need to not have small children with this car  It sure isn t child friendly for parents  I thought the hatchback would be nice with children  That was until I tried to fit a standard sized folded playpen into the back  That was difficult  very difficult  but finally accomplished  There is plenty of foot and leg room for such a small car but they sure didn t make the back storage area roomy  The seats do fold down in the back to make more room  That s wonderful unless you have children  In other words  if you need more room in the car to fit something in the back  I suppose you could strap the kids to the top of the car in their car seats  LOL  Although it is a funny image  of course that s not safe or legal  What was Ford thinking when they made this car  Obviously they weren t thinking about families  children  or their needs  I have dubbed the Aspire the new and improved version of the Pinto  I now know why there are so many used Aspires for sale  The original owners got smart and bought something else br br
