 If you get this car  I would suggest getting a cell phone because it is going to leave you stranded  We bought a 92 Aerostar and as you can guess  It literally fell apart  We had to replace the engine  transmission  brake stuff  and many other vital parts  It left us stranded on I 17 200 miles from home with a 4 wheel drive  This means that you need a flatbed tow truck so that the gears didn t get screwed up  Also  The electronics fail all of the time  This means that the windows  radio  ignition  lights  air etc don t work  The car currently has multiple undetectable flaws that leave us wondering if we bought the wrong car  Now  We know  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR  The only thing good about it is the space  Any car company can do that though
