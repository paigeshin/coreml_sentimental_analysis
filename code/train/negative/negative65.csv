 I purchased my Eddie Bauer Expedition three months ago  I compared the Tahoe and Expedition head to head before making my decision  I hate to be a stick in the mud as everyone at Epinions that has rated their Expedition seems to really love them  but I personally think I may have blundered in not buying a Tahoe What initially sold me on the Expedition was the overall cost  My Expedition was about  2000 less than a comparable equipped Tahoe LT  and I purchased it at a time when Ford was offering a great APR on all Expeditions  I secured a loan for 2 9  over 60 months  compared to GM s 7 9  The Ford had more  gadgets  and my kids went nuts over the entertainment system with the flip down TV that came as a free option from Ford on my particular model My Expedition has the 4 6 V 8  I chose the 4 6 over the 5 4 for better fuel economy  or so I thought  The window sticker stated that my vehicle should get 16 City  and 21 Highway  This couldn t be any further from the truth  With numbers like 16   21  I should average about 18 19 MPG overall  right  I average 13 1 MPG  Thinking at first that the problem may be my driving  for a period I drove speed limits only  and attempted to monitor my take off s and such  and my mileage only improved by 1 MPG  This is my main beef with this vehicle  Either I purchased a lemon  or Ford is inappropriately labeling these vehicles  I d like to hear from other Expedition owners to see if their Expedition s had similar gas mileage claims One of my close friends purchased a Chevy Tahoe with a 5 3 V 8  He claims that he is averaging about 18 MPG  I drove a Tahoe with this engine  and it is a powerhouse  Even GM s smaller 4 8 seemed to have a lot more power than Ford s 4 8 If you absolutely love the Expedition and don t care about gas mileage  buy the 5 4 engine  It will get virtually the same mileage as the underpowered 4 6  and will make driving much more pleasurable  P S  If you do purchase an Expedition or if you already own one  think about replacing your factory shocks with a pair of Bilstein Shocks  I did  and they made it handle 100  better  reducing it s rear end bounce and body lean
