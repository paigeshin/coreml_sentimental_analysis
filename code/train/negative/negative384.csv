 First of all I love Fords  I think they are good cars but the 93 Taurus has caused us some trouble  First I bought it about 3 years ago  It has power everything  a good sound system  and a sunroof  But we began to have problems  The 3 8 L Fuel Injected v 6 was a poor engine for a Ford product  We have had problems with both front and rear calibers and the whole brake system  We had to change the rotors  the calibers and of course the pads  But the back brakes were thankfully fixed for free   Car X read the paper wrong  and another problem that they noticed was when the parking brake is set it hangs up on the wheel  So we don t use it seeing it s 300 dollars to fix  But the rotors and all costed 900 to fix  We have also had problems with the starter  changed once  also we have changed the engine once and replaced the motor mounts  The head gaskets broke and air conditioner has stopped blowing cold air   but it hasn t been checked  They were all costly  But other then that I love my Taurus  It has a decent engine with good power and has a smooth ride  The stereo is great and has good bass and the sunroof is good on warm days  The seats our comfortable  with lumbar support  and power everything is good  We also have the keyless entry and the code  I like the Taurus but with all the problems I would stay away from the 93 94 model and get the 96 99 model
