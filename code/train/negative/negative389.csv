 This review is only going to cover the most annoying  quot feature quot  I have ever experienced in a car  I will mention that I love the performance and handling of this car  It s also very roomy and attractive  However  if you want a detailed review of all the aspects of the Ford Taurus  there are plenty of other reviews  just click to the next one in the category This review will simply explain why I will never own one It is my husband s car  provided for him by his company  so neither of us is responsible for choosing this particular vehicle  I have been driving it for a week while he is out of town  I will be more than happy to give it back to him when he returns What is this  quot feature quot  that makes me want to drink gasoline right out of the gas tank  It s a common feature on cars today  the automatic door locking mechanism  When the car reaches 10 MPH  the passenger doors all lock themselves I can see only the slightest  faintest benefit to this  Maybe it will keep your passengers from getting yanked out of the car and mugged and beaten when you pull up to an urban stoplight next to the whores and winos who decorate the corners of your particular hometown  That s the only thing I can think of i b But I do not want a car that decides for me when the doors should be locked i b  You would not believe how often this aggravates me  Any time that I get out of the car and have a need to open one of the passenger doors  I have to remember the extra step of hitting the  quot unlock quot  button   I did not  lock  the door  why should I have to remember to unlock it i  This happens nearly every time I get out of the car because I usually travel with my one year old sidekick who likes to ride in his carseat in the back  In order to get him out  I have to open the back door  Seven times out of ten  I have to  try  to open the back door  then curse and re open the driver door  hit the unlock button  close the driver door and  then  open the back door The gas tank is on the passenger side  So when I m standing over there  filling up  shivering  waiting i ding i  the tank s full  I put the pump away and grab the door handle to open the passenger side door to get my purse so that I can go pay for my gas  Nope  Gotta trot my happy butt around the car  open the driver s side door  hit the unlock button and run back around  or crawl in and reach through to grab my purse Keep in mind  the average temperature is below zero where I live this time of year  The less time that I have to spend dinkering around outside my car messing with locked doors the happier I will be  Not to mention the likelihood of me hitting a patch of ice as I m scurrying back around to the driver s side to unlock the doors and winding up on my bottom So lately  I ve been speaking aloud to this car  and it ain t Christmas carols I m singing when I do  Another annoying  quot feature quot  I have discovered is that the car not only wants to decide when the doors should be locked  but it refuses to shut up about the seat belt  It dings every fifteen seconds if I don t fasten my seat belt  Sometimes I simply do not want to wear it  okay  I m an intelligent grown up  I can calculate risk and make choices for my own personal safety  I do not need the car griping at me about it  This has only forced me to disable this safety feature by fastening the seatbelt and leaving it fastened  sitting on top of it while I drive  Instead of encouraging me to be safe  this car is forcing me to be less safe in protest At the very least  Ford should provide an option for these features  some mechanism to turn them on or off as you desire  I will never buy a Ford Taurus or any other car with these aggressive features  I do not want my car telling me what to do br br
