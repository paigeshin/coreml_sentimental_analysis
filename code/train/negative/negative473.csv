 Okay  perhaps this title is a tad misleading  Actually I ended my ownership of my paid for  Ford Escort  after about a year  This is a good car for some people  but read further to ascertain if in fact it is right for you  or someone you care about b Why did I purchase a Ford Escort  My previous vehicle had seen its last days  I meandered over to the local Ford dealership  While I wanted a car I could depend on  I was also seeking safety and reliability  and wanted a vehicle which was also appealing to the eye  I thought the  Ford Escort  was really cute  and it was reasonably priced  around  12 000 at that time  It is probably around  5 000 at this time  I purchased the  Ford Escort LX 2DR  which is the luxury model of the  Ford Escorts    The purchasing experience  The sales personnel were pretty nice and were helpful  I decided to pay cash for this car  and obtained a three year 36 000 mile warranty  However  we were not pleased when the salespeople and sales manager made us sit there waiting  playing games  for HOURS  They did not make points   Some of the comparable models in the Ford Escort line  2 Dr Hatchback GT 2 Dr Hatchback LX 2 Dr Hatchback LX 4 Dr Hatchback LX 4 Dr Sedan LX 4 Dr wagon The  Ford Escort  is a 4 cylinder of course with a 1 9 liter engine  The car seats 5  though of adults wouldn t be comfortable in the back seat  My  Ford Escort  was turquoise in color  had a c  air bags  am fm stereo  hatchback  cassette   Here are the features and availability from the Ford website  Anti lock brakes  not available Driver and passenger side airbags are standard air conditioning is optional alloy wheels optional cassette optional cruise control is optional There is not a full size spare Leather seats not available luggage rack not available Power brakes are standard on this vehicle Power door locks are optional power seats not available power steering is optional power windows are optional premium stereo not available rear defogger is optional sun and moon roof is optional tilt steering is optional  Here are some of the dimensions for the car noted on the website  Cargo capacity 17 cu Front head room 38 Rear head room 38 Front leg room 42 Rear leg room 35 Exterior Length 170 Width 67 Height 53 Curb weight 2353 Wheelbase 98 Fuel tank capacity 11 9 gallon The mileage for this car is excellent at 30 38 b What I enjoyed about the car  Other than the airbags for short or small people  see below  the car is very safe  This car had absolutely no repairs required in the period of time I owned it  I really appreciated the reliability and dependability  all around driving was fine  The vehicle turned corners well  and I liked the compactness of the car  and the ease in parking because of the small size  It is relatively inexpensive to maintain  I always have to have a cupholder  and this had one in the center console  as well as a change bin  The ignition is illuminated which is a nice feature b What I don t like   What I didn t enjoy about the  Escort  is it has almost no  get up and go  It is powerless  It is not fun to drive  It is not comfortable even in the driver s seat  I have a back problem  and if I drove for more than a half an hour or so I was miserable  The seats are simply not comfortable  as they are very hard  The auto transmission is slow  The driver s side air bag in the 1995 model that I owned was one of the first air bags that came out  This meant that in a slow speed crash it would deploy and anyone  child or short adult  under 5 7  or so  could die  This made me nervous whenever I drove the car  because I am 5 3  If I am going to die in a car crash I would like it to be for a valid reason  like a high speed crash  not because of a poorly thought out  dangerous air bag  The dashboard appeared to be made of plastic  It was poorly constructed  and frankly looked cheap   So  what happened with this car b Even though this car was completely paid for I couldn t wait to get rid of it  due to safety concerns not overall  but due to the airbag problem for small or short people  me  comfort concerns  enjoyment in driving  etc  If you are not short like me  and want an inexpensive  simple  basic economy car I would think the car is acceptable I now have a Saturn SC2  the sporty model  and love it  I feel safer in it  it looks sharp  it is fun to drive  has all the bells and whistles  dings can usually be rubbed out  so the insurance is less expensive b Final wrap up  This is a safe reliable vehicle for most people  If you are short or small or have passengers who are  you may want to really give this some thought  As noted  these airbags were the first out there  so could cause serious injury or death if they were deployed during a slow speed crash  I read this in a few website locations  The motorized seatbelts are a hassle  and the car is very noisy to drive  The seats are hard and terrible for someone with back problems  I did not enjoy this car  other than the cuteness factor  but it is reasonably priced  inexpensive to maintain  minimal repair problems  Obviously others love this car  but for me  I give it a two stars  well okay  two and a half stars  If you decide to purchase this vehicle  be sure to check out the airbag situation  as it could mean the life of you  your child or a small person riding in the vehicle Thanks for reading Suzi
