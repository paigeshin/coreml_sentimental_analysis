 AS a mother of 3  all of whom are still in carseats  the only logical thing to do was to trade in my 200sx for a minivan  As the minivan is only one of a handful of vehicles that have the room my family requires  In addition  We bought a new one so the mechanical difficulties would be minimum I love the fact that the van seats so many people  I never have to worry about bringing 2 cars  Even if I have me kids with me the van seats added passengers  It does so in a roomy way as well I like the way the Windstar handles  It has great acceleration  I like the fact that you are able to see way infront of you while driving  But these features are almost always indicative of all vans  or at least most of them I hate the fact that this vehicle has broken down 4 times leaving myself and my children STRANDED on the side of the road  Each time we brought it back to the dealer where they said they fixed it  Each diagnosis was different  The engine lights continues to go on  to this day  This makes it difficult if not impossible for me to feel safe in the Windstar  Thankfully  my husband is quite mechanical The Windstar handles well  It is easy to steer and control  much like driving a car  Some vans have steering that is difficult The suspension on the Windstar leaves something to be desired  I have the privledge of feeling every bump The brakes are sound  I have yet to have them fail or squeak severly People who should buy this vehicle are those with alot of children or who need to transport alot of things  Anyone who enjoys sports cars   fast vehicles  should avoid this car br br
