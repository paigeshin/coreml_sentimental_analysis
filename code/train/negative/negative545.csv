 Regarding my  soon to be EX Explorer  I can say very little positive about this vehicle  Now that my daughter is away to college  I am finally allowing myself to purchase my mid life vehicle  probably a miata This Explorer has been a nightmare from day one  Besides being somewhat over priced  the repairs on this vehicle alone could have paid for the note for a year  With in my first year I had to have the front suspension re worked  and the brakes adjusted 3 times  Always  it seems  not under the warranty  I dont know if this was the dealers fault  or the vehicle  but even though there were very few miles put on  all repairs seemed to fall under the wear and tear clause of the warranty  In driving this vehicle  I found that cornering was somewhat clumsy  and I was continualy feeling like I would tip over  Gas milage was what you would expect from a suv  it ran close to 15mpg  The carpet in the back pulled up from the edges  even though the biggest thing I would put back there were grocries or luggage There are many other SUV s out there that I am sure are better  but I am tired of them  It is time for something fun
