 Now I can t say everyone will have the exact same experience  but I recently sold my 92  Ford Mustang after it broke down 9 times in less than 6 months  I ve sunk well over twice the cost of what the car s worth into repairs  For the record  I wasn t the one who purchased this car  it was my ex husband s  quot gift quot  I m a mother of two little kids and we ve been broke down and stranded on the side of the road because of this car time and time again  I ve had to replace the battery  alternator  battery connectors  correct a short in the electrical system  the time belt  clutch  two tires  catalytic converter  and something that was wrong with the radiator and exhaust  The car s AC system would have cost over  1 000 to fix after it died out and I didn t even bother to check what the problem was when the heat went  I just got rid of it  To hear this you might think this car went through some rough terrain or was driven a lot  but it wasn t  To school  the grocery store  doctor s visits  and not much more  Now that I m in the purchaser s seat  I m buying a Toyota Camry  I have never had a more unreliable  costly  and problematic vehicle than that Mustang  If you re a young guy or a mechanic who doesn t mind walking or being without a car in spite of the fact that you own a car  then this one s for you  However  if you don t enjoy being stranded and you require reliable transportation then I would suggest your driving something  anything  else br br
