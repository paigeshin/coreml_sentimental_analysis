 I purchased my 1990 Ford Taurus GL Wagon in 1990  So far  I have spent approximately  8 000 on repairs  The main problem with this car is the automatic transmission  it suddenly broke down and had to be rebuilt for the car to be drivable  and that repair cost me around  1 200  There have also been a few recalls on the Taurus  In my opinion  this automobile wasn t built right in the first place  so wether you like it or not  there s going to be a big repair bill about every 3 5 months On the other hand  this is a very strong car  I used it to haul all of my belongings and furniture when I moved from my 2 bedroom apartment into my new house  This car is as strong as an ox  but unfortunately it s not very reliable  If my Taurus didn t break down every once in a while  I would  with no doubt  keep this car for a good twenty years br br
