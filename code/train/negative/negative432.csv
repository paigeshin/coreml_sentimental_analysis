 I test drove this vehicle and I have to say that it was really nice  decked out  and it gave a smooth ride  But  it was very tight for space on the inside  If you usually travel in your car with more than one person other than yourself  I would not recommend this car  Although  If you want something sporty and nice  I would definitely get this car   although everyone else already has one  I would recommend the 2000 Mercury Cougar for everyone  Be sure to check my review on the new 2000 model Mercury Cougar V 6 Sport Coupe  The car is magnificent br br
