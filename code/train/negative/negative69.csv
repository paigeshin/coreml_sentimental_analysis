 We have owned a couple Ford Aerostars  The 1990 model had several flaws  The drivers seat was broken through normal wear and tear  The Anti Lock Break notification light has never worked properly  yet there was never a recall or anything  And the worst aspect of both is that these two and most of these models I have seen  are more apt to rust then other vehicles  They are both have rusted out the bottom side panel between the front and rear tires  The 1988 van has ran fairly well  however the 1990 model has had numerous mechanical problems  Many flaws have resulted from the mini vans  From the alternator not failing to a leaking gas tank  They also have shakey starters in them as well  and a fuel injected engine that will not start without pressing the gas pedal br br
