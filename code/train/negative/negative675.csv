 My Ford Focus ZX3  5 speed manual  though a scant 6 mos  old  is a never ending source of regret  In the ensuing 4 500 miles  the car has been at the dealership for fifteen days  and their alleged  quot fixes quot  never took  The transmission problems remain  even after replacing nearly every major component therein  cluster shaft  input shaft  4 main bearings  And let s not forget to mention the dealer inflicted body damage requiring the repairing and repainting of a front quarter panel  Ford Service Managers  Customer Service Mangers  and Regional Representatives are no help  Too many problems  too many phone calls  too many trips to the dealership  too many meaningless apologies  If my experiences are any indication  anyone who values their hard earned money should steer clear of the Focus  and of Ford  You can bet that in the future  I will br br
