 You know I think back to the nasty car I used to drive and I was happy to get rid of it  I think if you work really hard  you deserve to treat yourself  So at the end of 1999 I bought my mustang  I wasn t too crazy about the new body style at first but I grew to like it  I do have a few complaints however  I owned the car for a month when I started noticing that a rust problem that was beginning on my tail pipe so I made an appointment and brought it in  They replaced the tailpipe  They told me it must have just been a bad part  Then I started noticing that when I turned the wheel the car kinda made a grinding noise and and this humming noise  So yet again I took it in and they told me my car had no power steering fluid in it  How can they sell a brand new car with no power steering fluid  So they filled it up and sent me off  A couple weeks later the rusting started again  I made ANOTHER appointment and brought the car in  This time when I brought it in  I MADE the mechanic get on the ground underneath my car so I could show him the rust  I was starting to think I was think I was going crazy  He told me that my car had more rust on it than a five year old mustang he had just worked on  Luckily this time they were kind enough to give me a loaner since they kept my car for several weeks  I mean I paid for a Mustang and I spent half the time driving a Ford Taurus  If I wanted a family car I would have bought one  Shortly after that I joined the military and my car sat at home for six months and wasn t driven at all  When I came home to my surprise  what was there more of  RUST  I have since had the parts replaced AGAIN  Now the newest problem I have is my alignment  Which after I took it to the dealership I was told that it will never be right because the body was cut wrong   I have no idea what that means Oh and by the way  that humming and grinding  It s starting again a few days ago I m not saying they re all like this but from what I heard it s quite common
