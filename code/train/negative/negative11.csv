  This segment added later It appears as though Ford is FINALLY coming to terms on its SUV line  They admitted that their SUV s were not as safe and environmentally friendly as they should be and will take steps to make them safer for the occupants  other drivers and the environment  Another interesting twist  Ford JUST THIS WEEK decided to reduce production of Excursion by 25  That is not a small percentage  I saw this happening long ago  This is the first step in dropping the line all together  Any guesses on the value of the Excursion you just bought when that happens  Maybe William Ford Jr read my Epinion and decided to take action All I know is there is one more company to add to my DO NOT BUY STOCK list The purpose of Epinions is to post an opinion that may help someone make or not make a purchase  I hope my opinion will prevent someone from purchasing an Excursion  I don t own one  and wouldn t  I m not sure if I d even test drive one  I haven t yet anyway  This shouldn t detract from my view however  For example one need not be a Cuban or Cuban American to have an opinion on Elian and whether he should go home or stay here  Opinions are after all one sided  Some will agree with me  some will not  Personally  I take the stand of I really don t care if you buy an Excursion or not  but if you do buy one take responsibility for what may happen High gas prices  tough  Kill or injure someone in an accident  gt  GO TO JAIL  do not pass go  do not collect  200  Ford shouldn t have built it in the first place  The managers at Ford should have looked a little further than  quot today quot  to analyze buying trends  Especially ones set by Texans  we as a group are statistically not the smartest of the bunch  I just live here  was born in Indiana  Traditionally  all new trucks are tested and marketed in Texas first  Instead of building the biggest on the block  they could have made a different statement  Ford has done this many times and always looses their shorts on it  To this end they should have realized that fuel prices couldn t be cheap forever  infact it should be at least  2 00 a gallon anyway  We ve been spoiled by cheap gas that the automakers don t market fuel efficient vehicles here  but yet you can buy several cars that get 50  mpg in Europe  Even the Suburban  which is still not great  claims to get 18 mpg on the highway much higher than the estimates of around 10 12 the dealers tell of  In the Dallas Fort Worth area  dealers are offering more than  5000 off on them  which means that they aren t selling them  Within 2 years I don t think the Excursion will be built any longer  Excursions don t have to post gas mileage at all  They don t have to even conform with EPA regulations  And by stating that is it a LEV  low emission vehicle  must be a comparison to a coal burning power plant  There is no way you can burn so much fuel and produce as much pollution as a Honda  come on The Excursion s gas mileage doesn t even bother me that much  Heck  not too long ago  I owned a 1974 Cadillac HEARSE  yes it had dead people in it at one time  It only got 7 miles per gallon  I not once complained about it  What irritates me is the people whining about fuel prices who do drive these vehicles  When ever there is something on the news about gas prices there is ALWAYS someone griping but has a big ole truck My BIG issue is the safety issue  Clearly these trucks are dangerous to other cars  The automakers just last month publicly recognized this fact and are making steps to prevent deaths  Why couldn t they have done this earlier  I could care less if a stupid person kills them self  in any vehicle  but when they kill someone else that really bothers me  Especially so when they purchase a vehicle that they are not capable of driving unfortunately this is many times  quot soccer moms quot  They want a sense of security and safety  They have an Excursion full of arguing kids  they have an added distraction of a cell phone and other stuff  Yes  they are completely safe to its occupants  but what about the guy in the Miata she just plowed through  Any vehicle which has to have a bar put under the front and rear bumpers to keep it from  quot monster trucking quot  over smaller cars is inherently not safe to others  no matter what you do One good thing I saw was that there was a guy in California that was charged and convicted of manslaughter for killing someone in an accident because he had a big SUV and a phone and went through a red light and killed someone  Finally a jury that did the right thing br br
