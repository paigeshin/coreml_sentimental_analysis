 Let me start by saying the first time I laid eyes on this car I fell in love with it  The exterior styling was sharp yet not outlandish  The interior was  in my opinion absolutely perfect  I could not imagine the controls being any easier to reach or more intuitive to operate  I especially drooled over the automatic climate controls   Why do more cars not have this feature  Even the shifter knob seemed to fit right into my hand  Though at the time I could not afford it new  I test drove it  the V8 version  and loved the way it picked up and handled  I wanted wanted WANTED this car  A couple years later I totaled the car I did own in a huge snow caused multi car pileup  I needed a replacement immediately  To my great joy I found a  94 T Bird used with only 18k for almost half of the new price  It was the V6 and the color was terrible  but it still seemed like a divine gift of fate  I loved the car for the first couple years I had it  not a single notable problem  Until In 2000 with almost 60k on it  the head gasket blew  Just like the previous review mentioned  it was covered under an extended  pseudo recall  plan because it was such a common problem in the V6 models  To Ford s credit  the motor was replaced completely with no cost to me  AND  with a little coaxing  they actually gave me a loaner to drive for the entire time it took to get the motor there and installed  several weeks  At the time I chalked it up to a bad engineering flaw which they atoned for at their expense  Until 6 months later  the transmission died  I was kinda tight on money at the time  and rather than dropping almost 3 grand to have it completely rebuilt  I opted to replace it with a used one  I realize the risk I took  but I figured it was the best I could do  and took my chances  THEN  in 2002  THAT transmission died on me  I much considered dropping the car right then  but I had JUST paid it off a couple months before and in spite of my better judgement  a part of me still loved that car  A few months passed  and other minor problems popped up  which I attributed to age  including a brake cylinder blow out which luckily happened at parking lot speed and was fixed rather cheaply  and less notably a bushing in the front steering assembly that rotted away due to winter driving and some hard braking on my part  It also started making some noise due to a bad catalytic converter and some undiagnosed squeaky rattle coming from somewhere in the front brakes  The death blow was dealt by yet ANOTHER problem with either the head gasket at close to 60k on the new motor  I thought this problem had been remedied at the time it was replaced  guess I was wrong  or possibly intake gaskets in that vicinity  At this point I have surrendered  The maintenance nightmare has worn away even the most optimistic and forgiving parts of my deep desire to love this monsterous piece of metal  In summary  I did manage to get almost 100k miles out of the car  though I probably sank more money into it than any logical person would  The times when it was running problem free it WAS a dream to drive  and I still hold to the belief that much of the car is of the highest design and ergonomic caliber  But the incidence of MAJOR mechanical problems with the most essential  and expensive  parts of the car are absolutely unforgivable  I have not heard any of these complaints with the V8 version  only with the 3 8L V6  If you have one of these  and you have not yet had problems  not likely 9 years after production  then PLEASE do what you can to either get rid of the car or get it serviced before it self destructs  I really wish that cues could be taken from the interior of this car  and many of the EXCELLENT intuitive features and transferred to other vehicles  but as much as I once loved this car  I cannot recommend anyone to do anything but avoid it like the plague
