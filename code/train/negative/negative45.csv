 This was my first car  unfortunately it s been a huge problem for me  In less than a year  I have already invested at least half it s worth  The first day I drove it over 10 miles it locked up and was unable to drive  My tailpipe and my muffler have fallen off  My mileage has constantly gone done  averaging about 15 miles a gallon  I ve changed the brakes 3 times in less than a year  and they still squeak when I stop  When you are in park  it feels like you are in an earthquake  It rattles  no matter what  The central air is tricky  you have to press off every time you turn off the car or when you turn the air back on it will be on defrost  My right window on the passenger side doesn t even open  The throttle cable hangs up and makes it so sometimes that you can t even make it go over 45 miles an hour unles you re lucky enough to hit that big of a hill  The trunk doesn t open unless you have the car on  The doors stick and you have to repeatedly press unlock to get it to unlock  The scariest thing is that when you drive sometimes the door flies open  No matter where you are  the inter state or a rural road  Even when it s locked  I wouldn t recomend this car  It s too unsafe  Two nice things are the comfy seats   especially when you are waiting for someone  and the roomy trunk  Dependable seekers  look else where br br
