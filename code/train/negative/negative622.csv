 I bought the 1998 Ford Escort Sedan Sport when I moved out of state for law school  Needing a mode of transportation  I opted to buy an inexpensive car to use for the 3 years while I was away at school instead of driving my family car back and forth across the country each term At the time of my purchase  the economy was still strong and not many car dealers in Southern California were willing to sell their cars at a discount price  Mitsubishi wanted  16K for their Mirage  Toyota wanted  17K for a Corolla  Honda wanted  16K for a Civic and even Chevrolet wanted  16K for a Prism  It was insane  I definitely did not want to spend more than  15K for a  point A to point B  car  So finally  I saw a brand new 1998 Escort Sedan Sport on  sale  at the local Ford dealer for a little less than  15K Anyway  the first month of driving my car  I thought that there was something wrong with the car  In Southern California  there is a LOT of highway driving  even for short distances  I was having problems accelerating onto the freeway it took me a good minute or two to go from 0 to 60  It was ridiculous  I took the car in and they did a tune up on the car and could not find anything wrong  Apparently the car s acceleration just sucks  Period  There is nothing  Sport  about this car  110 hp  It felt more like 70  My old 90 hp 1985 Oldsmobile Firenza had more pep than this car  I think the 2 door ZX2 s have a better engine and has more pep  but the sedan is very sluggish And being in warm temperatures  if you turn on the air conditioning while the car is climbing uphill forget it  Your car will actually decelerate even with your foot pressing the gas pedal all the way to the floor  Also  if you have 4 adults in the car  forget about trying to accelerate at any good pace  The car will basically be maxed out at about 60 mph without making horrible noises and shaking  even though the speed limit in CA is 65 After about a year of owning this car  the power window started sticking  That had to be replaced  but it was under warranty  Then a few months later  a fan in the air conditioning unit broke and was also replaced under warranty  Also you can t upgrade the stereo on this car unless you buy an expensive adapter harness kit because the stereo is integrated into their heating cooling controls  Who designed this thing All I have to say is that I was very happy when I graduated law school and sold this car  I had it listed in the paper and auto trader for WEEKS before it sold for a couple thousand below blue book
