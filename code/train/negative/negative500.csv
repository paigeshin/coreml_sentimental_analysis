 My father in law bought this car new in Nov  1993  It has the 3 8l v6  I don t have to tell you about the 3 8l Ford V6 From the beginning he had problems with the electrical system  Ford repaired the tail light assembly  The tachometer went out at 1 year  Needed brakes at 2 years   14 000 miles  Master cylinder and calipers at 20 000 miles   3 years  My wife inherited it in 1996  At that time we had a 1994 t bird that I loved  It had the V8 motor and was a blast to drive  Very reliable  Any way  at 35 000 miles the brakes went out again  One winter morning the temperature dropped to  5 degrees  When my wife started the car the left turn signal came on all by itself  the right side window kept going up and down all by itself  the horn started blowing and the head lights started flashing between high and low beam and then off  This car has a mind of it s own  At 50 000 miles I was in a parking lot and started to back out and brushed up against a guard rail and the whole front bumper assembly came off  Cost   1500 00  Both door panels are falling apart  The drive side door hinges broke and had to be replaced  Now the hinges on the passenger side need replacing  At 63 000 miles it had a blown head gasket  Cost   2500 00  The car has 64 000 miles on it now and last night my wife pulled out into traffic and the car stalled  She almost had a wreck  Some wonderful people pushed it off the road for her and that is where it is now  Going to have it towed to a junk yard today and buy a Dodge Intrepid DO NOT BUY THIS CAR UNLESS YOU ARE A VERY RICH PERSON THAT WANTS TO THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY br br
