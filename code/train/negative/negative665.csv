 My current  and definitive  impression about the Focus was by renting it while my VW Jetta VR6 needed some repair  While they were doing the forms at Enterprise  I ve seen a Focus just being parked and I immediately remembered that this was one of my choices for buying a new car  I was very preoccupied at that time  I asked to have it and I did  The first reaction somebody must have seating for the first time in driver s seat should be  how could this car have such a cheap small interior  while looking spacious from outside  The only answer to this is for me is its poor design  which suggests a waste of space and volume  Why having a huge trunk when the passengers in the back seats are staying with the knees at their mouths  This car is definitely too raised from its back  forcing the driver to see the road like being on a horseback  Due to this  the rear view is limited  not talking about turning you head for changing lanes on a highway  you wont see much  so pay attention to the traffic ahead The second feedback comes immediately after the engine starts  you have to speak louder than in the previous car you drove  Its engine is very noisy and struggles each time you ask for more than riding on a 35 miles restricted road   avoid climbing hills  must be a warning in the owner s manual  Lets assume you finally drive at full speed but Orange County s traffic  like usually  stops sudden  I can bet you ll be asking yourself if the car will come at full stop before touching the Lexus is front of you And at last  it has a feature that is rather a bug  the automatic switches from D rive  to N eutral  without pushing the unlock button  and fairly easy  If you would drive with 65 miles on highway and accidentally you ll push it  don t be surprised to be hit from the back  there were no brake lights to warn for sudden drop of speed  I didn t mean to compare a beauty like VW with the Focus  because they cannot be even associated  It was for me just another reason to appreciate the German engineering and the serious way in which they understand to build vehicles  the Jetta was  and continues to be a wonder to me  that never stops amazing its driver  I just asked myself how a  car  like Ford Focus could be manufactured in the year 2000  And when I am thinking that I had for a while the idea to pay money for it
