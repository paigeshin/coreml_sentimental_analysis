 Entering this vehicle without a key is easy  On some models  keyless entry systems are in use  This consists of a number pad on the driver door  The owner simply punches a combination to enter the vehicle   quot What s so bad about that quot  you say  Well the problem is this  If the correct combination is entered by itself or within ANY STRING OF NUMBERS  the door unlocks  A thief could find one of these vehicles in a dark parking lot and just sit next to it and punch random numbers untill the door opens  There is no time delay  and no maximum number of tries  I tried this myself  and was able to enter the vehicle after about 3 minutes of random number punching  Also  a permanant  quot backup quot  code is in the system in case you forget your personal code  This cuts the time it takes to punch the correct random number considerably  I would strongly caution anyone buying this vehicle to inquire with the car dealer as to whether or not this problem has been fixed on new models  As for those who already own one  I would consider disabling the keyless entry system br br
