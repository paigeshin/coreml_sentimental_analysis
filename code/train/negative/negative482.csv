 After many years of driving a 3 door minivan  with three kids my husband and I decided go for something more practical  We both like the look of the Expedition and the fact that it has the third seat  We got to the dealership and we gung ho and ready to buy  I took it for a spin while my husband conversed with the salesman  upon my return and to the dismay of the salesman I told my husband no way  After he drove the Expedition he also agreed  We were reluctant to reject this vehicle because until you drive it   its great  The interior is well designed and comfortable but the positive aspects of the vehicle are mostly aesthetic  The truck feels narrow and  quot pigeon toed quot  while driving  rendering it a poor handling truck  The suspension feels too bouncy making the truck feel as though it were all over the road so to speak  especially over bumps  I drove the truck for about 45 minutes  and my husband the same  so in total we drove for an hour and a half and were unfortunately not at all impressed br br
