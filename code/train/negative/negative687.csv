 Our families have always bought Ford cars and trucks  We have always been treated good until now  My husband and I love this car  We bought this car in October 1999  However  after having the car for a month we were in a car accident  We took the car to be repaired in Dec  1999  Ten weeks after turning in the car in for repair  Ford is still not releasing the parts to repair the car  How can they sell a brand new car but not have the parts available to repair it  This makes no sense to me  We will never buy another FORD again especially after the way we have been treated  Poor customer service br br
