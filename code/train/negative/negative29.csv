 As I was driving off the lot in my 2002 Ford Explorer  I thought for what I just paid  nothing could be better  I loved everything about it  and drove it everywhere just to be driving it  A few days later  I drove to meet my family  and saw another 2002 Explorer parked in the yard  turns out my sister had just bought her one  and we will get to hers later  First let me explain that I drive 1 hour to work  and then 1 hour back  When I want to go shopping or to the movies  that is another hour  So I put a lot of miles on my car  THE GOOD This car has awesome bright lights  comfortable seats  easy access  and I love the two power outlets  Great for a crowd with cell phones  THE BAD Not long after I got it  the sprayer on the back window didnt work  and soon after that the back window wouldnt stay open  One day  as I was pulling out into traffic  the transmission slipped  and I was nearly hit my oncoming traffic  and that lasted for about 2 months  Oh yea  it probably took about three days when the plastic around the seat broke  At one time  when my friend was in the back  we had the biggest laugh because she couldnt get out because the door was stuck  I didnt think it was too funny  since it has done that since  you just have to shove your body up against it to get it open  Just the other day  when I would try to put the car in park  it would stop between the R and P  You have to take it down and then shove it back up  not problem once you get used to it  Even though  I never used the luggage rack  the paint came off of it  and still ford is being VERY slow about replacing it NOW THE SISTER S EXPLORER When she drove hers  she loved it too  Funny thing is  she loved it until about three weeks ago  when She  Her Husband  her daughter  and me  and my two kids  We had driven up to San Antonio in two cars  and were coming back in one  Her Explorer didn t have the third seat  so that left us with one person without a seat  As we were leaving San Antonio  there is a red light on the bottom of a hill  and as we were coming over the hill  we had to slam on the brakes and swerve to miss a car  Well twice the Explorer went on two wheels  and just as he almost got it under control  we slammed into a rock wall  and them spun around in an ending position of the back of the Explorer against the rock wall  Everyone in the front seat was ok  just sore from the airbags  everyone in the back seat was ok  except for the 8 in cut from the center consol  and the seat belt marks  and for me  the idiot who rode in the back of the car  with no seat  was thrown from the back glass  and surprisingly  ok  The Explorer held up  but was impossible to control  which given the facts that he just slammed on the breaks and got over  not really jerking that hard  the car was not safe My Recommendation is to not buy the Explorer  unless you are a gambling person UPDATE  Now the back left window doesnt roll down  AND I am over warranty  AND the plastic on the back glass is cracking  AND when I drive through holes   there is this horrible sweaking noise
