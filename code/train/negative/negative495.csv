 I was recently married  My husband and I decided we should buy a car  After much consideration and various test drives  we decided against the Ford Ranger and went with the 2001 Ford Focus  my theory being  where would we put the kids in a truck  This was my first mistake The car was awesome  We had a great time bombing around in our brand new car and decided to take it on a road trip when I drove him back to California where he works  I was to stay in California for a few weeks then return back to Toronto While down here  I was in an accident  I was rear ended by some punk kid  The damage was minimal to my untrained eye so I figured that it would be in the shop for a couple of weeks and then I would have my car back  This was six weeks ago  What is the deal you ask  Well let me tell you Ford puts out manuals of car parts  Little pictures with all the parts drawn neatly in a little square  and then a list of all the parts you would need to fix the car  Unfortuantely  someone  somewhere was slacking on the job or was too high to realise what he was drawing and perhaps turned to drawing little doodles instead of the parts  The result of this is the one part stopping my car from being on the road does not exist  It is not on the parts list  nor in the diagram of little pictures  So what does this mean for me  This means endless hours on the phone to my insurance company  Ford Customer Service  who  by the way  assure me that there will be an internal investigation  the Body Shop who is fixing my car  who are actually a Ford Dealership Body Shop  and my parents  trying to figure out a way to get my vehicle and get me home  Rental bills so I do not have to be stuck sitting here with no car  are piling up and although my insurance company is reimbursing me  that does nothing for me now Apparently this is not the only problem they have had  Seatbelts  transmissions  seats  panels etc have all taken between 2 weeks and 6 months to arrive at various body shops in North America  leaving you  the proud Ford automobile owner  stranded This has been one of the worst experiences of my life and I dread even thinking about what would happen if I were to be in another car accident with this vehicle
