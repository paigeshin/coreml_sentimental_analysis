 Previously having owned a 1997 V8 Explorer Limited  I was anxious to get into a 2003 Explorer as my rental while my Supra was getting more than a month s worth of repairs  How did I like my new transportation for the next couple of months  Other than having a lot more space than my sports car  it was an overall terrible experience POSITIVES  Before we dive into the bad stuff  let s start with the stuff that I like 1  EXTERIOR APPEARANCE  When you look at this car from the outside  it looks very grand  beautiful  and much nicer than the previous Explorer  It combines the more classic looks of the original Explorer with the more radically curvaceous looks of the model before this one  It looks more like an SUV than a soccer mom vehicle  or a glorified station wagon  It s very nice looking on the outside 2  INTERIOR APPEARANCE  Ford did make an attempt to stay with the times and add some strange trim to it  It looks like a silly silvery fake carbon fiber trim on the dash and doors       but for some reason  I like the way it mixed with my silver Explorer  and the dark grey interior  It was a nice package 3  INTERIOR SPACE  Immediately you notice this is MUCH larger than the previous Explorers  Not only can you pop up a third row of seats  albeit not as roomy as the middle row  but you can fold down everything in the back to carry large items  I relocated a 30 gallon aquarium  twin sized mattress and desk  many rounds of friends  stuff from apartments during college semester moving times  etc  It really did have a lot of space  much more than I was accustomed to with the 1997 Explorer  Good improvement NEGATIVES  The above really just sums it up for the new Explorer s positives  now       let s go on with the negatives  This will be an easier and longer list to make 1  FLAWED SEATBELT WARNING SYSTEM  In an attempt to encourage drivers to wear their seatbelt all the time  Ford came up with a seemingly good system       after you start driving  if you do not have a seatbelt on       you will hear a very loud and audible alert for about 10 to 15 seconds  This reminded me many times to put my seatbelt on  Why is it flawed  Let s say you wanted to quickly pull from your parking spot to your apartment complex mailbox and run in there for a second  You park  you put your car in Park  and you walk in while your girlfriend waits for you       while the car is in park  this seatbelt warning continues to beep and repeat every 20 or 30 seconds  for about 10 to 15 seconds       also  if you put your seatbelt on immediately once you hear the sound  you get to continue to hear the warning sign for the duration of its time  Ford engineers should ve caused this to automatically disable when the car is in park  and turn off when the seatbelt plugs in  Their mistake  Maybe it will be corrected in the future  but it is not for the 2003 s  We ll just call it  Good Game  try again  since this feature can be disabled  and maybe they can correct it in the future or make a recall 2  SEATS  The cloth seats have a bad habit of bunching up and catching your clothes  not to mention if you make a relatively sharp turn  without any bucket like characteristics       you will slide the opposite way of your turn  whether it be into the center or the door   3  COUNTER INTUITIVE LOCKS  I can t tell you how many times I had to unlock the doors  cause all the passengers in the car couldn t figure out which way the door locks work  It is the exact opposite of what you expect  Maybe check this out next time you see one  and you will know what I am talking about  It s a switch you push or pull  with no red indicator  and it s kind of a half button thing       it s terrible design 4  ENGINE  The engine is terrible       I sometimes wonder if there is anything slower on the road  I see a Ford Festiva or a Chevy Metro across the light  and I am thinking   There is no way that can be slower than this thing  It takes me a good long time to get to 60 mph  Also  if you are a speed demon and should drive at high speeds  once you hit the 107 mph speed limiter  instead of limiting you gently at that speed  it violently cuts fuel jerking the car dangerously slower in a sudden manner  and very roughly  Of course  you may not have enough time or road to get going this fast       since it is so slow 5  OFF ROAD CAPABILITY  Although it looks capable  the 2WD version certainly is not  I can t speak for the 4WD or AWD versions  but the 2WD V6 is anything but       it s just a jacked up  roomy station wagon   P 6  FUEL ECONOMY  You can expect below 20 mpg  if not right at 20 mpg on the highway  and closer to 15 mpg in the city during regular driving  even with this small engine  The EPA window sticker fuel economy rating for this is 16 21  and seems to be pretty close  In a foreign SUV  even with more weight and power  you can get better fuel economy 7  AIR CONDITIONING  Not only is this air conditioner unbearably loud       in fact  so unbearably loud that when up all the way in the front and the back       you can t hear anyone who is not within a few inches of your ear  Makes conversation tough  if not impossible       this unit also takes a long time to cool down in Texas heat  which may sound normal  but it takes much longer than older cars I have driven  Once you have driven for a while  the unit gets extraordinarily cold  though  but it s very temperamental 8  CHEAP TRIM  The outside trim is extraordinarily cheap  Someone closed the rear door relatively hard  and the trim started coming loose  the rental car company said this was normal with their Explorer       and noted it on the damage before I took the car 9  STEREO  The stereo was terrible  if you turn volume up at all       it starts to crackle and mumble together  This did succeed  however  in breaking my habit of listening to loud music       since at loud volume levels  it doesn t sound like music anymore in the Explorer  Also  when you forward or rewind  it sounds like it is forwarding rewinding fast at first       although it seems to be going at the exact same 1x play rate and just jumbling up the sound  It takes a solid 5 to 10 seconds to increase the rate of forward rewind  but spends too long doing so       making this a very useless feature  and much more useless than it otherwise could have been 10  HORN PLACEMENT  This may seem like a small thing  but usually when someone is in need of using the horn       they are in a high stress tension situation  often reacting to an emergency  In this car  you have to remove your hand from the perimeter of the wheel and push on the inside of the wheel  The horn is not accessible with the thumbs in anyway while holding on to the steering wheel  Other car manufacturers think of these little ergonomic issues  while Ford apparently does not 11  BRAKING  The brakes fade very quickly  and if they did this while I was not towing anything       I can only imagine how dangerous and amplified this would be if I were towing a boat      The handling in this car is what I would expect out of an SUV       although it feels less prone to roll over than the 1997 version of the car  it certainly feels as if it is going to roll after each curve       maybe this is because of the news attention Explorers have recently gotten about rollovers and me just psyching myself out       but  it is definately not a handling machine Ride quality is moderate on smooth road  but still has quite a bit of road noise       however  a bump will send you flying higher than you expect I believe that sums it up  although I may have mixed up a few things       but I believe this car is not worth the money  at all       and priced into it is the hype that has come with the Explorer since it became the best selling SUV a number of years ago  I would look to Chevrolet or a foreign manufacturer for a better built SUV       you can even get a lightly used Mercedes ML320  which will probably be more reliable  for less than this vehicle  and although that is not a perfect vehicle       it is far better value than this one Best of luck  and I hope I have been helpful  and I hope I didn t upset any owners of this vehicle       best wishes on your automotive search
