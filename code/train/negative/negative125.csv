 The Mach 1 is back for the  03 model year after an almost 25 year absence in the Mustang lineup  Even though the original Mach 1 looks almost nothing like the new version  visually only sharing a shaker hood scoop  spoiler  and Mach 1 logos  they certainly have one major attribute in common  outright performance  Like the original  the 2003 version is designed for speed versus touring  many luxury items that would have added weight i e  heated seats  an optional navigation system  a sunroof  etc  are not offered in the Mach 1  In the end the Mach 1 is approximately 100 lbs lighter than a GT Coupe  The Ford Mustang has always thrived on its amazing power per dollar ratio  this is definitely the case with the 2003 Mach 1  For the 03 model year the Mach 1 is only available with Ford s DOHC 4 6 V8  basically the same engine that powered the  99 01 Mustang Cobra s  This engine pumps out 305 horsepower  45 more ponies than the SOHC V8 powered GT  thus making the Mach 1 one of the most powerful cars on sale in the U S south of 30 grand  Keeping in tune with performance purposes  a convertible which would have added performance hampering weight  is not on the list this year  a 2 door coupe is the only body style available with the Mach 1 trim b Note b  A 5 speed manual is standard  a 4 speed fully automatic transmission is available at  815   Driving Impressions b Like the original Mach 1  the 2003 version is fast  The  03 Mach 1 makes it clearly known by its superior throttle response and its burbly exhaust note at both startup and under full throttle that it s not just a stripped down version of the Mustang GT trim levels  If you own a  99 03 Mustang GT don t expect the Mach 1 to be loads faster  though there is definitely a noticeable difference in standing start acceleration b Note b  Traction control comes as standard equipment A few magazines report the 0 60 time of the Mach 1 to be as low as 5 2 seconds  which is only a shade faster than the GT  however the Mach 1 provides the driver with much more of a  throw you back in your seat   feeling than the GT  The 5 speed manual coupled to this DOHC V8 engine makes a great combo  The only major gripe I have here are the throws of the aluminum shifter  they are far too long for quick shifting  The 03 Mach 1 s shifter offers throws that are more reminiscent of a 1987 Ford Escort s manual shifter than a post  2000 performance car s 5 speed manual shifter  So does the hood scoop really shake at idle like the original  Hardly  Ford calls it a shaker hood  though if you don t have 20 20 vision you will be hard pressed to see it move  The shaker hood scoop for the  03 model year is more  cute  than  intimidating   as it once was back in 1969 i Cruising  through town or on the freeway is not the smoothest event  although by far surpasses the ride quality of the current generation Mustang s predecessor  Rattles and odd noises are still an issue with the Mustang  however it seems as though with each passing year the Mustang s ability to keep the driver in a rattle free environment while cruising gets slightly better  If you don t like the sound of your exhaust rumbling every second you are in your car then you might want to take a pass on the Mach 1  From idle  to redline  to just cruising at 65 MPH in 5th gear  the exhaust and engine rumble can be clearly heard in the cabin at almost all times  This is one of the Mach 1 s best features to most of the Mustang cult following  though I suspect many naive consumers will be overwhelmed by the decibel level in the cabin  The Mach 1 s robust engine exhaust note is unquestionably a case of  you either love it or hate it  Unlike many cars on the road that can claim close to the same 0 60 and 1 4 times as the Mach 1  the Mach 1 exhibits some of the best passing power since the late V8 Camaro s  Thanks to a decent amount of torque at a relatively low RPM  the Mach 1 never  needs  to be downshifted while cruising at freeway speeds to accomplish quick passing maneuvers  The same excellent power in top gear is also beneficial for extreme hill climbing  The Mach 1 accomplished every hill I put it up against  up to 6  grades  with no need to downshift  in fact the Mach 1 was more than happy to accelerate up these inclines in 5th gear  It seems as though downshifting into 4th to accomplish these types of road conditions just made for unnecessary engine noise  I have never been overly fond of driving the Mustangs on the twisties  Despite the grip offered from the big 245 Z rated 17  tires and the upgraded suspension  the Mach 1 still feels big around turns  Unlike the original  however  the  03 Mustang Mach 1 is acceptable on these types of roads  The original Mach 1 was almost scary to drive on twisty back roads  Not only did the original require huge arms to turn the vehicle at high speeds  but the tires also seemed to howl at every sharp bend  not the case with the  03 Mach 1   Braking  is excellent  With the 4 wheel disc brakes coupled with 4 wheel ABS I did not have a problem stopping this vehicle from 70 MPH to a stop  something an owner of the original Mach 1 could only dream of   Fuel economy  is acceptable  The Mach 1 is rated at 17 25 which gives it about the same EPA rating as most of the V8 powered Mustangs from 1979 2003 and most sport oriented cars on the market  One should note that the EPA rating of the Mustang is sort of a laughingstock among V8 powered Mustang owners  I have never talked to a Mustang owner who has received over 25 MPG  my late  98 Mustang GT averaged about 22 MPG  most owners whom I have talked with average between 18 21 MPG highway  An added problem in this department is that the 03 Mach 1 requires premium fuel  the GT can run off of regular  With gas prices reaching  2 10 in many areas of the world  just for regular  another   20 cents per gallon for premium is really going to put a hamper on your pocket book  The other downfall here is the small fuel tank  At only 15 7 gallons  your local gas stations will most likely be your new hangout   Interior b The interior is where my major gripes lie  To start  the instrument cluster gauges are absolutely tiny  These instruments are some of the smallest I have ever seen in an automobile produced by FOMOCO  Why Ford thought that the muscle car enthusiast would want tiny gauges is beyond me  Ford obviously is not catering to enthusiasts with less than perfect vision  The plastics throughout the cabin also feel overly cheap  From the plastic gadgetry  to the door panels  most surfaces feel like they were taken from an era where interior quality was an afterthought  One of my concerns  something I rarely mention in a review  is the sound of the frameless doors when they shut  they sound like they were put together with plastic and glue  I have not heard doors sound this poor in quality while closing since the 1st generation Dodge Neon s rolled off the assembly line   On to some positive notes   Ergonomics are excellent  As with all Mustangs I have driven  all the gadgetry in the Mach 1 is logically placed and easy to use  The leather seats are also a fine asset  These seats are both extremely comfortable and supportive  good bolstering in both the upper and lower portions of the seats  The premium seats found in the Mach 1 are completely different from the less desirable leather seats found in the GT or the V6 powered trim levels  Both the driver and front passenger seats offer manual adjustments  8 way driver  4 way passenger  Rear seating is unfortunately made of a cheaper type leather  This leather visually matches the more expensive front leather seats  however there is a definite difference in the texture and quality of the rear seating surfaces  As mentioned  the 2003 Mach 1  is not  loaded to the brim with embellishments  though the Mach 1 does come standard with enough equipment to satisfy most consumers looking for a car in this particular market  Some standard amenities on the Mach 1 include dual front air bags  a decent sounding Mach 460 AM FM 6 disc in dash CD system with 8 speakers  AC  power door locks  windows  titanium pedals  1 cup holder  two 12 volt power outlets  cruise control  etc  Since the Mach 1 is basically a package in itself there are not too many options beyond the standard equipment  In fact  other than the optional automatic transmission  815  the only other optional package that will cost you money is the interior upgrade package  445  This interior upgrade package gives you stainless steel pedals  an aluminum shift knob  and chrome accents  For more info on standard and optional equipment you can visit  www ford com  The Mustang Mach 1 might look like a roomy coupe  though it is anything but  The Ford Mustang remains one of the tightest fits next to the late Camaro Coupe  Up front  the driver and front passenger should have enough room  Being 5 6  and my passenger 6 1  we both had enough room to stretch our legs and necks  The rear  however  is a different story  Not only is leg room next to none  but head room is also limited  Having owned a 1998 GT nothing has changed  for the better  in this department over the years  For future reference  the redesigned  05 models are said to have a much roomier back seat b Note b  The Mustang Mach 1 can seat up to 4 adults Stowage space is actually not as bad as some people might think  With the rear 50 50 seats folded completely down  the Mustang Mach 1 can easily hold 2 weeks worth of groceries  My  98 GT  which was equally as roomy  enabled me to haul around new computers  huge vacuum cleaner boxes  etc  etc  with no problem  One should note that even though the Mustang does come with a glove box  it will probably only fit a few parking tickets b Exterior b  The Mach 1 is definitely a good looking muscle car and by far looks the most aggressive out of the Mustang lineup  including the Cobra  The major head turning feature of the Mach 1 is the raised hood with shaker scoop resting at the top  The Mach 1 also comes with an air dam  larger tires with very attractive 5 spoke Heritage chrome wheels  spoiler  and large Mach 1 logos to help segregate this car from its less powerful siblings  If a Mustang Mach 1 is a must on your shopping list  I highly suggest checking out a Mach 1 dressed up in black paint  Models that are painted  black  do not carry a painted racing stripe which  in my opinion  makes this Stang appear more tacky than aggressive b Price  Warranty b There is definitely one thing about the Mach 1 that you can count on  a relatively low price  With only 2 options available  the Mustang Mach 1 tops out at just under  30 000  about  9 000 less than the Mustang Cobra  and about  3 000 more than a fully loaded GT 2 door coupe  If anything happens to your Mustang Mach 1  Ford unfortunately offers one of the  worst  standard warranties on the market  a 3 year 36 000 mile bumper bumper warranty  An extended warranty can be purchased at an extra cost   Final Thoughts b I do like the Mustang Mach 1  though I do not recommend it for a few reasons  most notably due to the tawdry interior  Ford desperately needs to updated the interior with richer materials  increase the standard warranty by at least a few years and another 12 000 miles  and give this car a better shifter  I do  however  recommend the Mach 1 over the GT trim levels  Even though acceleration may not be that much better than the GT  which is already great  the Mach 1 is much more comfortable and will undoubtedly be a collectors car in the future  I definitely forecast much better resale value with the Mach 1 over the GT Willing to sacrifice a few seconds off your 0 60 time and the backseat of the Mach 1 for a more refined sports car  You may want to check out    a href content 87909764740  my review on the Nissan 350Z a     Thanks for reading
