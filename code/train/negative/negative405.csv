 I personally do not own this vehicle  but my in laws do  After listening to all the complaints about this truck that my in laws have  I felt compelled to write an Epinion about it  My in laws do not reside in any one State  they are constantly travelling  so they accumulate  many  miles on their vehicles  Keep in mind that this truck has not been in the shop only in Utah  but in several states  sometimes more than once in the same State  The following review will be based on my father in laws opinions and experience with his  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat   written in question and answer form DnDn4kidz   quot Why did you purchase this particular truck  the Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  Father In Law FIL from here on out   quot We bought the Ford because it was the only truck that met all the specifications we were looking for  including full size rear doors  We ve never had any trouble with any of the other Ford vehicles we ve ever owned  and figured we would not have any problems with the  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  quot DnDn4kidz   quot What do you like about this truck  and what do you not like quot this list will be long lt g gt FIL   quot We like everything about this truck  except the mechanical failures we have experienced  We like the looks  the comfort  and every other aspect  The mechanical failures we have experienced have considerably overwhelmed the details we like about this truck quot DnDn4kidz quot What have been the problems with the Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  quot FIL quot Where do you want to start Hehe Within the first 1000 miles we drove this truck  the transmission and the after cooler on the turbo failed  Within the first 15 000 miles the steering box and the brakes failed  losing complete control of the truck  The torque converter in the transmission broke within 20 000 miles  The transmission failed and the torque converter failed again  a second time after  Ford   fixed  them  Several times we have lost all the gauges  which are electronic  to include fuel gauge  speedometer  tachometer  overdrive on transmission fails  etc  If you lose the power steering fluid  like when the steering box broke  you can no longer steer   nor  stop the truck  because the fluid is all in one column  We continue to experience these same problems over and over quot DnDn4kidz quot What does the dealership do about these problems quot FIL quot The dealership in Utah where the truck was purchased  continues to fix the problems within a timely manner  but the problems continue to occur  But  for  43 000 you would expect to be purchasing a vehicle that did not  need  to be in the shop every other week or so it seems quot DnDn4kidz quot Why don t you turn it back in as a  lemon quot FIL quot The  law  in Utah states that a vehicle can not be considered a lemon until the same problem has occurred at least four times within 12 months  or unless it has numerous safety failures  The next time one of these problems occur with our truck  we will be able to turn it in as a lemon  If we have one more major problem with this truck  we re turning it in and buying a Chevy quot DnDn4kidz quot Aside from all the mechanical failures  how comfortable is this truck to ride in quot FIL quot Well  it would be a lot more comfortable if we weren t constantly worrying about something breaking  The front and back seats are all extremely comfortable  There is plenty of leg room for short or tall passengers  and plenty of head room quot DnDn4kidz quot Aside from the constant worry of something breaking  how is driving this truck  Could someone such as myself  who has never driven a big truck only my bus van lt g gt  drive this truck quot My FIL is  not  much taller than myself  so if he can drive it  I m sure I could hehe FIL quot Oh  it s easy to drive  When everything is functioning properly  it s an excellent vehicle to drive  It takes a barnyard to turn it around in  because it s a huge truck  but you have to expect needing a lot of area to turn such a large vehicle in quot DnDn4kidz quot How does it tow quot My in laws own tow a trailer FIL quot It tows it s maximum allowed towing rate with no problems or lug on the engine  With the size  towing capacity  and deisel engine it can tow about anything you would want to tow quot DnDn4kidz quot Would you recommend the  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  to anyone  if so  who quot FIL quot I would recommend this particular truck to my brother in law hehe but nobody I actually like  I would recommend another Ford truck similar to this one  but not this particular one  We would even purchase another  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  and try our luck with it  but we think  this one  that we got is a lemon  and someone on the manufacturing line had to have been on drugs  We know several people who own  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat   who have not had any problems with thier truck  we just got  lucky quot Personally  I do not know what any of the following  specs  mean  but based on the above  interview  with my father in law  it sounds like over all this would be a good truck  that he would highly recommend  but just not the one they got stuck with  The  recommend to potential buyers  is a yes  and  no response  He would recommend this truck  but beware  you may get stuck with a  lemon
