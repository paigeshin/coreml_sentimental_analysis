 I always wanted a truck  especially after owning a little ol  station wagon for many years  I wanted to go big  but could only afford small  and ended up with a 90 Ford Ranger 4x4 XLT  At the time of purchase  and for the next few years  it was the greatest truck in the world  Got me where I needed to go  and took everything else with it  The extended cab was perfect to toss bags or anything else in  and also housed a little bazooka tube for some extra thump when I wanted to turn the music up The V6 Engine gave me a nice ride  though it was a bit underpowered  compared to what I drive now  And it turned out to be this engine that would cause me all the pain and suffering in the world a truck can cause you  It started innocently enough when my car suddenly overheated and stopped in the middle of the freeway one day  Pushing my car into the Temsco  I was told it was simply a leak in the radiator fluid line  which it was  and I was told they d fixed it  which they hadn t  So the next day  I drive from Southern Oregon to Seattle  a good 600 mile trip  Truck drives fine  though the whole way  I m scared out of my gord it s gonna die again  and alas  10 miles from my final destination  it does  This times its a wee bit worse than before  one of the heads has cracked  and will need to be replaced  This is done  and after a few hundred bucks down the drain  I come to find out not only one head is cracked  but BOTH heads were cracked  and the other would need to be replaced  More money  both heads fixed  phew  Except now my engine is loud with a constant ticking noise that just won t stop  And for the next few years  it kept it up  never could get fixed  until the truck was traded in for a Toyota Camry  It was really one bad problem that made driving the truck a chore and kept me from being happy to own it  and with the other problems I ve seen Ford drivers have  I don t think you ll see me behind a Ford wheel ever again br br
