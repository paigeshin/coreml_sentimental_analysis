 This is essentially a re hash of the Crow Vic opinion that I wrote earlier I was driving a 1987 Honda CRX that was about to die  and needed something quickly  so I hit a dealer specializing in used police cars figuring I d get something inexpensive and interesting  I picked up a 1991 police package  formerly owned by the Connecticut state police Since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week  price was the main concern When the car was running  it was a lot of fun  Good acceleration  lots of  quot luxury quot  features that the Honda didn t have  but it lacked cruise control  so long drives were tiring  and dangerous if there were too many radar traps  Because of the size of the car and the engine  it was easy to creep up to 85 MPH  I did get interesting responses from other drivers  and didn t have to wait behind someone to get out of the passing lane  Unfortunately  the bad outweighed the good The police package was the only Crown Vic in 1991 with a carburetor Not only was it a carburetor  but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi  The one I had was going bad  The local Ford dealer wouldn t touch it  saying that the best that they could do was replace it  at a cost of  1100  I did manage to find a mechanic who specialized in them and only charged  500 to rebuild the one I had Eventually  all of the major systems on the car were replaced  one at a time  just to keep the car operating  It is also the last year for the 351 CUI engine When it was running  the handling wasn t particularly good  the breaking was poor  and the ride was soft  I can t even imagine what a standard Crown Vic would drive like  The acceleration was awesome  but at less then 20 miles per gallon  stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition If you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car  don t stop off at the local used police car salesman  The sticker price isn t even close to what it will cost in the end br br
