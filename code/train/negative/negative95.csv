 After owning a 1999 Expedition XLT for 2 years and being very pleased with it in every aspect  I expected the same from the 2003 Expedition  Exterior looks great  except for being a follower of the new Explorer  but I have nothing against that  I particularly loved the new interior design  The third row seating is a vast improvement in the new Expedition  I did not have the power fold option for the third row  which is not a problem when letting the seat down  but getting it back up is a little tricky  I was pleased with the performance of the 5 4V8L and the independent rear suspension  The handling of the truck was much better than the old model  The wider mirrors were great just watch what you re doing when pulling into the garage But on to other things  my truck had a constant rattle coming from both the driver and passenger side doors  This absolutely drove me crazy  I took the truck to the shop 4 times for repair  with no success  The dealer called in a Senior Engineer from Ford  but he never determined exactly what the cause was  So at that point  I was extremely disappointed with the workmanship of the truck  I hated getting into it each morning knowing I had to listen to the rattle for the 45 minute drive to work  We tried to get Ford to buy the truck back  but we got the run around  They told us that it was a problem with the new design and they were going to develop a solution  but as of right then they didn t have one  To me  it seems they were telling us just to  DEAL WITH IT  We have a really bad feeling about Ford and the new Expedition  I really liked the truck and thought I would never go back to a car or smaller SUV  but I did  I now own a Jeep Grand Cherokee  I didn t think I could love a vehicle as much as I love my Cherokee
