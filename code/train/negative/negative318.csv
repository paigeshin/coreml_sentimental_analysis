 The vehicle that I am reviewing is a 1999 Ford Windstar mini van  This is a company leased vehicle that is presently assigned to me while my new Crown Vic is on order  This van is as underpowered as the three Aerostar vans that preceded it  This van has the ability to SOUND like it is picking up speed  but it is only an illusion  The engine revs up and it sounds powerful  but alas you can not see the speedometer climb faster  Other than this being underpowered the roominess and creature comforts are average  The average gas mileage is 15 MPG with most of the miles on the freeway  This vehicle would be an OK choice if it s primary chore was toting junior to soccer or mom to the supermarket  If this van is to be used in a commercial operation the Chevy ASTRO would be a better choice br br
