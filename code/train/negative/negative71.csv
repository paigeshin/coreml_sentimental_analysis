 I have worked in the Automobile Manufacturing business most of my adult life  NO ONE has more stingent quality standards to uphold than Ford  I have supplied parts to every domestice manufacturer you can name  I have owned a Ranger for 12 years and now have a 93 Ford 150 4X4  I have loved both trucks  Especially the 150 is built very solidly  When the door shuts it shuts to a great fit  you can hear it On the new 150 I am not sure I like the new body  I liked the look of the pre 96 trucks esp the 95  The area I know live in seems to be GM truck land  My friends that all drive trucks prefer the GM  by far  then the Ford with the Dodge Ram being close to the Ford  There are more GMs in this area then Fords and Rams put together  My friends report that they prefer the GMs for these reasons 1 Styling  do not like the body look of 150 or Ram 2 Perceived Reliablity  Fords seem to have the reputation of using much more gas per relative engine size  as the GMs 3 All Full Size pickups are very expensive  most around here are 4x4s  and GM is the most  slightly  However GMs seem to hold their resale value and are worth much more worth the value  in this area If I was buying a brand new truck  at present it would be a GM
