 My wife leased a 1999 Ford explorer January 1999 It has been a nightmare ever since First problem was with the transmission  It started leaking 1 month after we got it  They decided a new seal was in order  It went back to the shop a total of three times before they figured that the transmission was defective  Then came the recalls  one for the cruise control then the front hood latch then for a defective windshield washer which would come on intermittently  To this day we are still having problems with it Now the airbag light stays on and the rear windshield washer refuses to work  we had another problem with the check engine light This is our first Ford vehicle and quite possibly our last In the early day Fords were ok  but now the quality has suffered br br
