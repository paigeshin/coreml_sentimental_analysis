 I loved it the moment my mom drove up in her new Windstar  I said  my next van would be just like it  but in white  So when it was time to trade in the old van  I jumped at the chance to get my 1999 Windstar  It had low miles  just under 36 000  and still had a bit of warranty left on it  Sad to say  it just wasn t enough time to find out what was truly wrong with my newly acquired vehicle The first week we had it  the lights began to flicker inside  We assumed that a door was ajar  but the warning light was not illuminating  We found out it was one of the many sensors inside the door  That  luckily was replaced free under the warranty Within a few weeks came a new problem  The back windshield wiper  would work only if you slammed the back hatch door  Another sensor is what I was told  and that bill was on me  We replaced the sensor  yet a few weeks later  it was on the blink again  This time  it was  as we were informed  a faulty switch  and would cost us to repair it  Needless to say  we don t have a back wiper at the moment Soon after this  I noticed that my rear view mirrors were vibrating while we were driving down the road  Figuring it was in need of balancing  I had the tires and alignment done  This did not help at all  and the vibration was just getting worse Just when I thought nothing else could go wrong  I found out that it could  The service engine light continually comes on and no amount of times that we have it on the  expensive  computer to test it they can find no valid reason for the problem As my transmission was shifting rather hard  I asked the dealer what it could be  I was then informed that the 1999 Windstar is notorious for having transmission troubles  This rebuild job is to cost me over  1600 00 No I will not be repairing anything else on the van  It is going to be a trade in  just as soon as possible I have heard from others who have this year Windstar  that there are two types of 1999 Windstars  The first being the one that never has a problem  and has grateful owners  And the second being the 1999 Windstars that got all the problems they could pack into one vehicle  Guess which one we bought
