 I bought this car on December 31 1998  Since I have had nothing but problems  In May of 1999  my transmission let go  This happened at 60 mph on the highway  Transmission specialists rate the Probe as a Specialty car  Therefore  the repair price was inflated 3 000  All the specialists I contacted claimed it was a VERY complicated job  I did find someone to do it for  1 500  The drawback was the Probe ended up being in their shop for a month  Next  the intake manifold gasket let go  Again  I heard SPECIALTY car  Again  I heard complicated to fix  I received a quote of  300   5 for the gasket 295 for the LABOR  I did find a decent mechanic who did the job for  150  I don t know if mechanics in others areas use the word SPECIALTY as an excuse to jack up the price  In my area it seems to be the norm  Ford Probes are known to have electrical problems  So far  mine have been minor just turn signals  Just last week  I got a flat  Of course this happens to any make or model car  The price for tires is higher than average  According to the tire dealer  the tires are specific  SPECIALTY I GUESS  to the car  I have very little faith in the car s dependability  I am just waiting to see what will go wrong next  I bought the PROBE because of her looks  She s a beauty  Therefore  I am NOT surprised by the problems  I had hoped the FORD CO  had paid some attention to mechanical parts  I love the way she drives when in tiptop condition  She s smooth as a baby s butt and purrs like a kitten  Upkeep  of course  will continue to remain a problem  It is fine for folks who have the budget to keep up with it  Money is not the only factor  The inconvenience and the waiting associated with the Probe going in and out of the shop is frustrating  It s a nice little car  but keep the Excedrin handy  When I purchased this car it had 71 000 miles  I have heard the engines last till somewhere around 150 000  All one can do is hope If you re considering purchasing a Probe please keep an eye out for its SPECIALTY problems   TRANSMISSION and ELECTRICAL  I really think it s best suited as a SECOND car br br
