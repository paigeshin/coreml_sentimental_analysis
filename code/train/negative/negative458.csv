 I came from a Ford family  and after driving a sports car for 9 years  decided to purchase a 1994 Ford Taurus GL early in 1996  Finally  a nice riding car with lots of space  It did great for the first two years  After that  BOOM  At about 55 000 miles it started overheating  and the transmission did not want to shift into gear  That s when I took it to my local reputable transmission repair shop  It would cost  1000 00 to fix or  100 00 for a temporary fix  The shop says it was such a high price because they would have to remove the motor  and all the air conditioning equipment  I opted for the temporary fix  That part went just fine until I realized several months later that the transmission problem caused a broken motor mount  Now  I had a whole new array of problems  The motor shifting around caused a hole in the air conditioning hose resulting in  240 00 worth of repairs  Next a freeze plug blew  Of course it was the one at the back of the motor  so out came the motor again for another  1000  Lo and behold  upon reinstalling motor the transmission was jerking again resulting in a punctured oil filter  I m now praying that this car holds over a little longer until I can afford to find another ride br br
