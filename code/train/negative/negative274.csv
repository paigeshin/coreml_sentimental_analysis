 I had purchased a 1997 contour sport new from a Dealership expecting it to be a good trouble free family car  The day after I bought it  I had found the spare wheel and jack missing  The Dealership had taken one out of another contour  A few months later  when the rain started coming down  I found that I had two inches of rain in the trunk  I took to the dealership and a week later in the shop they had fixed the leaks  About a month later the brakes started squeaking when backing up  it was loud  They had told me the parking brake cables were sticking and had worn out the rear break pads  So they had replaced the cables  replaced the brake pads and machined the rotors due to wear  The noise had stopped and the car ran good until the check engine light came on  I took it back to the dealership and they hooked it up to the diagnostic and found all kinds of problems with it  So they put me in a rental car until they can get the parts they needed to fix it  The car was under warranty so nothing came out of my pocket and the people were nice  About twenty miles over my warranty my coolant light came on  I checked the coolant and it was at its normal level  I called the dealership and told them the problem and they said it was probably a faulty switch and the warranty had expired  I told them all the troubles I had with it  but they didn t seem to care  A week later my brakes did the same thing when I had bought it new  I called the dealership and told them the problem had not been fixed since this was the same thing that happened the first time  All they could tell me is its out of warranty and your going to have to pay for the parts and labor  That s when I blew up and told them all the problems I had with this NEW car  they didn t seem to care so I hung up and went to the dealership and wasted my time arguing about it  I left with the problem still needing attention  About a month later I had another problem with the car  The car wouldn t come out of park until you messed with it for about ten minutes  I called the dealership and asked for the service manager and told him what I was experiencing now  I didn t get anywhere with him  I finally had it and put the car up for sale and will NEVER buy another ford br br
