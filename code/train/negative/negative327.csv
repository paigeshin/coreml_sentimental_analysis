 Let me tell you all a story  You can decide for yourself if you would consider purchasing this vehicle from this dealer or any other  I leased my 99 Windstar about a year and a half ago from Freehold Ford in New Jersey  When I picked up the van from the dealer I noticed a large tear in the carpet  How can this be you ask  after all dealers prep is always charged  I don t know  They agreed that it would have to be replaced  and ordered the carpet  I was also missing 1 of the original keys which they told me they had but never produced  so I had to bring the van in so they could make a key  Ok  the new carpet is ready so I bring it in  leave it for 2 days  and then pick it up  When I look at it   the carpet appears to have been installed by a blind man  no offense to the blind  I tell them and now I have to leave it another day to fix that  Well  that s all taken care of  but the sun is out and my wife lowers the visor which then proceeds to drop and dangle as if hanging from a thread  now they order a new visor and when it arrives I have to leave the van another day so they can replace it  A few months go by and I open the rear hatch door which proceeds to fall on my head  It seems that one of the pistons that support the door went bad and had to be replaced  Time to order a new one and another day in the shop  A few more months go by and now the power sliding door doesn t always work  the rear interior light fell out and wont stay put  and the reverse sensors have stopped working  I bring the van back to Freehold Ford once again and leave it for a few days to be repaired  Everything is repaired but they can t find a problem with the door  Now I have it and the door still only operates when it want s to  Some more time goes by and the transmission is now leaking  I bring it back again  They keep it for 5 days and give it back saying it s fixed  but guess what  Still leaks and the door still isn t operating properly  So now back it goes again where they keep it for 4 more days and decide they have to order a new transmission  They will call me when it comes in  That process takes almost 2 months in which while I am waiting  the power steering goes and the interior power door button falls out and won t go back  Yes  finally I have had enough  I go to the manager of Freehold Ford and explain everything that has gone on and tell him I want out of the lease  He tells me that he has to speak to the Ford regional rep  He will get back to me  He then informs me that the rep told him he will not get me out of the lease because these are minor problems and the lemon law does not apply  I also call Ford customer dis service myself and besides being totally useless a few of the reps were so rude I wanted to strangle them  Now the trans  is in  so I leave the van again for 4 days  Current situation is no transmission leak  power steering not operating properly  and the power sliding door still operates whenever it want s to  i called Ford again and was told by the rep to  quot do whatever you feel you have to do quot  I asked the manager of Freehold Ford if I could speak to the rep myself  He said he would call the rep and get back to me  never did even after 3 requests  Now I m not cutting down all Ford products  but I am telling you that Ford and Freehold Ford DO NOT give a damn about their customers  You would think that with ford in the papers and the news every day getting negative press that they would be a little inclined to show the world that the bad publicity isn t all true Decide for yourself
