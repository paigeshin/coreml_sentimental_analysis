 I always thought  147Windstar 148 was a dumb name  Well  it 146s not looking so bad now that they 146ve updated the Windstar and renamed it  147Freestar 148 Why the new name  Well  someone high up at Ford decided it would be neat to begin all Ford car model names with the letter  147F 148 The Mustang and T Bird get grandfathered  but all other Ford car names that begin with a letter other than  147F 148 will soon be history  Why do this  Well  beginning all SUV names with the letter  147E 148 seems to have worked well  Also   147Windstar 148 had a lot of baggage   But apparently not so much to get rid of the  147star 148 bit  The downside of this new strategy is that it seems to be resulting in some awful names  The upcoming Mazda6 based  147Futura 148 isn 146t bad  But the upcoming large sedan  the  147Five Hundred 148 makes no sense to me because there are no other cars whose names are numbers  And  147Freestar 148 what 146s that  At least if they name a car  147Freebird 148 they 146ll have a jingle ready to go Aside from the new name  Ford has made a number of changes to its minivan  The third row now folds Honda style into the floor  A full battery of safety features is now available  including stability control and curtain airbags  The interior materials have been upgraded  And the 200 horsepower 3 8 liter V6 has been replaced by two engines  a 193 horsepower 3 9 and a 201 horsepower 4 2  both based on the 3 8  Why bother upgrading the 3 8 to a 3 9  One reason might be to suggest that the problematic  head gasket blowing 3 8 is history  Well  the basic engine is still here  but hopefully the 3 8 146s weaknesses have been eliminated This model year has seen new minivans from Toyota and Nissan as well  Reviewing the Honda recently  I concluded that none of the existing vans was perfect  Each had significant weaknesses  But I had not yet driven the new Ford  I never thought much of the Windstar  One I drove years ago felt much cruder than other minivans  But might the Freestar somehow surprise me  I took one for a test drive to find out b Styling  The styling of the Windstar always looked awkward to me  Something just was not right with the proportions  For the Freestar most of the sheetmetal remains unchanged  The front fenders and hood are new  though  The new front end is more massive than the old ones and is cleanly styled much like Ford 146s current range of SUVs  with a large trapezoidal grille  Thankfully the long side of the trapezoid is on top  With some Windstars it has been on the bottom  suggesting a frown At any rate  the new front end seems to have done much to lend the van better proportions  The fender flares from the Windstar remain  but they look better on the Frestar 146s larger front fender  Overall  the exterior styling of the Freestar is not strikingly attractive on interesting  but it appears thoroughly tasteful  even somewhat handsome now  Later in the model year optional 17 inch alloys will further improve the look of the van judging from the photos in the brochure  The Toyota Sienna is the new ugly queen in this segment The interior possesses little in the way of style  good or bad  Unless you find the Passat 146s interior stylish  because the Freestar 146s interior is a blatant knock off of the VW sedan 146s  The basic forms are square  most notably the nearly square center stack  Few curves are to be found  The instruments  with their chrome rings  are probably the nicest looking bit  Most off putting is the fake wood in the SEL trim line  The three lower trim lines  S  SE  SES  have matte black on the center stack and a strip of faux aluminum dividing the darker upper part of the instrument panel from the lighter lower part  the rest of the interior is in the lighter shade  With the top of the line Limited both pieces are faux wood  With the SEL  however  only the strip is faux wood  It doesn 146t look so good  Maybe the Limited  with more of the stuff  will look better  Sadly  if you want leather you need one of the top trim lines  so you 146ll be getting some faux wood with it Aside from this bit of trim the quality of the interior is superior to the Windstar 146s  The low gloss materials do not look luxurious  but do look durable  They aren 146t quite up to the Passat 146s  but they were clearly an attempt in that direction compared to past Fords  The leather has a thick  durable feel to it  The top of the dash is soft touch material  the lower part is hard plastic  typical of this class of vehicle  The various buttons feel a bit higher in quality than those of past Fords  The controls are conventionally arranged  unlike the Nissan there is nothing crazy here  Overall  the appearance of the Freestar 146s interior is at least mid pack  better than the Nissan and GM  perhaps a bit nicer than the Honda  and trailing only the Toyota and maybe the Chrysler  the latter comes across as classy overall  but does have some cheap bits   Accommodations  The Freestar at 201 inches is within an inch of most competitors  Yet the interior is tighter than all other extended vans with the possible exception of GM 146s  it has been a while since I sat in the back of a GM minivan  The front seat is roomy enough  with good comfort  The driving position is not my favorite  as the bulky looking instrument panel is a half foot higher than the beltline  bottom of side windows  Especially in a Chrysler the view forward is much more expansive  But some people might prefer the more closed in feeling of the Ford  as it might make them feel safer  As in the Windstar the interior front door panels actually rise a few inches above the beltline  effectively reducing the side glass area  I suspect some market research lay behind this decision Ford continues to offer a second  wide angle rearview mirror to keep tabs on the rear seats  A useful feature that Toyota has copied The pedals in the minivan I drove were adjustable  With the pedals all the way back I had to position the seat all the way back  even though I 146m only 5 9  reducing rear passenger room  I like an arms outstretched driving position  but would likely compromise this when carrying adults in the back  The driver 146s seat itself is memorable for neither discomfort nor exceptional comfort  Still  the front row is easily the best in the van The second row captain 146s chairs feel a little on the small side for adults and are a little too close to the floor to provide good thigh support  Luckily these include build in armrests  for there is none on the door  Get the bench  standard on the S  SE  and SES  and I 146m not sure what passengers will do with their arms  The second row seats tumble forward to provide access to the third row  I found it nearly as easy to simply walk between the captain 146s chairs The third row is perhaps the most cramped of any extended length minivan  It sits low to the floor  providing no thigh support  and because of very thick sidewalls  the left one contains the rear A C  the shoulder room in this row is only 51 inches  more than a foot less than the second row and about a half foot less than you 146ll find in the rear seat of the typical midsize sedan  Notably  the Honda Odyssey provides over ten inches more third row shoulder room  Yet only two people sit in the Ford 146s second row even with the bench  while three sit in the third row  I don 146t get it  Legroom  or more specifically footroom  is also limited in the third row  The culprits are very thick inner pedestrals under the second row captain 146s chairs  Between these pedestals there is only room for one foot to squeeze in  Where should the second foot go  The second row seats adjust fore and aft a few inches to juggle legroom  However  although the seat moves the pedestals do not  So moving the seat doesn 146t help unless you move it so far up that third row passengers can put their feet on top of the pedestals  At that point the second row will have no legroom Overall the Freestar 146s rear seating and roominess is very disappointing  Compared to the Toyota Sienna  it offers 2 2 inches less legroom in the front seats  1 6 inches less in the second row  and a huge 6 8 inches less in the third row  As moving seats back and forth shifts legroom from row to row  these numbers are cumulative  for a total legroom disadvantage of over ten inches  This despite the fact that the Freestar is an inch longer than the Toyota in both overall length and wheelbase The Freestar s third row seat does stow into the deep well provided for it fairly easily  Three clearly labelled steps are involved  one more than in the Odyssey  The extra latch permits the seat to be rotated rearward 90 degrees to serve as a bench for tailgating while the van is parked  Unlike in the Nissan  the tether used to pull the third row into the well is long enough to extend outside the well  The split bench in the Toyota is the easiest to stow  but the Ford edges out the Honda  and the Nissan is by far the most difficult  and finger threatening  In the Ford  unlike in the Honda and Nissan  the headrests do not have to be removed before stowing the seat  The downside is that they  and those in the second row  are not high enough in their lowest position to protect adults When the third row is in place the deep well can be used for cargo  It is a good size to hold grocery bags upright  preventing their contents from rolling about the entire floor  The maximum cargo volume  134 cubic feet  is about ten cubic feet shy of the extended minivan norm  Probably those thick rear sidewalls again On the upper trim lines a center console is a  150 option  It isn 146t very tall  not even coming up to the level of the seat cushions  and contains only a sedan sized storage compartment  It is not very wide because the parking brake  like the Windstar 146s  is between the front seats  The center consoles available in the Chrysler and Toyota vans are significantly larger  Other storage compartments are located in the Freestar 146s center stack  roof console  doors  and atop the center of the instrument panel  A fairly large glove compartment is also provided  There is plenty of storage aside from the optional console  but some people will still want it because of its handy location b On the Road  The 4 2 liter 146s 201 peak horsepower trails all the GM vans 146 3 4 liter among extended length minivans  but it leads them all in midrange power  with 263 pounds feet of torque at a moderate 3650 RPM  Even the 3 9 produces 245 pounds feet  tying the Chrysler 3 8 and leading all others  Unlike the Honda  Toyota  and top line Nissan  however  Ford continues to use a four speed automatic  Perhaps because its gearing is thus taller than the others  or because the revised engine still falls well short of Honda 146s and Toyota 146s in refinement  noise quality at full throttle  and willingness to rev  acceleration with the 4 2 feels just adequate  The Japanese vans and especially the Honda feel considerably quicker  That said  how quick does a minivan need to feel From behind the wheel the Freestar feels larger and heavier than the competition  partly due to the relatively high instrument panel but also due to the chassis dynamics  The van understeers heavily in turns and generally communicates that it does not wish to be hurried  The steering is not overly light  unlike many past Ford products  Lean is moderate The payoff for this below average handling is excellent ride quality  This ride quality I suspect that Ford 146s engineers derived their priorities from those of van buyers  I drove the Freestar along a road full of chuckholes and very uneven expansion joints  Cars generally ride poorly on this road  but in the Freestar imperfections were heard only a little and felt even less  This ride quality was obtained through intelligent design  not simply through ultra soft suspension settings  As a result  the van remain composed over rough surfaces and did not bobble about b Safety  Like the Windstar the Freestar should ace crash tests  It offers traction control  stability control  front seat airbags  and curtain airbags in all three rows  as much safety equipment as can be found on any minivan  Topping the others  the last as in the Explorer is linked to a rollover sensor and functions as a canopy keeping people from hitting the ceiling in the event of such an accident  I doubt many minivans roll over  but if one did this would be good to have b Pricing  The  147price paid 148 listed below is the sticker price of the van I drove  To make the Freestar more comparable to other minivans  especially the Honda Odyssey with its very limited feature flexibility  I will compare a Windstar SEL with leather  power sliding doors  side and side curtain airbags  traction control  stability control  and rear obstacle detection  The list price is  33 230 and the price after discount and rebate to about  28 900  Heated seats and automatic temperature control are only available on the Limited  which even after adjusting for major content runs about  850 more  Those uninterested in the Limited 146s two tone paint  turn signal indicators in the mirrors  message center  and so forth will be better off getting aftermarket seat heaters installed  Those who love every last knick knack should of course get the Limited Note  Currently in many regions the  975 package that includes stability control  traction control  and rear obstacle detection is free on Limiteds and  750 on SELs  I have included these discounts in my comparisons  The Odyssey EX L lists for  28 980  Likely because of the increased competition  Honda increased prices only  90 from 2003 and its dealers are now discounting these vans  but still not by much  Edmunds suggests that the typical discount reduces the price to about  28 200  After adjusting for content differences  the Honda lacks stability control  curtain airbags  adjustable pedals  and rear obstacle detection but has heated seats and automatic temperature control  the Honda is about  200 more expensive  The Honda is easily worth the extra money because of its superior powertrain  roomier interior  more comfortable rear seats  and less rapid depreciation The hot van is now the Toyota Sienna  The Sienna 146s options are bundled much like the Ford 146s  Toyota 146s new system which puts everything into a huge number of packages is very confusing  but I waded through the descriptions to find the best one   12 of 21 XLE packages  The list price of a Sienna XLE with Package 12 and floormats is  32 871  and Edmunds suggests no discounting  Adjusting for equipment differences  sunshades  automatic climate control  heated seats  17 inch wheels  power liftgate  center console  JBL sound system  would narrow the gap by about  1 450  Even with a  2 500 price disadvantage  1 650 with the Limited  the Toyota still seems the better buy  but the Honda is better still The Nissan Quest SL is equipped between the Toyota and the Honda  It has curtain airbags  fold flat second row captain 146s chairs  rear obstacle detection  power passenger 146s seat  power liftgate  adjustable pedals  and fixed skylights in back rows  but it has no driver 146s side power slider and its automatic has only four speeds  It lists for  30 030  Dealer discounts reduce this to around  29 400  Adjusted for content the Nissan is about  100 more than the Ford  The Nissan is a less refined vehicle with inferior interior materials  but it has a larger interior  many innovative features  and striking styling  so those who care about such things should check it out In reaction to the Odyssey 146s relatively low prices  Chrysler introduced value models of its minivans three years ago  A Town   Country eX with leather and side airbags lists for  30 500  The typical discount and a  1 000 rebate reduce this to about  28 000  The Chrysler has a power passenger seat and power liftgate  and its third row does not fold flat  but is otherwise equipped like the Honda  Adjusted for equipment it is about  350 less expensive  The Chrysler feels a bit more agile and is roomier  the Ford has the trick third row  GM offers the least expensive extended minivans once discounts and rebates are taken into account   The Kia Sedona is cheaper still but is considerably smaller than the others  and at any rate only marginally competitive  The GM vans are less roomy and powerful than the others  but despite the oldest chassis here they handle fairly well  especially in their short wheelbase variants  Their weakest area may be cheap looking interiors  The seats 146 appearance is especially disappointing  but leather helps a great deal  A fold flat third row is available  but only with cloth  A Pontiac Montana equipped as closely as possible to the above Ford lists for  31 250  but the typical discount and a  2 500 rebate reduces this to about  26 200  Adjusted for content the GM van is  1 700 less  For another  230 you can get a sport suspension complete with automatic leveling  a rarity in this class  I have not tested a GM van so equipped  so I cannot evaluate this option  An old design but still worthy of consideration by those seeking the lowest price and good handling in an extended length van Except for the Toyota Sienna on the high end and the GM vans on the low end  all of the extended length minivans are priced within a few hundred dollars of each other right now  All of them are arguably better buys than the Ford  but only the Honda is clearly a better choice I do not like how Ford has made heated seats and automatic climate control  two popular features  available only on the knick knack laden Limited  For those uninterested in all the bells and whistles the Limited is about  1 000 less competitive than the SEL  I also find it odd that the SES  with its slightly sportier exterior  cannot be bought with many popular features  including leather b Last Words  The Freestar was the only extended minivan I had not driven  I expected little based on my evaluation of the Windstar  but was prepared to be surprised  I was not surprised  The Freestar rides well and has a fairly nice interior  but its handling  room  and seat comfort are at best marginally competitive  I cannot recommend this vehicle  The Honda and Chrysler seem the best products when price is considered  It so happens that both will be revised for 2005  As I suggest in my Odyssey review  If you can wait
