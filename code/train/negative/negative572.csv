 I purchased a  95 Contour GL in Aug of  97 for  9000  It had only 29k kiles on it  It had the 2 0 four cylinder and 5 speed  Before the warranty expired  the deal replaced free the rack and pinion steering syste  the A C blower  condenser and evaporator  and did some recall service  It was already a lemon under warranty  The cup holder broke kwik  the headlight plastic lense turned dark yellow  deminishing light output  The alternator failed  I had to replace the battery twice  and the alternator was very very hard to remove and replace  My mechanic friend replaced it and ins not a good sign when a pro complains about your car  The throw out bearing in the tranny was about to go out at 63k miles when I sold the car in Feb of  00  The car had bad resale value The only good thing was that my MPG never dropped below 23MPG in the city  I routinly averaged 30 31mpg on long out of town trips  and the seats and fron leg room was comfortable   I m 6 00  with long arms and legs The back seat was very small  Everyone complained  Handling was bad too  I replaced the tires with some Michelin Roadhandler Sports from Sears and made a huge differance in cornering  Excellent tires can make up for a bad car  It has horrible breaks  They fade very quickly  If you want a cheap car that breaks a lot and has no resale value buy the Contour  If you want a cheap car that is dependable and has decent resale value  buy a 95 altima from nissan
