 I had a Red 2000 Taurus SES as a loaner car for almost 2 weeks  I put almost 1000 miles on it in a combination of city driving and long trips  Overall I was mostly disappointed with Ford s family sedan  but it did have some good points I should mention Pros It was bigger than most  if not all  of the cars in it s class  such as a Accord or Camry  I m over 6 feet tall  and I had plenty of room up front and so did people in the back  even with my seat all the way back  The only car in this class that has as much room is the Chevy Impala   which is an incredibly ugly car by the way The trunk was very large and easily held luggage for 4  Compared to other rental cars I have had  such as a Mazda 626  the Taurus was much better for long trips The steering was great  It was the perfect balance of being communicative yet comfortable  Not as sporty as a Focus or a Mustang  but certainly not a boat on wheels like a Crown Victoria or an Impala Didn t attract attention  I have been known to exceed the speed limit  once in a great while  and I think a Ford Taurus is just about as anonymous as you can get in terms of attention from the Police OK now for the things I didn t like Interior materials  Although the design was ergonomic enough  the dash had too much hard plastic and the switchgear felt like it came from an econobox  I think my Focus has a better quality interior  Also the steering wheel on the Taurus is ugly Seats  The seats were flat and uncomfortable  I did have the bench seat up front  and so I would hope that a model with bucket seats would be better  The car had that  fake leather  on the seats that looks nice for about 10 000 miles then starts to look like the plastic you would find the the backseat of a cab Noise  There was too much wind  engine  and tire noise  For a car that Ford claims was designed in a wind tunnel there is way too much wind noise coming off the side mirrors  I suspect the door seams are sub par  The engine did not sound nearly as refined as you would hear in a V6 Accord or Camry  and when you put your foot down it sounded like it was going to crash through the firewall and end up in your lap  The Taurus I drove had the upgraded engine  and I would hate to think what an owner of a base model would have to put up with on a daily basis Radio   The radio reception was terrible and the speakers were the kind you would buy off the sale rack at Walmart A Taurus has the stigma of being rental and a loaner car  It has no personality whatsoever  nor does it have the quality and reliability you would find in a Toyota  Honda  Mazda  or even a Nissan or a Mitsubishi Don t get me wrong  I am sure there are tens of thousands of Taurus owners who love their cars and are perfectly happy with them  But if you are looking for a car with some character and even a mildly engaging driving experience you are better off in something else  You might pay a little more if you want the same options but it s worth it in the long run  not to mention resale value
