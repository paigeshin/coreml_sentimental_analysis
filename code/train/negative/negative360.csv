 Right now I drive a 1999 Ranger 4X4 x cab 4dr 4 0L  but I d like to go back to my first in 1986 when I as 19  NEW Ranger  1My dad co signed for my first new truck  I bought a 86  Ranger standard cab 4X4 STX with one of the first push button 4X4 systems  I thought that was  way cool  back then  As far as longevity goes for this one I can t say but I know it could take a lot  Being a stupid 19yr old kid and adding a 100 000 mi bumper to bumper that I was told would cover any thing I drove it as if I was Mickey Thompson  I lived to get all fours off the ground and being a 19yr old party animal in a rural community I found opportunity practically daily  I was 4by n with a friend in this truck and making those tv commercials appear tame and in the mist of roaring laughter and fast paced action my friend turns to me and says  quot next time around let me out quot  I reply  quot you scared quot  and he says  quot no I ve only seen this on tv quot  and this was daily with this truck  being reckless I totaled it with 12 000 mi on it and it NEVER SAW A SHOP ONCE  That s damn good when you consider those off road racers rebuild those truck after each race  To give you the sense of reckless abandon that 19 yr old drove his truck with remember in  quot Ferris Bueller s Day Off quot  the parking attendants faces in the Ferrai as it was flying through the air  That was the elation I experienced for 12 000 miles  My relationship with that truck is like looking back on old girlfriends from my youth  The times I had and the memories I would never want removed but I could never have that type of a relationship with a vehicle again and have never had all four off the ground with any other vehicle in my life since  By the way  to this day I still remember the salesman saying  quot You ll be a Ford man for life quot  so far he s been right So now I go through a few used vehicle wondering if buying new is worth it NEW Ranger  21991 just broke up with a girl and replace her with a truck  A little
