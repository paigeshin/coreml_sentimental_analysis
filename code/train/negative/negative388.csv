 I get my Fords for free  I m an insurance adjustor with a large national insurance company  they provide us with a new Taurus when we hit 60 000 miles  I think this will give me an unadulterated opinion of the vehicle I ve had two so far  a 1997 Ford Taurus GL  and a 1999 Ford Taurus SE The major problems I ve experienced with both of these cars is electrical problems  The first one was a disaster  In 60 000 miles  the car went into the shop 14 times for electrical problems  They ranged from interior lights that would not ever go out when the car was on  thus making it dangerous to drive at night   I had to pull the lights under the dashboard and keep the dome light off  to the power steering going out at 75mph right before taking a curve on the interstate  I had the power windows go out  the power locks suddenly lock or unlock as you re cruising down the street  the alternator needed a change  and I went through three computers The second one is quite minor  I currently have 8500 miles on it  and the radio clock keeps blinking on and off as you drive  I ll have Ford look at it next time it goes in for maintenance As far as comfort  this is an excellent car  My office is in my car  and the SE package is very nice  with electric seats  lumbar support  and the remote that locks unlocks the door and opens the trunk is a nice touch   you don t need to set down all your packages  or in my case a ladder that fits in the trunk  to open the trunk   just hold it in your hand and pop it open  then set your things right in it As far as safety  being in the insurance industry and having the company purchase these cars exclusively for its employees should be testimony enough   they have superb safety ratings  They hold up well in crashes  and they do a good job of protecting the passengers Remember one thing though  in the purchase of a Ford product Fix Or Repair Daily I used to think that was just a joke  however  with my experience with the Taurus  that is close to true br br
