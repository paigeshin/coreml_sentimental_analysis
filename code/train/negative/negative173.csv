 We bought a 91 Taurus almost 2 years ago  It seemed to be in fairly good shape and drove well for a short time  The first sign of problems to come was the CV joints  After they were replaced  the brakes squealed BADLY even after the pads and shoes were replaced  Then the famous CHECK ENGINE light intermittently throughout the drive  But  saving the best for last  the notorious TRANSMISSION BUG has to be the best icon for the 91 Taurus they should condsider changing their logo  No downshifting on highway exits  no upshifting when entering a busy street spontaneous shifting up AND down while going down the street  Or MY personal favourite  the NO shifting  No up  down  sideways just no gear at all just a loud screaming transmission then a sudden neck cracking lurch into 2nd gear and on a related note  I have NO speedometer now thanks to the transmission  Currently relying on a radar detector to avoid tickets  lol But to be fair  I will say that  when I am not getting whip lash from the jerky transmission  which I can find NO mech to work on for less than twice what I paid for the car due to the  quot upgrades quot  ford made to the 91 model s transmissions  or wetting myself from the ever worsening loose steering  it IS a comfortable ride with lots of room front and back but in my opinion  a 10 speed bicycle would be a better deal br br
