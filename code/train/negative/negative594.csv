 My second Explorer  a 2WD 1996 has been a different experience than my first  a 1993 model  I have 35714 miles on it  and it is on its 3rd automatic transmission  This time around I am out of warranty  and out of luck  and after pleading my case with Ford  I was told they will offer no comment or assistance  Outside of several thousand dollars in repair expenses on a 3 year old vehicle on its 3rd transmission  the car has performed satisfactory The interior has remained solid  free of cracks and fading  amazing in the 110 degree summer heat of my area  It has not given me any engine troubles and the brakes and normal wear and tear items have been uneventful  They have reduced the cup holder size  and removed the slot for coffee cup handles  so that if you are drinking anything other than a fast food small drink  it will be on your lap due to lack of room Handling is O K  however as will as Explorers I have driven or owned  the rear wheels slide in wet conditions when making a corner  even at slow speeds The paint still looks new  my color was called Mocha  but looks Gold  and the black trim cleans up well  I would warn that dealing with Ford on repair issues can be painful at best  and to document EVERYTHING with the service department
