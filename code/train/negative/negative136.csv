 Nick bought our little navy blue 1993 Ford Ranger brand new 10 years ago with all of 5 miles on it  By 4000 miles the trouble had begun and they just culminated in a disaster that almost got me killed last week The Ranger is the little truck  Ours is a regular cab and regular bed  2 wheel drive  5 speed manuel  Nothing fancy or special  6 cyl  4 0 L  It got relatively good gas mileage  I m guestimating about 20  MPG  It s a cute little truck  resembling the Chevy S10 pretty closely The cloth interior was fairly easy to keep clean and for a bench seat in a truck  was actually pretty comfy  as comfy as it could possibly be for what it was It wasn t a race car so I didn t expect it to be fast  but it actually did handle much better than I anticipated  I scared Nick the way I took curves sometimes  For a truck  it handled curves pretty impressively actually When the brakes worked  they worked well  I could stop that thing on a dime  Yes  there actually were times in between repairs that I did enjoy driving this little truck The trouble began with the clutch fluid  See  the thingy is  inside  the bell housing on the Ranger  which is pretty odd  At about 4000 miles it started leaking  First we were having to add fluid like every other month  then every month  then every day  We finally took it in and had the unit changed about 2 years ago  it was fine for 6 month  then we had to start adding fluid again every month  you get the picture  Pain in the butt The oil was the same way  I had to add oil every 200 miles or so About 4 years ago some hoses went out  easy enough to replace a hose  right  Go in to the auto parts store and tell em ya want the hose to fit the 93 Ranger  sure they have that  Errr wait  It doesn t fit  There is no hose that fits  As a matter of fact  that hose was jerry rigged  at the factory   I kid you not  You could see where they had to heat it and stretch it to get it to fit  Real nice  eh We ve gone through clutches and had the transmission redone once  Accessories broke like clockwork  The brakes didn t last as long as they should  What else  ooooh yeas  the electrical system  We have jet skiis and a dual trailer  One year we decided to tow them on down to Key West for Christmas as our present to ourselves  About half way there  the lights went out  We bought a fuse  It blew  This continued the entire trip  I m not sure what got replaced finally to end that nightnmare  but it sucked This thing was just one problem after another for ten years  It was paid off  so we kept dealing with it  We should have gotten rid of it years ago  It made that decision for us last Monday I had just gotten back from the shop  New tires all around  new brakes  and oil change  Got the Safety Inspection sticker on Monday afternoon  So I decide to drive up to DC to see Nick who has been working up there during the week  I get to the draw bridge and clank clunk screech  can t shift  can t move  Dead in the middle of a slight curve on a damn draw bridge and the damn truck cannot even be pushed out of the way  It s totally seized up at 2 AM  The cars rushing past are barely swerving out of the way in time to avoid a major firey crash  I m standing there in the middle of the night leaning on my cane in tears and there is absolutely nothing I can do about anything  This was not fun  I now have a mental block when it comes to Fords  I ll never by another one  Luckily  a Tow Truck happened along on his way home about 15 minutes later and blocked the lane with his flashing lights  then got me towed to safety  even though I had NO cash on me i Double T Towing  of College Park  MD is owned by Tony and he is a sweetheart  I paid him the next day So now it s dead  and I am not going to resurrect it  We re donating it to some place for the tax credit  Cutting our losses as much as possible  I mean we had just put over  500 into it that weekend  Grr argh I do not recommend buying Ford  Anyone can get a lemon  that s true  but you have to consider the hose issue  Any company that sells a vehicle new off the show room floor with jerry rigged parts is a company that I do not want to do business with  Ever You ve been warned
