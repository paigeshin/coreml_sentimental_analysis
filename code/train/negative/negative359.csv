 I purchased my 1999 Ford Ranger new in June of 1999  It was a four wheel drive flareside regular cab with the xlt and off road package  Let me start off by saying that Ford offers excellent financing  I got 2 9  they also offer competitive rebates  Usually you have to choose either the rebate or the low finance rate  In addition to the affordability  I chose my truck because of its looks and style  From the day I drove off the lot I got compliments on what a  cool truck  I had  Initially I was pleased with my truck  After a few months I started noticing creaks in the dash  this seemed unusual for a truck so new  I also received a recall notice from Ford for a faulty wiper switch which if not replaced could short out the system  Into Ford I went for this problem to be fixed  A few months later my entire truck began to shake above 50mph  This brought me into the dealership again where after examination  they determined that it was a snapped bolt in the driveshaft assembly  This problem was fixed under warranty  but disturbed me a bit as the truck had only 20 000 miles on it  Shortly after that I received a flat tire on a road going aprox  40mph  After careful inspection by a mechanic  it was discovered that the tire went flat due to a faulty valve  I m glad I was only going 40mph Gas mileage for me was slightly below the sticker  I consistently got 18 20mph with mostly highway driving  While economy and truck do not usually go together  I was disturbed by the fact that full size Chevrolets average 25mpg with larger engines than my Ranger  I had the 3 0 V6 Overall I liked the truck  but not enough to keep it  Rising gas prices and disappointments led me to trade my truck for a new Honda 2001 Civic  see my review  That leads me to my last complaint  Resale value  This truck only had 26 000 miles on it at the time of trade  I shopped numerous dealerships and looked at several different model cars  I just broke even on my balance due Ford of aprox  11 000 00  This truck had a sticker price when new of  19 135 00  I know American cars depreciate faster than foreign models but give me a break  My truck was in showroom condition  I guess you get what you pay for My final word is if your looking for an inexpensive truck that gets you from point a to b and you can handle constant  quirks  buy a Ford Ranger  Otherwise shop around
