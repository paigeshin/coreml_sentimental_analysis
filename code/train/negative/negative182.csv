 I bought a  93 Ford Tempo 3 years ago for  3 000  Its A C didn t work and I haven t tried to repair it  When I bought it  it had  54 000 and now it has a little bit over  90 000  So far the biggest problem with it was the electrics  Cruise control would work  but if I went over a bump it would stop working  Windows go down and up at their will  I hate the brake  I have to put a lot of energy into stepping on it to reach the stopping point  I don t think that it s very stabile  The only thing that kind of makes me happy about owning this car is that it never had any major breakdown  It s engine works just fine  and I have taken it to several road trips  If you get annoyed by little things  then I guess you shouldn t buy this car because they break all the time  If you want to get something that will take you from the point A to the point B  than it s OK br br
