 I can not place this vehicle on my love it or hate it list because both are true  In 1996  my husband and I decided to purchase a new car  He wanted something he could tow things with and keep his tools in  I wanted something with four doors so I would not have to fight with car seats  We searched around our area and came across the perfect medium  It had what we both wanted  We bought this 1992 Ford Explorer  quot Eddie Bower quot Edition SUV  We were both happy with our purchase  We made our purchase in October of 1996  By May of 1997  we had to replace the transmission  I attributed this to my husband going four wheeling in a two wheel drive vehicle  This venture cost us  1900 We shipped the truck to Germany and for three years we prayed that we would not have transmission problems  We did  once  but my husband was able to fix that on his own  We did  however  have problems with the starter  We replaced it several times while in Germany  This ran us  300  each time  We attributed that to the weather in Germany All of this puts us in the year 2000  We return from Germany and embark on a road trip from Pennsylvania to Texas  Our move involved towing a trailer  We were assured by the Ford Dealer and the transmission shop that the transmission would hold up for the trip They were wrong  We made it as far as Odessa  Texas  To be exact  we made it to mile marker 104 on I 10  That is where we were stranded because the transmission blew out  Four days and  1900 later  we have yet another transmission  It is under a 90 day guarantee  We are assured that we will no longer have problems with the transmission Sixty five days later  my husband is on foot because the transmission has gone out AGAIN  We now have to tow the truck over 200 miles to get the transmission replaced under the warranty  Another  342 we have to spend just getting the truck to the destination  Not to mention the money of getting there to get the truck when it is fixed It seems everyone knew about the problems with Ford A Cs another review all together  starters  and transmissions  They just all seemed to forget until after we had all the problems  The above is why I hate the Explorer This is why I love it It is paid for  I have the title for it  It is roomy  I love that it has the 60 40 seats  There is plenty of room for suitcases and tools all at the same time  The car seats all fit comfortably  I have had three bulky car seats in the back at one time Being a short woman  I love the adjustment switches that allow me to be close enough and hight enough to see over the steering wheel  This is funny to my husband because he has to move the seat back before he can even get in the truck  When I am in my Explorer  I feel as big as the other people on the road  I will be upset when we sell the Explorer for the reasons listed above  You can bet that I will look for something larger so I do not feel like a  short  person on the road  I love my Explorer  but I hate that I do not have deep enough pockets to keep it
