 I bought a used Contour in 1998  At that time it had 34k miles on it  I wanted the car right when I saw it and wanted it even more after test driving  I had some trouble getting the car to pass MD inspection  Minor stuff  Brakes etc  It took a while to accomplish this  About  300 total cost  The car was great  Others would look at the car in awe and I loved it  The car offered speed and comfort and made me feel like a queen on the road  I was able to keep up with the big dogs on the road  Nice right  The truth about the Contour did not wait too long to rear its ugly head  Six months later  the transmission began to slip  Although it was still covered under warranty  I had to still pay  100  Summer  1999   Tire blow out  The car had to be aligned and I had to buy 4 new tires  The mechanic said that the car was so badly out of line  he wanted to know how it got that way   600 for tires and a serious alignment Summer  2000  The engine sensor came on  It began to make a loud humming noise  I dragged it to the dealer and they told me that it had something to do with emissions  That repair cost me  800  Summer  2000  The car began to make this horrible noise  I was told by a mechanic that it was the Sway bar Another  100  Fall  2000 Winter 2001   Power steering fluid leak  The dealer fixed the leak and charged me  400  5 days later  the car had no power steering and the fluid leak was worse than before  I took the car back and the dealer told me that the engine mounts were bad  Another  400 Fall  2001   Speedometer goes out  The car needed speedometer cables  Another  320    I am dealing with this issue right now Fall  2001   The engine light is coming on and off again  I have not had this one checked out yet  I can t afford it  Ford will charge me  80 for a diagnostic test  Imagine how many times I have paid that Since the summer of 2000 my air conditioner has not worked  I cannot afford to pay for it  Perhaps later  Other problems continue to surface that become more important to repair  The blower switch only operates on the level 3  That gets pretty hot in the winter  I have to ride with the back windows down while the hot air blows into my face Please understand that  I keep all oil changes  For the last year I have been driving 20k per day  Before it was 80k per day  for about a year  I have paid for regular break work  tune ups and transmission checks  tire rotation  I have one cup holder  The car still makes a rattling noise underneath and makes a thumping sound when I am sitting at a light  I can actually feel the thump  And can someone please tell me how is it that the break lights go out so quickly  I would estimate that I have spent close to  if not more  than  4000 on this car since I purchased it  Everyone who knows me is waiting for that next event  I have 18 more payments left  I have decided to wait it out  Once it is paid for  I will be very happy  I am a single parent of 3 and this car is bleeding us  The sad thing about it is Ford does not seem to back their product  Once I get out of this  I will never step foot into another Ford even if the price is right  My kids will know the same when they get older  An entire generation will be anti Ford
