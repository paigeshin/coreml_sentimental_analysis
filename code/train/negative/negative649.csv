 I haven t driven an Escort since my 1993 model and now I know why  Our Ford Ranger XLT was involved in an auto accident a few weeks ago so our rental car is this 1999 Ford Escort  Now I ve owned a Ford Escort before  it was a 1993 model and after two blown headgaskets  a new radiator  major engine work and  1500 later  I traded it in for my first truck which was a Toyota 4X2 until I traded that in for the Ford Ranger  Now that you know why I am driving this Ford Escort  let me tell you about it b Dwarf Ponies or maybe mice b This little car may be economical  but it certainly is comical when it comes to the  horsepower  this thing has  To put it bluntly  it sucks on hills  You need to start hitting the gas pedal hard about 500 feet before you climb a hill or else it simply will max out and everyone is passing you b Park Place  We ve been driving this car now for two weeks  We have had to leave at least 5 to 10 minutes early so we can get this car out of PARK  The button that releases the stick is a crap shoot if you get it to push in so it will release the shift  I spent 10 minutes of my lunch hour yesterday trying to get it out of park  I swore that when I did I was going right to the rental place to exchange cars  They did not have any available  but the guy told me that if the shift would not move out of PARK to push this little flat black button next to the stick and it would release the shift and allow me to push the shift s button all the way in so I can move out of PARK  NOW HE TELLS ME b But there is a bright side  The car gets excellent gas mileage  In these days of high gas prices  it cost us  15 00 to fill the tank up and it lasted for a good 200 miles of mostly highway driving  Our Ford Ranger guzzles about double that  but it is a 20 gallon tank  but gets only about 100 miles more than the Escort b Price  As a rental  you can t beat the price  19 99 a day  As a first family car  I would also recommend it  In fact I recommend everyone should rent the vehicle they intend on buying for a week to see if it will meet all of their expectations  A simple test drive won t tell you how it performs in your daily lives and it is far better to spend that extra  50 to make sure it will
