 I have some bad news  and I have some good news  The bad news is that my car is in the repair shop with a leaking gas line  More bad news is I not only have to incur the expense of the repair  but I have to incur the expense of renting a car  as it s a holiday weekend and my car won t be done for several days  and I can t drive it like it is for fear that I ll blow up  Now for the good news  I guess  Just when I was cursing my car and thinking about buying another  the  Ford Contour  has made me appreciate my own vehicle  at least I know I will appreciate it once the repair is done There are three things I like about this 1999 4  door  Ford Contour  that I ve been driving for the past few days  one being the comfort of the driver s seat  two being a nice  cold air conditioner  and three being a fairly roomy back seat  My  Geo Prism  lacks in those departments  Other than those items I mentioned  I ve already decided I would never buy one of these  Contour s The first thing I noticed was how loud the engine is  My usual vehicle purrs in comparison  The sound system for the radio isn t as clear as mine  While I mentioned the air conditioner to be nice and cold  it has some drawbacks  too  It s rather noisy and no matter how you set the control  it s never just right  On low it doesn t operate effectively  and on the next notch it blows you away  noise and all  It s almost annoying to think about listening to the radio when it s on  The humidity was horrific in my city today  Usually  I just open the window  but today  I had to use the air conditioner  and  I ve got to tell you  if an ambulance or fire truck was in the area I never would ve heard its  sirens  The rental I have  which is the higher end model of the  Contour   i LX   does not have power windows and locks  cruise control  or ABS brakes  etc  so I can t comment on those  but  for what it does have  I m surprised to say that my  Geo Prism  gives a more enjoyable ride  at least a less noisy one  However  I d still opt to take a  Contour  over my car when going on a very long drive  because the seat gives much more support to my back than mine does This model  Contour  is equipped with driver and passenger front airbags  and has a decent looking instrument panel and dash  While giving a nice outward appearance  there is nothing particularly rich looking or feeling inside  nor does this auto have any outstanding features to write home about  and what surprised me the most  not even a cup holder The interior has blah grey cloth seats  Again  it s only a rental  so naturally I d customize it if I were buying  so I can t knock the choice of interior or color or features  I did notice something as soon as I rented it  though  and I mentioned it to the rental car representative  First of all  the side moldings of the car  which appear to be made of rubber  were the same exact color as the exterior  While there were no dents to the exterior  it was very noticeable that every scratch on it  whether it be big or small  had turned white  White against the dazzling emerald green is very noticeable  so I guess I d have to make a negative comment about the exterior paint finish  if this is the caliber one is to expect from a  Ford Contour   A good finish does not allow every hairline scratch to stick out like a sore thumb  As the  Contour  is bigger than my vehicle  I was disappointed to see that its  trunk was only slightly bigger  if bigger at all  than my car s trunk  The depth looked the same  so it amounted to the fact that you can probably fit two large pieces of luggage and no more if you consider the door hinges  They say there s a reason for everything  and a little good will come from something bad  I guess this is true because  while I was very disappointed to have the setback and costly repair and expense associated with my car s problem  I m glad I got to drive a newer car to see just what I was missing  While the  Contour  gives a nice appearance and a fairly smooth ride  overall  its  bad features outweigh its  good ones
