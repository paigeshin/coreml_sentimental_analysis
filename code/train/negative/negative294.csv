 Our family recently purchased a new 2000 Ford Windstar SEL and so far I have been very pleased with the purchase  which when you read on you ll understand that this is saying a lot We are a family of 4 with two boys 10 and 6  The wife an I both work outside the home and I drove a 1992 Ford Explorer and the wife drove a 1991 4 door Honda Accord  We love to go camping and we pull a medium size Colemann Pop Up camper when we are able to go  I was starting to have serious problems with the Ford Explorer  and we decided it was time to buy a new tow vehicle  After looking at other manly vehicles  Tahoe  Lincoln Navigators  Suburbans  etc  I just couldn t justify their cost and fuel mileage  Besides the wife typically takes the boys  and their friends  to recreational activities  so she would be driving it as often as I did  After some discussion  and believe me I was not an easy sell  we decided to look into mini vans as an option to replace the Explorer Needless to say  I swallowed my manly pride and we are now owners of a mini van  After looking into many different models we decided on Ford because they were offering 60 months  9  financing at the time on the Windstar and they came packaged with the best options for the price  We purchased an SEL model with leather  CD Cassette  dual A C  back up sensors  and power sliding doors  driver   passenger side  etc After owning this vehicle for 3 months now  we could be happier  yes me too  Gas mileage in town is been running 17 18 MPG  and 23 25 on the highway  It has plenty of power to pull the camper and plenty of room for kids and related sporting equipment  I am very picky about vehicles and this van has impressed me as being very solid and free from defects  I do hear quick and slight drive train grind when initially driving off after the van has been parked for a while  but it only lasts a split second and doesn t re occur until the van is stopped and restarted  The other annomily that I ve heard is the occasional sound of water from the A C dripping on the exhaust when going down the highway Finally  I thought that the power sliding doors was a bit too much when we first purchased the van  but after owning it for a couple weeks I realized just how conveinent that option was  No hands door opening  keeps kids from scratching the doors  ensures that they can get in even on hill sides  and makes it nice for putting groceries in when your hands are full  Oh yea  I now drive a 4 dr Honda Accord to work each day  quite a step from a SUV UPDATE  We had just returned home from a 11 hour road trip only to have the transmission completely fail while trying to take off from a stop light  It gave me no warning of any kind  just a large crunch when trying to accelerate away from a stop light  Get this  The warranty expired less than 60 days earlier and after the road trip the van now has 37K miles on it  Ford has agreed to pick up part of the cost but I m stuck with a  950 repair   Oh  yea a rebuilt transmission could cost anywhere from  2 200 to  2 800  The main problem is that Ford uses the Ford Taurse transmission in these mini vans  These transmissions are alread plagued with problems and when you add the extra 800 lbs of a mini van  it s just asking for trouble  If your debating the different mini vans  look beyond Ford and go with Toyota or better yet Honda  I ll likely trade mine in as soon as it gets back from the dealer  My advise  stay away from Ford products with FWD automatic transmissions
