 Being that I rented at least 5 of these babies makes me wonder has ford just totally and completely lost it beyond all measure  I don t even know where to start  lets go with Exterior  Exterior actually doesn t look to bad  I would even go as far to say that it actually looks sleek and somewhat sexy  The paint job is not very good though  I have already notice on many rental cars I have rented the paint starting to wear away in places  Which can be scary if you want to purchase a Ford Taurus  The headlights and taillights are pretty good no complaints their  Dashboard  It so obvious that the designing and quality stop right at the air conditioning vents  Considering Ford actually put a cd player in the car this time is quite surprising to me  Finally they step out of the 1980 s with the old cassette style  I found the radio controls and cd controls to be very confusing and on more then one occasions they have almost proved fatal while I was driving  Just to change radio stations is difficult while driving  Considering the fact alone that changing cd tracks in the car is close to impossible  Theirs a button for everything on the dash  A button for bass a button for treble for fade well you get the point  With all these buttons its close to impossible to figure out while driving what button to press to change the radio station or change cd tracks  It becomes almost a point of aggravation you almost feel like ripping out the entire dash at times  Anyway onto the drivers dash area  I find the dash board to be pretty lit at night with red glows etc  My major complaint is the fact you cant tell what speed your doing theirs more line and dashes then their are actually speed postings  So yet again another dangerous feature you will be studding the speedometer allot trying to figure out exactly what speed your going  Moving on to the passenger side  The Passenger side mystifies me totally  The passenger side Dash sticks out like 12 inches more then the Drivers side does  So the passenger will be pushing his seat back all the way just to get the maximum amount of leg room he can achieve in the passenger side  Bad side is in return the backseat person behind the passenger will become very cramp and will run out of leg room  Plus when your in the car this looks really stupid because the Drivers seat is not equal to the passenger seat in anyway  It makes the interior look completely uneven when sitting in the car  Also while where on the topic of passenger side dashboard we might as well bring up the fact that the passenger side dash is huge I mean my god its like something that came out of a horror movie or something the passenger side dash area literally takes up the entire passenger area  That includes the leg room area as well  What was ford thinking when they did this I don t know  Electronics  ABS  on some model  Cd player  radio  Driver Information how many miles to E  Average miles per gallon  how many miles done  Driver and Passenger side airbags  Cd player quality is ok the speakers could be allot better and I do mean allot better  Driver Information is nothing new ford should have done this years ago  Radio quality is good  IT comes with a trunk remote entry and keyless remote entry  Leg Room I find overall leg room in the car to be very poor  Infact the only seat that has the most leg room is the Driver seat and that is no joke either  Seat Comfort All four seats are at first comfortable but after about and Hour of sitting in them they provide very little support  So your thighs and your butt will start aching terrible Trunk Space The Trunk Space is actually pretty big and is probably the most major plus about this car  The trunk can hold two full size suit case one on top of each other and a travel suit case to the right of the full size suite cases and then it can hold some travel bins towards the front  It can hold a full size garment bag as well  So trunk space is deffintley good on this car Quality and Craftsmanship  What can I say the material is very cheap on all 5 I have rented the seats are already tearing in certain places  The whole car feels like its been put together by plastic  Also the car always breaks down  All 5 I have rented One I had the air conditioner fan go out  The other I rented the Engine believe it or not just gave out and the car only had 5 000 miles on it  I was just driving it down the road at 60mph and the all of sudden silence  I called AAA I told them it was a rental car  So they went ahead and picked me up and drove me to the nearest Hertz and I ask the Hertz if they could ever tell me what was wrong with the car  I was just curious the guy gave me his number and said call him up in about a week I did and he told me the shop quoted that the Engine had completely been shot he and I were surprised considering the car only had 5 000 miles on it  He said the car was covered by warranty anyway  So I was off in another Ford Taurus  This one was going well until The cruise control decided to quit and not work anymore  I tried everything to get it to work again but it failed to work  So after I was finish with business I return the car told them the problem  So I had another business affair I had to go on so Hertz yet again gave me another Taurus I was like what problem does this car behold for me now  Driving down the road I thought come on something gotta go wrong well a hour of driving went by and nothing happen  I was like men a Taurus without a problem  Well boy was I wrong  All of sudden when I went to do a lane change my blinkers weren t working nor was the wipers working either  This was not so good as because it look like up ahead it was going to rain  And I definitely need my blinker because I was coming into heavy traffic  So finally return the car to the Original Location and I finally stab another Taurus  This one actually had no problems  Expect that the engine kept making this knocking sound ever time I accelerated  Which concerned me a great deal  But some how it actually survived the trip and the return to its location  Personally I consider the reliability to be very poor  And ford should be very ashamed presenting a car like this to the general public  The car itself is ok at best if everything is working correctly  I don 146t know if I got a bad batch of Taurus or what  But these Taurus folks where cars with less then 10 000 miles on them  Personally I be very scared to buy one of these suckers in fear of god knows what going to go wrong with it  Maybe the breaks could fail that would be great  I wouldn 146t doubt it with the way the car was made  The Ride and Steering The ride is probably the big plus the rid is very smooth and very plush  The steering on the other hand is responsive but it always feels like it has a huge under steer which makes you feel like the car is going to lose it every time you take a steep turn  Overall I believe that if you really have to buy a ford Taurus buy one used and drive it around and hopefully the used one will have had all the quirks worn out before you finally get to it  I highly recommend that you don t buy this car  The 94 and 95 model Taurus Was Taurus best year and that more then likely will be their last best year  I think Ford should just scrape the ford Taurus or outsource the Ford Taurus to somebody that can really make it a fine car  Considering that ford lowered that engine models from 3 8 to 3 0 which makes the newer model ford Taurus always seem under powered  Ford is living in the past  I do believe Ford needs to take a real hard look at the foreign cars and start implementing what the foreign have and that also includes the quality to  I believe a better buy would be The Dodge Intrepid if you want American  If you want to go Foreign go for Honda Or Toyota Camry
