 This van is great for families who have several kids with lots of friends  It is safe and comfortable  but it has had MANY MAJOR reliability problems over the past years  and has NOT been driven that much  Seriously investigate reliability before purchasing  The options you have to buy to make this a decent car  power windows  locks  make the price uneccisarily high  Overall  I would not purchase this vehicle without some kind of statement guarantee additional insurance from Ford  But I must say  this van has tons of cargo room and seating comfort  especially with the captain seating option  We bought this vehicle to haul seven people around town  but we have used it for schelpping ping pong tables  trampolines  and more
