 I made a big mistake and bought a 1997 Ford Taurus SE  I used to work at a large Ford dealership and thought I still had lots of friends at the dealership  so I went there to buy my car  When I bought the car it had 28 000km on it  I thought the price was a good deal  but let me tell you it was no deal The car has shown well in safety tests  probably because its always in the shop and not on the road  and is quite comfortable and roomy in the front and trunk is large and can hold just about anything  Ford rates it as dependable and reliable  Well the people who rate the dependability and reliability of this model must not own one This car spends more time getting fixed then it does on the road  The dome light stays on whenever it feels like  the heater motor went 6 months after we bought it  the cable that runs form the steering column to the transmission snapped right after the 60 000km warranty ran out  There are power surges when you slow down for lights or stop signs  But the biggest problem is that the car has less than 117 000km and now the transmission has blown  Even though I know a mechanic that charges me less than the going rate for labor  this repair is going to set me back approx  3 000  with the cost of car rental for 10 days  I can say however that the car rides nice and smooth and the steering so far has been good  it corners well and does not shake and shimmy at speeds of 100km or more  This vehicle gets good gas mileage and does not burn a lot of oil However the bad out weighs the good  For a domestic car the repair bills are quite costly and the parts are not as easy to get as you would think  With the time is spends in the shop and the cost to repair  it just is not worth it When I spoke with the dealership one of the sales guys laughed at me and said that the Taurus is just not a good car  thanks for selling it to me Not only that but the place that my mechanic sent the transmission said that he already has 4 Taurus s 97 and newer that have the same problem Unless you like to spend a lot of money and love to read the magazines and check out the guys at the shop I don t recommend this car to anyone  I know that I will be unloading mine as fast as possible What the say about FORD  found on road dead or fix or repair daily  definitely applies to this model br br
