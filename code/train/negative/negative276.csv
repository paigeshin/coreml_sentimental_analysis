 I originally bought my 1997 with 25 000 miles Contour because it looked real nice  and it was very comfortable  About a year or so later I started getting noises from the dash  center console and some near the rear window  I have always loved Ford and have always bought exclusively from them but  this car has irritated me with it s creaks and clicks  After having it for over a year I am trying to trade it in  but the lots are starting to get an inventory of the  97 and earlier  Driving the car  I must admit is very fun  the handling is superb and with only a 4 cylinder engine it is pretty quick  Everything is real responsive  I am not sure about the later models but this one is a curse to all who hate noises as they drive  But if you can get a quite one then you will love to drive this car everywhere
