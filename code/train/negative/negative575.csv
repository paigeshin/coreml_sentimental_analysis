 After we got all our money back from our 1995 Mustang Convertible due to the Lemon Law in Florida  we used that money to order another new Mustang but instead of the white color we ordered the Laserred with the camel color top and interior  We were disappointed in the 1995 Mustang when the engine blew after owning it 8 days  it was brand new  and then the transmission went later We were thrilled with the car  6 cylinder  We drove it here  we drove it there  It s seemed like a nice car but typical Mustang  The pick up was sluggish  The seats were low and not comfortable  The cup holder was situated over the button that makes the top go up and down and the water dripped onto the button and I was waiting for it to short out some day On a hot day in south Florida with the top up  the a c didn t cool like it should because the sun beats down on the canvas top and there isn t any insulation so all the heat enters the car  There s no room in the back seat for people to sit  it is only good for either babies or double amputees  The trunk is small  The stereo average The gas mileage good  The convertible is easy to open and close  Our problem began about 12 months after owning the car  There was a vibration and we kept taking it in and they told us it needed to be aligned so they aligned it and it still vibrated  After months of going back and forth with the vibration and  600 later for new tires  they told us the tires were the cause and we purchased new tires  I told them that I had the torque converter and transmission and engine go bad in our other Mustang but they told me it wasn t any of that  it was in my mine  By that time I was out of my mind  When the service manager opened his drawer I saw a notice for Mustang torque converters and I asked him about that and he fessed up  The torque converters are bad and they have a quiet recall because they don t have enough torque converters to replace on all the Mustangs and they could only fix the ones with SEVERE problems  Again  this is the second Mustang with BIG problems  We had the car for 20 months and I wasn t about to go the Lemon Law route so I told my son we would buy the 2000 GT Convertible and trade this problem vehicle in  I had read that the GT didn t have problems with the torque converter  WRONG AGAIN  When will I learn  See my review on the 1995  amp  2000 Mustangs  Same problems different years  The Mustang is neat to look at  but a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT  If only Ford would build a good reliable Mustang I would buy one despite their MAJOR FLAWS but they don t  We now own an Explorer Sports Trac  Let s see how that goes br br
