 We bought this truck back in 1991 from a woman in our community  We got it with less than 80 000 miles on it at the time  Now it has nearly 170 000  Sure  it drinks  and drips  loads of oil and isn t very good on gas milage anymore  but that truck is made like a Timex  Presently it smokes from the wore out muffler and some other place on the engine  I have to ride the breaks when I m at a red light  and it never ever wants to start when it s the least bit cold outside  but my little truck is paid for and it s never let me down  With all of its problems it s never cost over  275 at one time to repair  Mostly it s just replacing of belts and filters  or adjusting the corborater  Since this truck has lasted so long with its problems  I would consider buying another Ford truck in the future  I can t really recommend the new Rangers since I know nothing about Ford s quality now br br
