 My mother has one of these monstrocities  and I drove it for the first time a few weeks ago  It was the most nerve racking experience of my life  Going from my small Toyota Camry to the Ford Expedition reminded me of the mock suv  the Canyonero  from tv s The Simpsons  you remember the theme song   quot fifty yards long and two lanes wide it s fifty tons of American pride quot  I love all the features on it  led showing  quot miles to empty quot  or  quot miles per gallon quot  six disc cd player  auto climate control  blinkers in the side mirrors  and room for seven comfortably  It was definately powerful  and the power steering was very responsive  but I couldn t stop worrying about hitting the car next to me or the curb  In short  if you are a very experienced driver and want luxury in an SUV  buy this vehicle  if you re even the slightest bit nervous about driving  get something smaller br br
