 Who wants one  ANybody  If you answered NO  give yourself a pat  and you can stop reading here  If you said yes  give yer self a kick in the butt  This sour lemon of a vehicle  oh where do I even start  How about puttin 2 pistons through the roof 4 months after I got it  Ok  I got a brand new engine  and since had no problems  Till a year later  I the jackass kept it The lemon would not start one day  So  I bring it to Ford   1700 later  I get it back running like new  2 weeks later  it rains  lemon would not start  I bring it to Ford   750 later  runs like new   Different problem  yea right It ran good for about 1 month  then it rained  I bring it to Ford   1200 later  runs like new  Next day  I went through a puddle  Not a lake  not a deep puddle  a little puddle on the side of the road  IT DIED  SO  it sat in my driveway for almost a year  rusting away  Ford explained to me many times  that each thing they did was a different part  and did not touch what they did last time  So  I had to pay all over again If you want to buy this Truck  my suggestions are Send Ford a check for your purchase price add on another  5000 for the repairs then just leave the truck at the lot so  it is not stuck in your driveway
