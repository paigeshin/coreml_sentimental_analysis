 We bought a 1999 Ford Expedition  We had previously had a 1993 Jeep Cherrokee and it turned out to be quite the lemon  I did my research and used Autobytel to purchase the car  I do think that by using this service we saved several thousand dollars  After looking at all the different Expeditions and driving the 4x4  we decided on the Eddie Bauer edition  The 4x4 was a VERY bumpy ride and it sits so high I could barely get into the truck  We have loved the size  we did get the third seat and it works well for children  BUT the truck is extremely bumpy compared to our old jeep and other SUV s  There is also a recall coming up about the windshield wipers  they go off all the time  I do not think we will get another Expedition when out lease is up br br
