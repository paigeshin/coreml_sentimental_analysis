 Well when I was test driving trucks I drove several late model compact pickups before finally decided on my 95 Ranger XLT  One of them is another Ranger  a stripped Base model I found on the same lot  At first  my parents thought  cheap  low mileage  let s go for it  So I had a closer look  This was a stripped  and I mean totally stripped  base model  No air  no tape deck  vinyl flat bench  manual everything  dough nut looking little tires  and that was pretty much it  There wasn t even any power steering  This was a barest of the bare bones models  designed to be a work vehicle  It seems like little trucklets like this one are the ones predestined from the factory to become those rough running 200 000 mile little rust buckets with springs that sag from constant overloading But my parents liked the price so I gave it a quick test drive  Well  what can I say about the interior on this truck  Well  it s a place where you sit  The vinyl floor isn t particularly attractive  so if you like quality looking materials look elsewhere  but it should be easy to hose out after muddy boots have made their mark  The numbers on the gauges are nice and easy to read  with the steering wheel made so the spokes do not block the view of the panel  The controls are simple  large  and easy to read  probably because there are no options so you don t have that many to clutter up the dash  The dash is the older square shape  before the interior was redesigned a couple years later  The plain  flat  rectangle and square shapes do not bulge and curve like the dashboards on later models  so everything is moved a bit farther away from the driver s reach and I found I had to look down more to operate the radio and heat controls  I missed the center armrest that usually makes it easy to rest your elbow while your hand works the controls  Did I mention no air  Or no tape deck  The am fm radio was tinny and fuzzy  But good enough to break up the monotony of lunch break at the construction site By the way I see more XLT s at work sites than strippers by far  Maybe even working men like their creature comforts The flat vinyl bench was  well  a place to rest your rear end  Not much more  Not designed for hours of comfortable cruising  just plain functional  There were also no headrests  which I find unforgivable in even the most stripped pickup made in the 90 s Then there was that power steering  Wait  no  I m confusing this with post stone age models  There was none  I ll admit  that s one less thing that might eventually break or require extra maintenance  but me and my parents ended up deciding it was worth it  Just try turning the wheel for the first ten seconds or so after start up before you get going and the steering warms up and effort gets lighter  I dare ya  With trucks like this who needs to lift weights  Just try maneuvering through a tight parking lot and you can get all the workout you need Handling was what could be expected with such a basic suspension setup  This truck sits low and is stiffly spung so it leans a little less that you might expect  but those puny 195 millimeter wide tires give out fast  And those leaf springs with a solid rear axle make for a nice dance number in bumpy corners  Ride damping was  well  truck like  Small bumps close together made it dance  The bigger ones were actually absorbed fairly well  just a solid  wump  with the suspension taking a good bit of the punishment before it reached the passengers  Of course  the really big pot holes gave me a headache  Sound deadening was probably another area where Ford did a little skimping  as the engine noise was ever present The little 2 3 4 banger does its job well in my truck  and in this truck it has considerably less weight to pull so I never felt like it lacked power  Merging into street traffic was pretty easy with the 145 lb feet of low end torque that motivates what must be a sub 3000 pound truck  Highway merging or passing are a different matter all together  You can do it  you just have to thrash this truck at 3000 rpm or maybe a little more  where it starts to get coarse and boomy  I don t recommend shifting below fourth at those speeds  but it gets tempting as it only pulls in 5th in ideal conditions and it only pulls in fourth over about 70 mph All in all  a work truck and no more  It does not presume to be a commuter vehicle or a highway cruiser  It is a work vehicle  to be used and abused until it falls apart  which should take quite awhile because of the lack of fancy extras or electronics that may be likely to develop problems in the future  If you absolutely have to have a truck and it s all you can afford go for it  with the reminder that this vehicle will not be much fun as a daily driver  Best left to those who need a reliable work horse OK maybe more like a work pony  and don t care about any options or frills  Me  I m quite happy that we paid a little more for my 95 XLT with 60 40 split bench and center console  tape deck  and rear sliding window  I strongly advise using some of the money saved by ordering the most basic power train and suspension for interior upgrades br br
