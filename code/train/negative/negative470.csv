 We have had so many problems with this van it isn t funny  The head gasket blew and was fixed before we got it thank goodness but who cares really with all the other problems we have had  what difference would one more problem make  On top of a ton of other problems  We had a check engine light coming on that was a cylinder 4 misfire code  We took it in had the spark plugs  wires  complete tune up and it didn t fix the problem  I took it to ford and they said that it was a head gasket problem  I decided to get a second opinion because we were not having any other symptoms of head gasket problems and the guy i took it to said that we didn t have the problem like Ford had told me and suggested a few other things  We first tried the coil pack and it didn t fix it  so we replaced the computer and it corrected the problem completly  I drove it about 500 miles and the oil light started coming on  flickering on and off  I stopped immediatly and checked the oil and it was not low  I went straight to the mechanic and he said that he thought the oil pan screen might be clogged   another  400 repair  and suggested I change the oil to a heavier weight to see if it could help first  The oil light went off and was fine for about 2 minutes and then the check engine light came on with a cylinder 4 misfire code  I drove it home and parked it for the night  The next day I was going to drive it back up and leave it with the mechanic and when I turned the key I heard a huge clunking scraping sort of sound and then nothing  The dumb thing wouldn t start  So I had it Towed to the mechanic and he said that he suspected a seized engine but will let me know tomarrow  It NEVER seems to run out of things to go wrong  I would DEFINATLY NOT recommend a Windstar unless you just like spending time and money at your mechanic for ENDLESS repairs   updated to say  that the engine IS locked  I am hardly suprised  I took it as a bad sign when we were looking to sell our van and 75  of them had either a new or rebuilt engine on it
