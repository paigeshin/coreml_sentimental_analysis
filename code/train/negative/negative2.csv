 My husband and I purchased a 1990 Ford F250 and had nothing but problems  we have owned the vehicle approximately two years and it has spent at least half of that time in the shop The first problem was the valve covers were leaking  This problem took three days in the shop  When we went to pick it up  we found that the mechanic at the dealership did not replace parts that he had to take off  This took an additional week  Because of the poor design  fixing this vehicle was not found to be cheap  nor could just any mechanic do the work Next   within one week  the serpentine belt came off the pulleys and sheared off the air conditioning power plug  This also took nearly a week to fix  Cause of this problem was unknown Next  the clean air pump broke  again within a week  This took about four days to fix  When I picked up the truck after the air pump  I didn t realize at the time that the mechanic had not hooked back up a hose to the transmission  So  after driving it for three days  my transmission needed to be rebuilt  Due to unavailable parts  a new transmission replaced the old  Which was mated to a junk yard transfer case  This repair took about 5 days Truck vibrates at about 70 miles an hour  so we spent  1700  on a new front end  tires  balancing etc  This did not help the situation Within two weeks the serpentine belt was replaced for the second time since I bought the vehicle  The truck had 98 000 miles when I took over so I expected some problems don t get me wrong  but newer vehicles are said too have 200 000 mile motor s I noticed a large loss of power after said repairs  then began the costly fixes and diagnostics to find cause of power loss  The gas mileage at this point is about 10mpg never increasing the belt replacement continued till the present date at a belt every month  The truck went into the shop again for transmission leaks to a ford dealership where the problems found mounted  Once again unavailable and discontinued parts This is not even close to being all of the problems  but I think I ve said enough
