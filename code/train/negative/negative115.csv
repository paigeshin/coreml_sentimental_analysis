 Have you ever written an opinion  only to have it be eaten by the server at the last second  I have tried to write this several times now  and with each revision  I get a little less amused I would up renting the Contour because my minivan was getting new brakes  The choices I had  about driving my van until the parts came in  no way  borrowing a car from a family member  haha  or doing without  led me to call the local U Rent It I was actually pretty pleased with the car  It fit the three of us well  there was an incredible amount of trunk space and I got really wonderful mileage  about 36 mpg  And then  as I revised  and revised  certain things began to stand out in my mind I am not a tall woman  I am not even five and a half feet tall  And yet  somehow  I managed 50  of the time to bang my knee getting into the car  I didn t need to readjust the seat or anything  it was back as far as it could roll  This is not a car for the NBA  Then there was the issue of the trunk  I like having space  but not at the expense of rear seat safety  The Contour has one of the folding back seats that instantly increases the trunk space  I am always afraid of being rear ended and getting a passenger impaled as a result  I don t trust the seat latches  Most of my driving was normal stuff  which is good  because the Contour does not have enough pluck to get you onto the Interstate and merging  Nor can it accelerate up hill  This might be a good thing if you are trying to cure yourself of speeding  but it drove me nuts  The ergonomics of the air and radio controls were aligned in such a way that I had to wait and read the buttons to see what was where  I don t like reading as I drive  The arm rest between the passenger and driver s seat was interesting  If it was down  you could not use the drink cups  or the storage  and it was so high that I felt like I was resting my arm on a plane level with my heart There are some people this is going to be a great car for  I am not one of them br br
