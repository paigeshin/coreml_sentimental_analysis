 I recently received a new 2002 Ford Windstar as a company vehicle  I have to say that this was an extremely bad choice  First off  the body styling is very boring compared to the rest of the mini vans on the market  The nose is long  the body is a box  and there are no accent lines to  spruce  it up  The interior is equally as boring  except maybe for the CD player  The rear seats are bench style and not bucket style as was in my Chevy Venture  This makes it difficult to get in and out  even for the smallest person  When removing the seats  you have to take the whole bench out  instead of simply one seat which is a headache because of the weight  I doubt that a mother of three could attempt such a feat  The space in the rear behind the last bench seat is non existent  I m not sure why it even exists actually  Should have eliminated the space  and backed the seats up a little bit for more leg room  If pushed  the engine is loud and sounds like its going to explode as it sucks down the 20 gallon gas tank in a matter of 350 miles  The ride is not bad  but the stereotype of driving a boat is in full force here  The transmission is a little choppy for a new vehicle  Can t imagine what it will be like at 50 000 miles  Ford was never known for their transmissions in the first place  The steering column seems to be a little off center in relation to the drivers seat due to the dash board design  The only pro I can see only applies to myself  and that is that it is a free vehicle for me  Unfortunately to all of you  you ll have to shell out 29 grand for this beauty  Do yourself a favor and shop around  I guarantee you ll find a better selection at a different dealer
