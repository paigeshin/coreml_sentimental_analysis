 We bought our 1997 Ford Taurus used in 1998  It had 10 000 miles on it and was the GL edition  Unfortunately we were looking forward to getting another Crown Victoria but none were in our price range  As a whole the car performs well  It started everytime you wanted it to and did great in the snow  While driving around in suburban areas the car is a dream  it s a smooth ride  quite quiet  and the car itself has no trouble  However once you hit try to go on the highway things get a bit shakey  In the beginning It seemed hard to get the car to cruising speed  Once at cruising speed things cool down a bit  but try to accelerate from cruising speed and the car will give out quite a shudder  This isn t the best car to be taking on long highway trips  Other than that the car will perform well  Next there is the interior  All the radio  A C and heating controls are in one area which makes it very easy to memorize  The dashboard is arranged in an orderly fashion  The seats are very comfortable although the drives seat could have more lumbar support  As a whole the interior is very roomy  There is enough room for me being 6 feet to sit in the front and my friend of the same height to sit in the back without us having our knees at our ears  Unfortunately much of the interiors moving parts were made of plastic which broke of when over used  As a whole this car was ok  I never got used to how many miles to the gallon you could get in the Taurus and the stuff you could fit in it  Although towards 70k miles this car started needing expensive repairs it lived through a trip to Washington DC and my Mother who runs child day care in our house and used it many times to transport them  For this cars performance i wish we had gotten another Crown Victoria we still our 1988 one which has 147 000 miles and still out performs the Taurus
