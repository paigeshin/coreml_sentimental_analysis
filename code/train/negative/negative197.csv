 We purchased our 1998 Ford Contour Sport GL with a 16 valve  4 cylinder engine in October of 1999  What attracted us to this vehicle  It was nearly new  it was in our price range and it was a pretty blue color  In addition  all of the literature that we read about the 1998 Contour was very positive  Performance  handling  and fuel economy were highlights of reviews  From what we read in the  Lemon Aid  book  the car represented excellent value for money  However  having lived with the car for the past 12 months  I m not so sure that all of the press that the 1998 Contour received was entirely accurate  I think this car would have rated as above average within its class  but my problem with this vehicle is a lack of confidence in its quality and safety  I will address all of the realities of the Contour  both good and bad  including the numerous recalls  and hopefully you will be able to better make your decision I would like to begin with commenting on all of the great things about the 1998 Ford Contour  First  this thing handles corners like nobody s business  It hugs those bends and turns  and what that translates to is a solid  secure feeling through the car and steering wheel  Who doesn t like to feel confident of the way their car handles  This vehicle is definitely above average in this regard  and this feature is possibly my number one favorite in the 1998 Contour Next good thing about the 1998 Ford Contour is its acceleration abilities  It does really well getting up to speed in good time  Whether merging on the highway or zipping in and out of traffic in town  this car can meet your requirements  I feel that this is important to note  as several people will shy away from a 4 cylinder as it feels like you re driving a turtle  I m sure the 6 cylinder just flies by comparison  but the 4 cylinder is far from disappointing in this regard  Lastly  our Contour is absolutely great on gas  We get excellent mileage  I m certain this is due largely to the fact that this is a 4 cylinder vehicle  and given the prices of fuel these days  this is definitely a  BIG  plus  Now  I have seen reviews that differ on this point  but they do not say if they are the 4 cylinder vehicle or the 6 cylinder  We had some diagnostics done earlier this year  and the results determined that we get about 13 5 kilometers to 1 liter of gas  Things could be very different for the 6 cylinder Contour  but if you are looking for an economical vehicle to operate  consider this vehicle an option  Now  onto other matters  Yes  the Ford Contour definitely has a dark side  Since we have owned the car  there have been 2 recalls  One to adjust the wiring for the airbags to ensure that they actually do go off when needed  and one to readjust something with the rear brakes so that they would not seize in an emergency  I know of one other recall to do with the headlights  but we asked our dealer and apparently that problem was resolved with our vehicle with the previous owner  So  well  there have been at least three recalls  Let s face it recalls are a little inconvenient  but stuff gets fixed for free  so who cares  right  Well  let me ask you this does the number of recalls reflect the quality of the vehicle overall  I think it does  As a result  I m not entirely confident of the quality of the vehicle  What else is looming in the future  Will be get the next recall notice  or will we be in an accident that leads to the next recall Which leads me to my big issue with the Ford Contour  and with Ford itself  Last Saturday morning as we were zipping along the highway  my husband and I immediately noticed a very strong burning smell  My husband is a diesel mechanic  and he said it smelled like burning wiring  All of a sudden   light gray smoke  starts pouring from the glove compartment and dashboard  My husband pulls over immediately  and we haul the kids out of the car in record time  My husband then opens the passenger door  pulls down the dash panel  and rips out the offending article  A plastic three way switch and the plugs that had been in it were totally fried  resulting in the wiring burning and the plastic socket burnt and melted  Fortunately  the car is determined still operable  and we are able to drive it to our dealership When my husband relates the tale to the woman at Ford  she is very understanding and sympathetic  She even goes so far as to tell us that she knows the exact problem they ve seen   quite a few b  She tells us that the problem will be fixed free of charge  We ask her   If this is such a common problem  then why hasn t there been a recall on the car  She then told us that usually something else goes before the problem gets as serious as this  so when the customer complains of the other problem  they fix the entire thing gratis  Ford has not determined the need for a recall as of yet  She must have noticed the stunned look on our faces  because she quickly said  But no one should have went through something like this  Hmmm you know  I think she s right   No one  should have to go through this experience  but people have  Quite a few people  apparently  So why hasn t Ford issued a recall to prevent another  possibly more serious incident from happening  Maybe this is like the Freestone Tire issue there has to be a certain death toll to make results happen  In conclusion  we had previously considered the 1998 Ford Contour a really good car  We liked it  We truly did  To me  it was a good car that handled well  had a peppy four cylinder engine  and was an economical drive  But now we have to ask ourselves b Do we have confidence in this car s quality and safety standards b  The answer is a resounding   No b  Frankly  I have also lost a lot of respect and confidence in The Ford Motor Company as well  I can t recommend this vehicle to others in all conscience  despite our previous level of content with this car  as their are just too many uncertanties and questions surrounding the safety and quality of this vehicle
