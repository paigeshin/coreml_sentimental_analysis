 We had owned a Dodge caravan but swore off them when the transmission failed at 70k miles  The Windstar styling appealed to my wife and the safety features  side airbags  back up sensor  were not available on other vans of that year  The van is used primarily to carry the kids to school  swimming  etc  Gas mileage is not great 15 in town 19 highway  The first problem we had was excessive oil consumption  The dealer fixed it under warranty  The problem was never fully explained but we also had to have an update to the computer  fuel injector cleaning and an oil change  Cost  350 Next the automatic side doors started sticking open  These were adjusted by the dealer under warranty  We passed on the  had to have  cooling system flush  tire rotation and oil change  Saved  300 At 34k miles I wanted the transmission checked as it appeared to take too long to engage when shifting from P or N to D  Ford said there was nothing wrong with it and specifications allowed up to a 7 second delay  We had to have another computer update  a transmission service and an oil change  Cost  350 At 38k the front brakes had to be serviced  Pads and rotors were worn beyond acceptable  We didn t use the Ford dealer for this  Saved  300 At 44k miles the lower tie rod ends had to be replaced  Cost  279 plus the  had to have  fuel injector cleaning  cooling system service and battery test  Total cost  500 but after complaining to Ford we got  170 refunded against the tie rods At 48k the mass air flow sensor and the master cylinder pressure  speed  switch failed  Plus another update to the computer  Cost  450 And finally at 50k the transmission had to be rebuilt  Cost  1800 Additionally there is always some little thing going wrong  the electric seat  the radio speakers  the rear wiper  etc I like the looks of the van but I will never buy another Ford
