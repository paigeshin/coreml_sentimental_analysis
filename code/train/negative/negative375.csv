 Back in 1997  we purchased a 1993 Ford Taurus Wagon  We purchased the car because we needed a larger car for our family  The car had problems the moment we drove it off the lot  As we were driving down the expressway in our  quot new quot  car  the Oxygen sensors went out  meaning the car would stall out going 65MPH  We called the dealership  and they fixed them  assuring us that the car had been very well taken care of  and this was just a strange coincidence  Well  2 weeks later  the brakes went out  so we got them fixed  Then the head gasket went out  And now the transmission is out in it  We have only had this car for a little over 2 years  and we have sunk more money into it than we had to pay for it even though we had a warranty  I will make sure a mechanic checks out the next car I purchase  and I would advice anyone to do the same
