 This car is great the first couple of times you drive it but then the buyers remorse kicks in  I have owned this car for over 1 year First the good things  This car is fast and has good power throughout the power band  I really like the nine inch wide tires and supercharger and the car drives great on the highway Now the bad things  Too many to list  but I will try Really cheap carpeting  no floor mats either Aweful interior  Very cheap 1980s look and build quality Leather quality is poor Post antenna is an eyesore Engine is very noisy  Very audible engine ticking and clanking Transmission gear noise  Thumping sounds when shifting Shifter is rubbery  and hard to find 3rd gear A good seating position relative to the shifter and steering is impossible to find Body panels do not line up at all Seating is below aceptable Lots of body roll  When you drive it  it feels like it is going to tip over  but it does manage turns good regardless Traction control doesn t work well  stalls out the car and causes wheel hop Very antiquated headlamp technology Have to bolt a license plate frame onto front  since bumper doesn t have it built in Exhaust note does not sound aggressive enough Rubber instead of polyurethane in much of the suspension Manual hood prop Plus  the premium SVT service you are supposed to get when you buy a Cobra is nonsense  I don t get any better service than someone who bought a Taurus  Ford still has not issued a recall on the ticking engines even though they know about the defect My first and last Ford
