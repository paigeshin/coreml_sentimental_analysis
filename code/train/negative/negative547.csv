 It seems as if Ford is still in it s constant struggle to produce a quality automobile  My Family and I purchased a 1997 Ford Explorer used from a dealership  The Explorer cost us roughly  23 000 and came with a leather interior and was almost totally loaded except for a sun or moon roof  When we bought the Explorer she had already lived about 33 000 miles of her nasty  painful life  After about a month with no problems  the brakes started to give us trouble  Then about a week later we realized another problem  You can only fit the little munchkins from The Wizard of Oz in the back seat  The cargo space however was very good  and if needed  the Explorer can be used as a truck  All of these things are very trivial  compared to the typical problem with Fords  that we encountered about 8 months ago  The transmission failed  However after this we were o k  The transmission failing once was not a problem  We got it fixed  and nobody got hurt  The true problem was 1 month after the transmission failed  300 miles since the 1st transmission failure  The transmission failed again  Many of my friends drive Explorers  and among the 6 or 7 that do  I have only seen 1 other case of transmission problems  and only 2 more cases of problems in general with the car  However  you can say why I must vent my dislike for the Explorer  We now own a Toyota 4 Runner  and it performs great  It is an excellent car and anyone who likes can read an epinion i wrote on that  If you can pay the little extra bit of money for the 4 Runner  then you will most likely save money in the long run  If you do however choose to buy an Explorer  get a long term extended warranty  because you will need it  If anyone would like more info on these 2 cars  then you can e mail me at Odoyell hotmail com
