 A Mustang is a wonderful all around sports car  It has been around since 1964  The early years i thin are still the best cars but some of the things on this new 2000 were on the early models  Such as the ring around the symbol of the Mustang  My friend has a 1997 Mustang Cobra with a mystic paint job  Can you say wow  Can this car win some awards  This car goes to almost 11 shows a year and has not gotten below 2nd place  This paint job is pretty smooth When the sun shines on the car it turns different colors such as green  blac  purple  blue it is relly neat looking br br
