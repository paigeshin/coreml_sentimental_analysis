 I am a former Ford salesman  Yea  I sold a couple of Windstars  but practicaly had to give them away  Before I go in to this I want to say that it did receive a five star safety rating  which is the highest a vehicle can receive  Very safe  well from the impact of another vehicle  I was particulary excited to show couples the windstars at the dealership because there were always high bonuses on them  I sold a windstar that was a new 1999 model still leftover from a year ago at  6 000 00 under MSRP  And I made close to a thousand dollars of commission off that one van  The dealership took a big hit  but they were losing 3  a month for just having it on the lot  That happens after the vehicle sits on the lot for over 90 days but over 120 days it gets ridiculous for the dealership to hold on to  So if you have to have a Windstar make sure you Don t pay for it  Thats just the point of view of a salesman  not a high demand now that SUV s are popular  Think about an Expedition instead Low rating because of lack of popularity br br
