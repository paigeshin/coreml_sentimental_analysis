 Remember back in the  70s when grocery stores came out the generic canned goods  They were quite popular and then were made fun of  I remember seeing an automobile painted in the familiar blue and white generic color with the word CAR painted on the side The  95 Ford Escort Wagon LX strikes me as that kind of car  In fact  the entire Escort line strikes me that way It s a CAR  Nothing fancy  certainly nothing very desirable  But it has four wheels and will get you from here to there It has been a fairly dependable car  although squeaks and rattles showed up almost immediately  For the first year I had that car in the shop quite often trying to nail down noises that I felt shouldn t have been there Still  it has performed reasonably well  if not exceptionally  It has little pick up  It is not particularly roomy  The ride is rougher than I like  Road noise is pretty loud  But it gets you from here to there  If you are someone who doesn t particularly care what kind of car you drive   just need transportation or don t have a lot of money   than this isn t such a bad car to own  But if you re looking for anything with pick up  style  room  or comfort  and quiet then the Escort is not for you br br
