 I bought a 1998 Mustang 6 cylinder in May of 1998  The car started out to be great  but turned into a  quot sour fruit quot  shortly after When I originally bought the vehicle  I tinted the windows and put an alarm on it only to find that the power window module was poking holes in the tint  After I had a couple of car full s of people  5  I noticed that the back shocks were not holding up the body of the car as well as it should  Not only that  but at 18 000 miles  the tires became bald  Also  after I was able to get used to the car  I noticed that the seat belts were not retracting properly  therefore leaving the seat belts hanging out of the car when I closed the door  The motor engine has been good so far except for this summer when the starter  alternator  and the battery gave out  All of the problems I had with the car SHOULD have been covered under warranty  But when I took the car in however they either said go to the manufacturer  tires  or we will TRY to fix it  in which case  most of the time it did not get fixed  I have been told by many people that you either love your Mustang or you hate it  I see it this way  If you want something different from everybody else on the road and something that can handle normal car  quot responsibilities quot  then do not buy the Ford Mustang  If you do have money to burn and you do not expect much from your car  then the Mustang is right for you br br
