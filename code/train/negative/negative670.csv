 Recently I had the need to rent a car  I picked the Ford Focus  I was amazed with this car  I liked it better than my own  more expensive 1999 Toyota Corolla LE  The steering wheel is not only height adjustable  but also telescopes  something you do not normally find on such a reasonably priced car  The drivers seat also adjusted forward and back and in height  nice feature for someone tall like myself  The front seats were roomy and comfortable and the back seat had I think the most leg room I HAVE EVER SEEN in a compact car The stereo sounded good considering it was stock  and the face of the radio has an upward tilt to it so that it is driver friendly  All the bells and whistles were located within easy reach and the air worked well In addition to having a roomy trunk  there are 60 40 split rear seats  Child safety seat anchors and shoulder harness seat belts for 5 passengers I rented the 4 door sedan  but there are 3 body styles  The 4 door sedan  4 door wagon and a sporty little hatch back  I have read the safety ratings for the hatch back and from what I recall it got 5 stars This car is definately on my list of cars to consider purchasing in the near future  you should take a look at it too br br
