 I drove a 97 Tbird on a long road trip in the winter of 1997  The type I had was a fully equipped V8 LX with every option available  This included leather  dual exhaust  moonroof  JBL audio  etc M overall impression of the car was favorable  but the sheer size of it makes it undesirable  Before I get to that  here are the plus points  First of all I simple LOVE the dash  The way it curves and wraps around the driver is something that is just amazing  It makes you feel extremely secure when you re in there  The guages and controls are easy to read and very logical in design  All switches and latches feel high quality Mechanically speaking  the car is a gem  The 4 6L V8 is a modualr engine that is found in other cars  i e  Mustang  so you can be assured that it is a tried and true motor  Service for it must also be rather easy to get as are parts  The 225 hp  with dual exhaust  it puts out are  quot push you in your seat quot  ponies that remind you that you have a V8  The taransmission is a little too conservative in that it forces you to floor it to reach redline in every gear  but fuel economy stays nice with that feature  The ride is smooth and quiet  Handling is typical for a big car  The rear end bobs and shakes a little  but absorbs road imprefections nicely  The rear wheel drive set up is also a huge plus point  FWD cars tend to be more expensive to service and require more services  i e  cv joints  Now the bad part  This design is basially one that Ford used since 1988  The first Tbird with this body and the 97 model are light years appart in refinement  but it doesn t look to be that way at a glance  Alos  big American cars tend to look really tachy after they age only a few years  I can t imagine spending over  15K on this thing and have it be a laughing stock of a car in 4 years  Acura Legend coupes would be a much better buy  even though they are FWD  Ford should be commended for staying committed to the V8 RWD personal coupe  but it s an idea whose time has come and gone  The reintroduction of the 2002 Tbird made to look like the 1955 model is simple a horrible attempt to retro a car  Using the Lincoln LS  which BTW is a import copy stolen Mitsubishi Diamante front end  BMW headlights  and Acura style front bumper  parts and rebadging them is in poor taste  I hope this car flops and Ford learns to stop selling  amp amp  to buyers  The story on the 2002 woudl have been different if they designed a V8 exculsive to the Tbird and REAL retro styling like metal dashboards  with airbags  huge white wall tires  and sealed beam look HID lighting systems  In other words  stop making cars look like jelly beans give the people FINS  and an exhaust that exits through the rear bumper br br
