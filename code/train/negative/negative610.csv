 That I am writing a review of this kind of truck is more or less an accident of fate I rented one for use on a project that required something with a little space for hauling electronic equipment around work sites  It looked pretty good   bright red  shiny it even drove well  Handling seemed adequate  and the v6 engine delivered ok performance  Crawling around the vehicle  out of curiosity  revealed that it seemed more maintainable that some of the more luxurious offerings in the truck classes by Ford  It looked like you could get at stuff under the hood  and the suspension running gear even looked truck like On closer examination  I decided that I really did not like the cab arrangement the addition of the little extra doors is questionable  There is no real body mass under the cab roof because of those doors  and my impression was that rollover safety is reduced  Behind the front seats there is so little space that all it would be useful for is to store stuff stuff like the flares and emergency road equipment that you might need  You certainly would not want to torture anyone larger than a small child by putting them back there The bed cover seemed a nice touch but the latches were not reliable  and you had to fiddle with them to get the lid locked down  And it did not take long to realize the disadvantage of the lid versus a cap   if you fill the bed up with stuff that wants to get higher than the bed walls  you can t close the lid  Payload is thus limited severely  Oh and it leaked The thing that really solidified my opinion of this  quot truck quot  was that one morning it simply failed to start  It turned out to be the security system  according to the rental people  when they arrived with a replacement for it and a flatbed to haul it off  It was apparently not an isolated case The Ranger appears to be another attempt by a major manufacturer build something that will appeal to people who want a truck  but are economy minded  The corner cutting makes the truck not really desirable if you want any kind of workhorse br br
