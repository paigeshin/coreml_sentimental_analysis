 In March  1999 I decided to buy a Ford Explorer Sport after thoroughly researching information on suv s in my price range  For the first month I truly enjoyed my new car  I like the power it has but not the gas it uses but I knew it wouldn t get good gas mileage and I was okay with that  But what I hate about this vehicle is how many recalls it has had already  among the other problems I ve had with it  One month after I bought the vehicle the back window shattered out while it was sitting in the carport  When the dealer fixed it they in turn screwed up the back wiper so I had to take it back in  I m glad I wasn t driving at the time  Then I got the recall for the secondary hood latch  then a recall for the cruise control  then a recall for the windshield wiper blades  because they would swish back and forth when you used the turn signal and sometimes even when you didn t use the turn signal  Last week I had to take the vehicle in because it s running rough  It sputters then very quickly accelerates when taking off from a stop or backing up and the transmission feels like it s slipping  When I picked up the vehicle I had to go to the service person and ask them to explain the receipt  He told me that the problem could not be fixed as it is under investigation by Ford  They don t know what s causing the problem and until they do they don t know how to repair it  Once they figure it out they will be sending out  another  recall  That means I have to drive this vehicle with it running the way it is until then  It s embarrassing to be in this V6 SOHC vehicle and have it sputter so bad you can hardly back out of a parking space  then have it catch and fly out of that space I don t think anyone should buy this vehicle
