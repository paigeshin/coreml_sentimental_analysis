  NO ONE b b Introduction  What was Ford thinking when they designed a four door car that is capable of 143 mph Obviously  when their fastest Sedan is just as fast as their mid sized engine sports car  they ve done something wrong  The designers of the Contour should have looked less at the engine and suspension and more towards comfort  interior  exterior  airbags  headlights  While the designers of the Mustang should have at least tried to compete with Chevy s race oriented cars b Pros  Ford knows how to do paint  it has a beautiful paint job If the headlights didn t explode  they put out adequate light  and the fog lights work good for daytime I guess for a mid priced sedan  this thing moves pretty well  0 60 in 12 seconds  Its agile too  with very little body flex in sharp turns If you really want one  resale sucks  so you ll be able to get a fully loaded 1998 model for  10 000 Ok  that is it for the pros b Cons  The headlights and airbags were recalled  The headlights explode  The airbags  won t go off in a crash   The cruise control will get stuck on   resulting in a crash   The throttle cable may fray  not returning to idle position   resulting in a crash   The rear brakes may lock up and refuse to unlock   resulting in a crash   If you own one of these cars  take it to the dealer immediately to get these things repaired  Thats only the first two years ownership  god knows what will happen when Ford quits recalling and they start exploding like Pinto s On cold mornings  sometimes this car refuses to start  Battery problem  sensor problem  I don t know  It starts fine when it is warm b It seats no one comfortably   maybe people who stand five feet tall and below  on a recent trip with four adults  each and every one complained of being cramped  The seats are almost comfortable  maybe if there was more leg room  they d be bearable The dash board is a joke  I m used to dash boards where you can put things  this one is sloped towards the front seats  and anything and everything placed on the dash board will eventually fall  This is so the airbags don t throw anything into you if they go off  But don t worry about it  they  won t go off  Ford has to stop trying to make their cars and components look like their emblem  Ovals do not make for good climate controls  nor do they flatter the exterior of this car b Road noise is terrible   Vibrations at freeway speeds are horrible  never mind trying to go faster than that  it feels as if the entire car is going to fall apart  After an alignment  it got a little better  but didn t go completely away To change the oil  you must drain it directly onto an exhaust manifold  which  of course  smells very bad until it all gets cooked off  The muffler is welded to the frame  which will make any replacement expensive  The radio antenna is motorized  which makes for a nice  clean look  but once that servo goes and you know it will  it will be a pain in the butt to replace  or it can probably be rigged so that it is always up  since the CD player won t even work unless the antenna is up The gas mileage averages at  25 mpg   with a  2 5 Liter engine   that is obviously ridiculous  a friend with a 1997 Sebring has the same size engine  and averages 33 mpg  on occasion getting as high as 36 b Overall  This car has been deeply effected by the  quot b Driver Returns On Foot  quot  syndrome  it is about time Ford removed it from their line up  It was nothing but trouble the day it came off the assembly line  The model I speak of was a  1998   which is a  refined version   I would have hated to see a 1997 or before model of this car  they probably have a lower life expectancy than the Mustangs at 2 5 years If you really want a family car with some pep  get the Impala SS or an SUV with a 4300 Vortec which will keep up just as well and afford better gas mileage If you really want one and are set on getting it no matter how bad it is  e mail me and I ll pray for you br br
