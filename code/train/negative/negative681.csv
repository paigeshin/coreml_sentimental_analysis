 I have had my ford focus since February of 2000 and have not been satisfied with it at all  I have already been to the service center 2 times and will be going back next week Since my parts had to be special ordered  I have needed brake shoes a new passenger seat belt  and my radio hasn t worked in months  I believe that the stereo was supposed to be one of the biggest selling features of the Sony limited edition model  Well It has only worked properly for around the first two months of owning the car  I normally by foreign cars and have for years now  but I decided I wanted a change  I have regretted it ever since and Can t wait till it is paid for so I can trade it in  There is no way I will make it through the next 5 years with it  I just don t see it being reliable  Like I said earlier I ve only had mine for approximately 8 months and I ve already needed brakes  That s pretty scary  I wouldn t recommend buying one especially not from Sam Galloway  I m not impressed br br
