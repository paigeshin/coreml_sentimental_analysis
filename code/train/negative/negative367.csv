 Okay  I m 19  and I ve been driving this death trap for 3 years  previously it was driven by my mother  so nothing you read is because of abuse  at least not long time abuse I have to say  anybody who says this is a good truck is so completely wrong that you might as well not read the review at all if they say so  It is an AWFUL truck  What s wrong  Hmmm  well  that begs the question  where to start Handling The truck actually isn t an awful handler  but body roll is severe  and it really bucks over bumps  Dive  the front end going down when braking  is terribly pronounced  Squat  the front end going up under acceleration  is not bad  but that s more a factor of the anemic engine than the suspension  On road  at the speed limit  the car is adequate  However  as I had the car when I was 16 and stupid  I know what it will do at more than double the speed limit  and that is feel like it s going to tip  On easy or moderate off roading  the Explorer is alright  however  on severe off road conditions  it falls apart  The truck bucks violently and generally feels like it s about to break Performance Well  the engine is a 170 horsepower V6 in a 4000  lb  truck  It accelerates slowly from any speed  and highway merging must be done at full throttle or you risk endangering people in the right lane  I did a few mods to the truck  a  performance   ha  airbox  a dual exhaust  and a chip  I d guess it had 180 horsepower after all that  Maybe 185  Anyway  nothing you can do  short of an engine swap  will make it accelerate fast  Even after all those mods  the thing couldn t even squeal its tires in a straight line  unless it was raining  And it s not just the engine  The brakes on this truck are awful  made even worse by a capricious ABS system which will activate in the dry  going less than 10 mph  or not activate at 40 mph when it s wet and causing the car to go sideways   I could see straight ahead through the passenger side window  All in all  even if you expected a poor performing vehicle  this one sucks Exterior I personally don t like the slab sided  blunt ended  aerodynamics of a brick look  but hey  that s subjective  Objectively  it isn t helping fuel economy  My truck was also purple  so that may be a small factor in my point of view Interior The main problem with the interior is that  like many Detroit products  it isn t well built  Plastics screwed onto plastics screwed onto metal is a great recipe for squeaks  and the Explorer definitely evinces these  The seat belts also rattle against the doors  and almost all interior trim panels can be wiggled by hand  and mostly pried away from their mounting surfaces  The cargo pad  or whatever you want to call it  is attached by velcro to velcro fasteners which are glued onto plastic  These gave way within a few months  so now I have no cargo pad  And both passenger side air vents are broken  because Ford couldn t be bothered to make them out of metal  so they were constructed from cheap  flimsy plastic  like most of the inside  The seats are fairly comfortable  and there s enough room for 4  5 s a stretch  and the middle rear seat absolutely sucks because of the always trying to retract lap belt that locks as tight as possible  Why couldn t it be adjustable  Because Ford motor company hates you  The mirror in the driver s side visor is also broken  because my mother put the window up when it was sticking out  That WAS partially her fault  but why couldn t Ford install some sort of stop on the thing  Because Ford is run by fools Reliability Well  it hasn t been good  With 80 000 miles in 10 years  you d think the radiator wouldn t have blown  You d also think the visors wouldn t be cracked and falling down  and that the car would get better than 14 mpg  maybe 20 if I had a lighter foot  The thing always has something wrong  Lately it s been the power door locks not being powered anymore  and the center console working it s way loose so I can shake it about 3  in either direction  this of course is another example of plastic screwed onto metal  which just destroys the plastic  giving it the play  The vacuum lines have all decayed  so they had to be replaced  The shocks were also replaced because the car was rolling  diving  and squating too much  Then I realized the shocks were fine  because the new ones didn t control body motions at all Misc One thing that really bugs me about the Explorer is that it has absolutely almost no safety features  No airbags  no traction control  no stability control  only pre tensioning safety belts Overall All in all  I hate the truck  My view is slightly skewed because my parents had Mercedes  and BMWs and wouldn t even buy a newer Explorer  but hey  the truck really is a poor choice for anyone  Please  don t get suckered into buying one
