 The vehical I own is presently out of commision so my parents are letting me use thier 98 Ford Windstar  I am very greatful for them loaning it to me but  what a lemon  The inside light and dinger does not go off unless you are going 15 mph or faster and if you get below that speed limit  the interior light comes on and the ding ding ding chirps as loud as can be  I ve taken it in to be looked at more than once and the dealership always gives the van back saying  quot the problem is fixed quot  Maybe I should be gripping about the manufacturer but thats not the only problem  the ride is really smooth as long as you drive 70 mph or more  the seats don t lay down  they fold  which makes it impossible to use for camping  I would have never puchased this automobile  I wish they would hurry and fix my car
