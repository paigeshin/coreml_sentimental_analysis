 We originally leased a 1998 Ford Windstar and LOVED it  We then turned it in at the end of the lease and bought a 1999 Windstar anticipating we d enjoy it also  HATED IT  First of all  it doesn t look as sleek as the 98  Secondly  it sometimes rides like a truck  not a car  After the wonderful experience of the 98  I don t understand what happened with the 99  It doesn t have as much room as the 98 either  The good thing is that it does have rear doors on both sides now  The bad thing is that you can only enter the second rear seat from one side it would be very helpful to enter from both sides  Also  there s no longer a door lock for the automatic lock at the rear door  The sound system is good though  You should buy this vehicle if you have never had a mini van before  you will love it because you won t have any comparison  Also  it does ride well after the 1st 5000 miles and it s great for long highway trips  And for the money  it s probably one of the best values you can get  Even though I don t love the car  I will say it s not a totally awful car  If I had never purchased the 98  I would probably think it s great  It has done great in safety tests br br
