 Wow  Out of curiosity I started reading the Taurus reviews  They only confirmed my suspicions  I think the Taurus tends to be a lot like a cocker spaniel  If you know cockers you will find they come in good and bad  It seems they have two very different temperments  Laid back and affectionate would be type one  Nasty and very apt to bite is the second type  With the Taurus you have the dependable joy to drive car  and also  the  Found on Road Dead  type My  91 Taurus couldn t have been a better car for me  We did have a period of unreliability due to a bad alternator  It took 3 tries to get an alternator that would work for more than a day or two  but that can happen with any car  After that  it was clear sailing all the way  I really can t say too much bad about this car at all I bought this  91 Taurus in  95 from a dealer We paid  10 000 for a nicely loaded car  It had all the options I could have wanted  My favorite options being the automatic windows and seats have continued to work well  needing no repairs as of yet  Now that this car is almost 11 years old I couldn t really complain too much if things started to go although  I hope it continues to hold up for awhile  This is absolutely the most comfortable car I have ever driven  I am just under 5  tall and still I need not worry about sitting on a pillow or anything stupid like that  I have had that problem with other cars in the past  The automatic seats adjust all over the place making it easy to get a comfortable fit  Also  they are very easy to adjust even while driving  I like this because if you start to feel cramped  tired and uncomfortable you can just move a button or two and the change of position eases the discomfort right away The body of this car has held up well  We are very bad at keeping it washed and waxed and it is just now starting to show some rust  We are also very bad at managing to get the oil changes on time  Still the engine is doing fine  Nothing has really broken down on this car  We did have to replace the knobs recently that work all the heating and air conditioning settings  They just seemed to wear out and fall off a lot  The only really annoying thing we had a problem with is that the trunk had a tendency to pop open while you were driving down the highway  We did manage to correct that problem  Now  I feel safe and secure when driving this older car around  It has always been very reliable  I never had any problem with getting stuck anywhere due to a car problem As good as this car has been  I am starting to get a little worried  I do know a lot of people that have had nothing but trouble with the Taurus  and we are some of those people  We also have a  93 Taurus that I hate  It has been just as unreliable as the other one has been reliable  There is 160 000 miles on the Taurus I love and a lot less on the other car  It really shouldn t be in the condition it seems to be in  I have heard that they tend to die about the time you hit the 100 000 mark  I do know that several that have done that exact thing  I am beginning to get nervous about driving it because of the record of some of the others  I want to buy a new car soon  or a  new for me but slightly used  car  I would love to have another Taurus but because I keep hearing bad stories about the Taurus owned by others  I am leary of doing this  I must make up my mind soon  If I don t get another Taurus I plan to try to find a car as similiar as I can to the Taurus  It is the perfect size and shape for me
