 I would have to agree that the ownership of the Ford Taurus was not much fun  I had one for a few years and rarely drove it  Yes  it was a comfortable car  but it had so much problems  I ll tell you what kinds of headaches this car has caused  Until it s ultimate death at just a little over 100 000 miles  I ve had the front brake rotors replaced twice  an engine that overheated 3 times  electrical shortages  a whining and moaning steering rack  and the unbelievable  the subframe on which the engine is assembled fell to the ground  Of all the monstrosities of owning an unreliable vehicle  as my brother was driving it one day  he noticed that the steering locked while in motion  He hit a pothole and discovered that the engine suddenly fell on to ground  I ve never heard of such a thing  It really did happen  Being already out of warranty  we went to a local Ford dealer to see if this is normal  It turns out there was a recall on the subframe connectors or mounts  They fixed it for free  minus a  quot Metallica quot  CD one of the mechanics decides to steal from the back seat  I couldn t prove it  After a while  the Taurus developed this engine surge at all rests  either at a light or stop sign with the brake pedal applied  It was unexplainable to a mechanic  so we tried to live with it  Eventually  the surges would increase in intensity and eventually stall the motor  It s eventual demise came when I took a road trip to Florida from NY  On my way back to NY  it decided to finally die  The transmission blew at 105 000 in the middle of Virginia  In the meantime  my brother and I had to hitch a ride back to the NY  Not much fun
