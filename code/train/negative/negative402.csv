 This vehicle was a nightmare  My wife and I bought this car in June and it is falling apart  So far  now at 5300 miles  the following has had to be replaced Wheel bearings Wheel mount Struts Fuel pump Brake rotors and pads They have also worked on the driver s side window mechanism and the engine  The car still makes the rotational grinding noise and popping when in a turn or over a bump  We bought this to replace an older car so we would spend less time in the service department  but look what happened  Save your time and money and purchase any car that is not made here in the US  Our quality of workmanship is horrible in US factories  Caveat Emptor
