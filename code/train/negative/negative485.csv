 After researching different types of small to mid sized cars earlier this year  I decided that the Ford Focus was definitely the type of car I wanted for myself  It was only a little bigger than my old car  a 1989 Dodge Omni  it had a ton of fun new features  and it seemed pretty reliable from the information I could find on the Internet about it  So  after applying for a new car loan from my bank  and finding the Focus I wanted from Carmax s website  I went in and bought myself a new car P P I was excited  I had all these new features  and a bigger engine to play with  My car came stocked with power windows  power door locks  AM FM radio  a CD player  and the new Ztech engine we had heard about  I was very proud of this shiny new car  showed it off to everyone where I worked  took my friends and family on test drives to show how great this car was  and recommended Focuses and Carmax to everyone P P And then  the first problem hit  Almost a week after we bought the car  on the way home from work  the check engine light came on  When I pulled into Carmax  I was brushed off by the service department there  and told that they wouldn t be the ones fixing the problem  it was still under Ford s 30 000 mile warranty  I was surprised to hear that  as when I bought the car  I bought it with Carmax s MaxCare warrantly as I ve had my other cars in for service there  and have been very pleased with the level of service  I was unaware that there was any warranty under Ford  I didn t even know American car companies offered them  but figured the people at Carmax knew what they were doing  and had them call up our local Ford dealer in Leesburg  VA  The next day when I picked up the car from Jerry s Leesburg Ford  I was told that a sensor had blown  that they replaced it and everything should be fine  They were right for about three months that is     Our first sign of trouble occurred on September 11  2002 when I was driving my husband back from his eye doctor appointment in Reston  VA  We were driving home  and the transmission seemed to slip  Having driven an old car for most of my life  I just thought it was a normal thing and brushed it off  but that weekend it got worse  After going to our local mall on Saturday  September 14th  the car decided to throw us for another loop  As we were driving down the road  the transmission started slipping again  more violently this time  and the interior and exterior lights started to flicker on and off  We got the car home as soon as we could  given the traffic around our area  and the next day took it out for a test drive  since Carmax   the dealer would not be open again until Monday morning  to see if we could pin down what was causing the problem  We drove it for about 30 minutes  so that the car would be warmed up  and then as we were driving by WorldCom in Ashburn  the problem started again  We hadn t done anything to cause a problem  but slam on the brakes when a bird flew out in front of the car     The next morning  this would be Monday  September 16th  we took the car to Carmax again as they still had not sufficiently explained this unknown Ford warranty to us  Again  we were told to go to the Ford dealer as Carmax wouldn t touch it  So  I called into work telling them I would be late  and we went over to the Koons Ford in Sterling  VA to drop the car off  I got a call from them later that afternoon telling me that the service technicians were unable to find any problems with the car and could we please come in for a test drive the following morning  So  my husband and I got up extra early that Tuesday  this would be September 17th  and went on a rather lengthy test drive with the technician  and still the problem did not occur again  At this point  the technicians were being extremely helpful  and said that if we didn t mind having extra miles put on the car  the technician would drive it to and from his home in Front Royal that evening to see if it occurred during his drive  The next morning  still nothing was found  and we were forced to pick up the car that afternoon with no resolution P P  Surprisingly though  the car behaved alright for the next couple of days  and didn t exhibit any more signs of failing until Saturday  September 21st when the car started doing the same things it had done to us on Saturday  September 14th  except that it was also making the gages on the dash go up and down making it look like we were doing 120 mph at a stop light  Luckily for us  the Koons Ford service department was still open that Saturday afternoon  so we drove the car in as it was breaking down so they could visibly see what it was doing  The service department at Koons took the car in right away  and about a half hour later  we were told that the car s alternator was dead  So  we waited until about 5 30 p m  as we were promised they would have the car all fixed up by the close of business that afternoon  and went to go visit Matt in the service department  He told us that the car wasn t finished yet  and offered to give us a loaner so we would have transportation until we could pick the car up on Monday P P  We picked up the car Monday morning  and it drove wonderfully until Friday  September 27th  I was driving with my husband to our local Enterprise car rental agency  so we could pick up a rental car for that weekend for a family get together  when the check engine light came on in the car again  Clearly upset  I drove the car back to Koons Ford that morning and demanded they fix the car this time  They took the car in  and later I was told that another sensor in the engine had blown  but it was fixed  I picked up the car on September 30th  and again the car seemed fine for awhile  and then it started doing the same thing it had been doing back when this whole thing started     On Friday  October 25th  on the way home from my husband s oral surgery  the car s transmission started slipping  the interior and exterior lights blinked on and off  and all the gages on the dash shot up and then went back down to normal  Since my husband was still somewhat sedated  I decided to wait until the next morning to take the car to Koons Ford  That Saturday  I took the car in and told them to call me when they had it fixed  About 4 00 p m  on Saturday  October 27th  we received a call from the dealer telling us that what was wrong was a loose ground wire and they fixed it and the car was ready for pick up  It sounded plausible  so we piled into one of our friend s cars  as my husband could still not drive yet  and picked up the car P P  Again  the car drove ok for awhile  I ran into a little difficulty on Wednesday  October 30th on my way to the National Zoo from work while I was sitting in traffic on the Beltway  but I thought it was just my imagination  and tried to convince myself that the car could not be breaking down again after all of that  Well  there s only so much you can brush off because on Saturday  November 9th  the car started exhibiting the same exact signs as before  And as before  we drove it straight back to Koons Ford in Sterling to be fixed  I just got a message on my voicemail at work this morning that they can t find anything wrong with the car  but they will check again today  and see if anything shows up     So  my shiny new car that I was so proud of back in May has turned into my worst nightmare  This is unfortunately not the first time I ve had this kind of trouble  I had a 1995 Dodge Intrepid that cost us a lot of money in repairs  but this Focus only has 23 000 miles on it  I can t even imagine what horrors await me when it hits 50 000     I would only recommend the 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 to someone who doesn t plan on driving it much or who wants to learn how to fix some of these newer cars  This car has proven to be very unreliable for people who need a reliable car to drive to and from work and take care of their family  The car looks great  and when it works  it drives like a dream  but who buys a car to have it in the shop all the time
