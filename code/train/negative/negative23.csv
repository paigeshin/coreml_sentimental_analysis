 I thought it was odd that the front and back brakes as well as the rotors all went out before hitting 20K miles  Also  we had to call the CEO of our local dealer because their service center said that the factory warranty wouldn t cover the cost  The repair bill was  550 00 but the CEO saw it our way after much arguing  and we didn t have to pay it  I guess they didn t like us too much  because when we picked up the truck  there was bird poop all over the inside of the truck  and it had a flat tire  We owned a 1997 F 150 Offroad prior to this one  and like this truck  the window mechanism on the passenger side tends to go out early on  This truck has been in the shop 3 or 4 times since we ve had it  not quite 1 year old  just the deal with the brakes sucked  The radiator had to be replaced at 5K miles  and the transmission was leaking fluid like crazy too  It is a comfy truck with a lot of room  looks good  but the reason I won t buy another is simply because of the service  the crappy way we were treated
