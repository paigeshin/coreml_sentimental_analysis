 When we found out about our 3rd pregnancy  we also found out that our nice Explorer had to go  Why  Because our 3rd pregnancy was resulting in our 3rd and 4th children yep  twins  We looked at several used models and finally settled on a 1995 Ford Windstar GL  It had less than 30 000 miles on it and had been a rental model for the dealership so we felt fairly confident it had been serviced properly  But alas  this was not to be  During the time we owned our Windstar  it came under various recalls  Each time we took it in  it wouldn t be properly repaired and the recalled item would have caused more damage to the engine that would not be covered  resulting in money out of our pocket  It drove fairly well more like a car than a van  But the steering ratio was horrid  Although we were told the van was the  quot largest among the minivan class quot  we soon discovered this was not interior space  As our kids grew  the van became smaller and smaller  An adult could not comfortably squeeze into the 3rd row seat at all  Door latches broke  power windows malfunctioned  cassette player stopped working  And that was in 2 years of ownership  In fact  our Windstar was traded in for our new Dodge Grand Caravan while in the shop for yet another repair  Ford says its improved the Windstar  I hope for the sake of consumers out there putting their trust in them  they have  As for me  once bitten  twice shy br br
