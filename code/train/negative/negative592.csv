 The Ford Explorer is not the biggest SUV  but it is too big for me  I cannot stand driving in it for many reasons  First  it is a very flimsy car and a collision with anything larger would mean my death  Also  it has horrible suspension which makes listening to cds impossible because of all the skipping and every ride is very uncomfortable  The gas mileage  although good compared to an expedition or excursion  is much worse than I would hope for  It is about 13 miles per gallon city  18 miles per gallon highway  With the gas prices as high as they are having a car which guzzles this amount of gas is killing my wallet  Finally  despite the atrocious size of this behemoth and the trouble I have in finding a parking place for it  it is still impossible to fit into  It has room for five people  if you and your friends don t have legs br br
