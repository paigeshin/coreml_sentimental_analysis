 I recently went on a trip to Kentucky and I had to rent a car  I wanted a mid sized sedan but the rental office didn t have any  so they decided to  quot upgrade quot  me to this little car  I won t call it a sports car because it lacked the performance I would like in a sports car  and it was nothing compared to my Monte Carlo SS  even when it was all stock  I guess you can t compare apples to oranges though  the Mustang did only have a V6  which had less power than my Blazer s V6  First I will start off with what I liked about the Mustang  I did like the way the exterior looked  It was quite stylish  with its angled curves  and fake ram air ducts  I also liked the sterio  it looked better than the ones in my Chevy s  but did not put out the sound like them  It came with a fairly decent package  It had air  cruise  power windows and locks  a tape player  and a CD player  I also liked the cruise control on the steering wheel  it was much easier to get to than on my Chevys which have it on the turn signal switch  That is about all I liked What I didn t like  which proves my theory that Fords are made very cheaply  is the abundance of plastic parts in the interior  The doors were about 99  plastic  which made it very uncomfortable to rest my arm on it  It was cold in the mornings  and when it got hot during the day my arm would stick to it  The dash was also all plastic  and did not look good at all  Every part of the car that I touched felt like it was going to break if I put any pressure on it  Next is the lack of power  Now I know it was only a V6  so I don t want a million comments telling me how I should drive a 5 0  or a Cobra and see if my opinion changes  I have driven a Camero with a V6  and I am not being at all one sided toward Chevy here  it did have much more power  I tried to spin up the tires a little on the Mustang  and the only way I could was by doing a brake torque  The Mustang was not a bad car to drive  but it just wasn t a sports car  The ride was very bumpy  and when cornering  it felt like you are going to lose control  It had the sports car look  but not the sports car feel  I think I ll stick to my Chevy muscle cars and trucks for now  my  85 Monte SS is 10 times the car the Mustang is  Thank you Ford once again  the Mustang turned me completely off of buying a sports car br br
