 I own a 99 new Ford Explorer Sport for about a year  I already had 3 warranty repairs and that s a brand new car  After 6 weeks the ABS module broke which also caused the odometer and the speedometer to fail  It took my dealer 4 visits to figure out that the ABS module was the problem  A couple of weeks later one of the rear safety belts broke and last week the motor of the rear end wiper died  Then there is still that rattling noise close to the moonroof which no dealer was able to find the cause of  Also there were two recalls by Ford  After getting that fixed  suddenly my wiper come on whenever I turned or gave a turning signal  This has stopped as suddenly as it appeared  Maybe I got an especially bad assembled car  but it makes one wonder about the quality assurance at Ford The Explorer Sport is a really nice car if two people are riding in the car  To get to the back seat is kind of hard  The cargo space and room that the Explorer provides is great  It is easy to load big stuff into it  I have the Comfort Package with the 6 way power driver s seat which is really great if two people of different height use the car  It is very easy to adjust the seat and it provides a lot of  quot fine tuning quot  of your seat s position For the looks of the car I would definitely recommend the Premium Sports Package Driving the Explorer on a bumpy road is like riding a camel  very shaky  When turning on wet streets the rear end of the car is skidding which doesn t make you feel very safe in it  When making longer road trips on a highway it is a very comfortable  nice to drive car  I still love my Explorer  sometimes it s a love hate relationship  but I would not buy one anymore nor would I recommend it to anyone br br
