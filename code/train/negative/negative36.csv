 I had and lemon lawed a 1996 Mustang GT Convertible  Cute car   extremely good looking  Driving it was awful  Front end shook  brakes wouldn t stop  Ford did not stand behind their product and  instead  implied it was all in my head  Yet they had no answer as to why the brakes failed while I was driving it  They couldn t answer why 3 different dealerships refused to do anything about my complaints  They never checked the brakes further then to look at them  They never tested the lines or anything else  They insisted my front end problems were tire related  yet I had 3 different sets of tires on the car in the space of 2 years   the final set had about 9 000 miles and were practically bald down from 19 000 on the first set  which still is less then Goodyear s 25 000 suggested mileage and I drive my cars baby like I do not beat on them or do anything such as that that would wear tires down prematurely  I had 2 Trans Ams prior to that Mustang GT and guess what I got after I won the lemon law case and Ford had to buy back the car  You guessed it   another Pontiac Trans Am  We won t even mention the fact that the Mustang GT doesn t come anywhere close to the T A and Z28 in horsepower  I could get the same horsepower in a 6 cylinder 4 door car  i e  the 300M  that Ford is offering in their supposed  quot sports car quot    I consider the Mustang GT to be a sick joke  Every time I was at Ford there were NUMEROUS Mustangs being brought in for repair   too many to make it worthwhile br br
