 In 1992  I bought my first car  and it was a 1981 Ford Escort  I just wanted a little car to drive around town  get groceries  take my son to the doctor  etc  without having to rely on public transportation  It was a little rough around the edges   it needed a new muffler and brakes  but other than that  it was fine It was a standard transmission  and since I had never driven one before  I had to teach myself how to drive it  It wasn t that hard  and soon  I was driving it  in my opinion  like I had been driving a stick shift for years  I only had it for a few months  and then gave it to my father when I got married  My husband had a car  and my father needed a car  so I gave him mine  Sadly  though  the little Escort only lasted through one more cold  Canadian winter  before my father sold it for junk  All in all  I didn t have too many problems with this car  but it was 11 years old when I got it  so it had been through it s good times  If I had to get another older car   I wouldn t get a car that s 12 years old   I would consider getting a 5 or 6 year old Escort  It was great on gas  very economical  and an okay first car br br
