 About a year ago I bought a Mustang GT to fulfill a dream  As many others  I always loved the mustang  Finally I was able to buy one  I was very lucky because I found one that was only driven on the weekends  The previous owner took really good care of it  Everyone thought I had bought a brand new car  I wanted to buy a stick shift vehicle but This vehicle was in such good shape that I opted to buy it even though it was an automatic  A decision I have lived to regret  More on that later  Driving this vehicle is awesome  Lots of power even for an automatic  The seats are comfortable and the layout of the inside is shaped somewhat like a mini cockpit  It handles great in dry weather and handles better than expected on rain  DO NOT DRIVE ON SNOW  Take the bus  I love the rumble sound that comes out of the dual exhaust  I love the looks you get when you drive it  I love how you can blow away most of these little Honda cars that have all kinds of work done to the engines and they still sound like lawn mowers  Don t get me wrong I love Honda cars I think they are the most reliable but not most powerful  Yes the mustang is a great muscle car  But that is it Now for the negatives  For starters the gas mileage is unreal  18 Miles to the gallon if you drive like a retired old person  If you drive like a 16 year old you are looking at about 10 miles to the gallon  The automatic transmission died and had to be rebuild for a whopping  2000  The Idle sometimes is too low and the car shuts off at stop lights  This is only a rare occurrence  The windshield wiper relay function works only on occasion  The ride is super rough  I live in NY and the potholes here are unreal  And in a Mustang they feel like the grand canyon  There is virtually no head room and no back seat room  The windshield is small and you will find yourself looking around the rearview mirror  The tires are expensive and don t last too long  so many little things I could go on forever  I do not comprehend why Ford continues to build vehicles so unreliable and with so many defects  One would think they would have improved the quality by now and maybe have some pride in building their cars  The bottom line is this is not a car but a toy which has to be taken care of greatly and can only be abused on occasion  I would recommend having a small reliable Japanese car that saves lots of gas so you can have that for everyday use and drive the mustang only on the weekends  It will last longer and save you money in the long run  I personally will never buy a ford vehicle after this experience  Even though I kind of love the Mustang and don t really what to give it up  I am looking into buying some little Honda for everyday use
