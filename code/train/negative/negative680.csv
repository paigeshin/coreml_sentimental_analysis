 Four recalls   mayor recalls Squeaky wheels from the get go A strange tremor when the car goes slow Leaking on passenger floor Electrical problem with a speaker Not even a year old And I am not even going into the little stuff And Customer Service  Third World Attitude Extremely rude  must suck to work for Ford Misinformed No loaner cars No effective repairs They are really working hard at getting rid of their current client base Why is the American public still fooled by Ford Thank goodness I leased because had I paid to own this car  once the warranty goes  I would have to be paying every other month for one thing or another  It is scary  The car is impressive at first  but I would like to know how many people out there are applying for the lemon laws on this one
