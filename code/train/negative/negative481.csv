 I used to drive a 88 Full Size Bronco Eddie Bauer  I then took some vacation time in Colorado and decided to rent the Expedition  Compared to the Bronco  I HATED the expedition  It s a larger truck but inside it doesn t feel like it AT ALL  The parking brake constantly dug into my shin  It didn t handle NEARLY as well as the Bronco did  but thats not surprising being that it IS a larger vehicle  I even wound up sleeping in the vehicle one night and found it quite frustrating that 1  the seats don t recline enough to sleep in very well and 2  with the design of the rear seats  there is no comfertable way to sleep in the back  It s also too luxurious  I can t stand what car companies are doing to these trucks  If you want luxury  buy a bmw  if you want a truck  don t expect it to look and feel like car  Although I must say  my 88 bronco was able to outhandle my friends 97 VW Golf on dry roads which I proved when I wound up pulling him out of the ditch  br br
