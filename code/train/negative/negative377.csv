 In April 2000  I purchased a 1993 Taurus LX Wagon with the V6 engine  My family was growing  and I needed a larger  safer vehicle  I went the way I could afford  It was priced slightly over the Blue Book price  and it was super clean  The odometer read nearly 120 000 miles  but when I test drove it  the Taurus wagon handled well and rode smoothly  It ran quietly  and shifted almost unnoticeably  I was impressed  as was my wife  which was very important I made a  1 000 down payment and financed the remaining  3 700 through my bank  The first monthly payment was due on June 1  2000  Roughly 40 days after the purchase was made  a couple weeks before the first monthly payment was due  I had a problem One morning while pulling out of a parking lot  the transmission slipped out of gear  And it stayed that way  The mechanic told me that when he opened it up  the case was full of shavings  Totally without warning  the transmission had chewed itself up  A remanufactured transmission with a decent warranty cost me  2 100  Add to that over  500 in labor  All for a seven year old vehicle I still owed nearly  5 000 on when interest is added Also  at the consignment lot  the keyless entry code worked  A few months later it didn t  and it cost me  45 to get some guy with a slim jim to open the car for me
