 All in all the van has proven to be dependable  Lots of little annoying things went wrong  The most serious was that the large sliding door quit opening  I have not had that fixed yet  Tape player quit working along with the remote radio panel  Bought the van in 96 and all these quit in 98  Power mirrors don t work now  AC fan went out last year  All these except for the large sliding door seem small  Front end hard to keep inline  but Arkansas roads seem to help that  Motor is still strong after 121 000 miles and mechanically I would not be scared to drive this van cross country  It would take alot to fix all the little things wrong to make this a real nice van again  Plan on trading soon No problem with motor or drivetrain  Put starter on last year br br
