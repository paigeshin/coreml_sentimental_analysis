 Ok  So my title is sort of a rip off from a funny movie but when I think about the Ford Aspire I had  that title is stuck in my head  I bought a 1996 Ford Aspire  I still can t tell you the exact color of it  It was a purple blue  It depended on the light outside or lack of  I should have been warned right there that maybe this car wasn t one to buy  Even the dealership couldn t name that color  The price was affordable  It matched my budget on payments  I thought it was kind of small but since I drive a lot  I didn t mind because I knew I d save a lot on gas money Reason one to hate this car is that it is small  While the seats in the back fold down to make more room if you want to carry something large  there really isn t that much space in the back  When the seats are up so you can have passengers in the back  the area in the back  this is a hatch back  no trunk  is very small  I discovered this after I tried to fit a few things in it after I bought it  There wasn t room  I couldn t fit a golf bag in it without it stick up  My wife couldn t fit the playpen  folded  in it  The large stroller we own for our child wouldn t fit  We usually had to put some of our groceries on the floor of the car because all of it wouldn t fit in the small back space  Also  we had problems shutting the hatch back  Sometimes it didn t want to shut  Sometimes when I hit a dip in the road  the thing actually popped open  I was less than pleased Reason number two to hate this car is the lack of power it has  While test driving it on surface streets you won t notice it  It handles surface streets great  It s when you get on a highway or freeway that you notice  You can put your foot to the floor trying to merge with traffic going over fifty miles and hour and still not reach that speed at a decent pace  I ve almost been in accidents because of this  The car just has no get up and go  Reason number three to hate this car is the wheel is hard to turn when you are doing U turns yet the brakes are super touchy  You can barely put some weight on the brakes and they tend to almost lock up  This you can adjust to  which I did  but I wasn t real happy about it  The steering I also got used to but my wife refused to drive my car after a few times  She felt it was too hard to steer  While some might think the wife not wanting to drive their car is a reason to buy it  remember reason one and two Reason number four to hate this car is that when you travel any distance in it  the car seems to shrink on you  While you might frown about this because we all know cars don t really shrink  I know that  it feels like it is  After an hour or so on the road you realize just how much of a compact car this is  The seats aren t real comfortable after an hour behind the wheel either  It doesn t bother you at first but after an hour  you start to feel it in your back and behind side  Reason number five to hate this car is while traveling you really notice the flaws about this car  While driving in the mountains you are going to experience power loss on the way up  Traffic will start passing you by even though you have your foot to the floor  There just isn t any power in this baby  While driving in the desert I noticed that the car doesn t do well in extreme heat either  You buy newer cars so you don t have to worry about them breaking down  I was worried in this car  Reason number six to hate this car is that since I bought it I ve had to take it into the shop four times  I had to take it in the first time because the brakes needed work and they were new when I bought it  They lasted less than a year  I was told that they see Aspires in often for this  The second reason I had to take it in was it was overheating  The third time I had to take it in was because while driving on the freeway I could hear a bad noise coming from the wheel well on the passenger side  I had to replace the front axal  It was cheaper than paying for a new joint and boot  which was the problem  The fourth time I had to take it in was because there was something wrong with the transmission  I could feel it slipping  Reason number seven to hate this car was paying the huge bill that came with all four of those repair bills Reason number seven to hate this car  and I blame this one one the dealership I bought it from  was the alarm that came with it  It was a cheap alarm system  It was the kind that locks the ignition so no one can drive away with it if they break into it  The alarm was a real piece of junk  Someone could smash a window  steal everything in the car  and it wouldn t set the alarm off  One day my battery for my remote died and I could get into the car but I couldn t get it started  The alarm didn t even go off when I tried to start it  The system worked fine that way  The car wouldn t start  I had to call AAA thinking I d just have it towed home  borrow the wife s alarm remote  and go replace the battery in mine  When AAA showed up the guy just shook his head at me  popped open a panel under the dash  and pushed a button  The alarm shut off so the car started again  All anyone ever had to do was break a window  pop that panel to push a little button  rip out the ignition  and take off with my car in less than a minute  I was a bit furious over this fact Reason number eight to hate this car is that it only comes with two seat belts in the back seat  There is room for a third one but Ford must have really wanted to cut corners when they made it  There is about fourteen inches of space in the middle of the backseat that is totally a waste of space in that regard  Would it have killed them to put in a middle seat belt  I guess so  They sure didn t do it  Reason number nine is the total lack of comfort the car has and functions  Mine was one of the better models made  I had air conditioning  It didn t work very well  The ashtray fell out or jammed up when I tried to use it for a change tray  The glove box is an actual glove box  That s about all that you can fit into the tiny thing  A pair of gloves  I wanted to upgrade the stereo system but realized that again they had really made this car compact  I had a hard time finding a unit that would fit in the very small space provided  When I did try to buy one and have it installed  the people just shook their heads at me and explained that they would have to do a lot of work to remove the factory installed unit and get a new system in  This adds to your normal bill  They assured me that the wiring was a nightmare as well  Reason number ten is looking back at the other nine reasons and knowing that I paid too much money for this car  regretting buying it in the first place  and having to go out to find another car  I no longer have the Aspire  I couldn t wait to be rid of it after having it for just over a year  I also want to mention that the trade in value of the car is painful  It sure hurt me realizing exactly how much having that piece of junk for a year had cost me after they deducted what I d paid on it to that point  deducting the trade in value  and adding that remaining balance to my replacement car  It was a costly mistake that I made buying it  I don t recommend this car to anyone unless you feel like buying a car for someone you don t like who you feel needs one headache after another and a sore backside after a long road trip  Maybe I should have given it to my Mother In Law  LOL  Just kidding  I can t think of anyone that I don t like enough to wish that car on  I have always loved Fords  I bought another Ford  It s just that Ford made a mistake in producing the Aspire  It s the Pinto of the 90 s
