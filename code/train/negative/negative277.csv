 Bought a 1997 Contour Sport V6 5 speed with 58 000 miles on the odometer in 2000  Thought I got a good deal  I was wrong This car came completely loaded   power everything  leather interior  fog lights  etc  Unfortunately  this car proved to be about as reliable as your average Yugo  I had this car for all of 25 000 miles  yet I had to replace the water pump twice  the fuel pump  the rear main seal on the engine  a  1 000 repair  and I sold it when it needed an  1800 emissions system repair  This car only had 83 000 miles on it when I got rid of it  yet the resale value was terrible  and just about everything on the car had failed  My opinion of this car is that it is a complete piece of junk  Avoid at all costs   spend some extra money and buy a Honda or Toyota  The Contour V6 is fun to drive when it runs properly  but is it not nearly as quick as advertised  the 170 hp V6 seems pretty weak The manual transmission is very slow  and the low end torque is minimal  This car may seem like a bargain when you first look at it  but look a little deeper  Mine needed  1800 in emissions system repairs when I traded it in   and this was at 83 000 miles  Do you think a Honda or Toyota would require repairs like this at 83 000 miles  Found On Road Dead is not such a bad acronym
