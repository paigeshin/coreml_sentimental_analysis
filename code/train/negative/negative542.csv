 this vehicle is as good a car as any but not the greatest  I have borrowed my fathers 97 ford explorer many times for long trips or lengthy city drives and for these purposes it is fine  It is roomy and comfortable inside  it offers a seperate set of controls for climate and music aside from the front seats set  he chose leather seats which i personally do not care for so much but it also has a range of adjustment buttons for the front seats which can be nice  There is a temperature gage and direction indicator near the rearview mirror  His has a 6 CD holder and a tape player and a large area in the back for storage and such  I think this vehicle though was built from the inside out  They either were too concerned about minor inner details or put them all there to cover up the real problems  It seems he has had so much little troubles here and there and he shouldnt really have any at all with as new as it is  When the air conditioning runs in the summer  when you are sitting at a light you can hear it running poorly with a repeated tick in it  i have personally never been able to figure out how to convince the cruise control to operate  A mysterious breakage of a handle near the driver seat occurred and blame was placed but never accepted  It seems to me that they forgot to screw all the bolts in this vehicle tightly enough and while you are dazed and fascinated by all the pretty gadgets on the inside  there is chaos going on outside it seems to me that he also had problems with the driver window or maybe it was the MPH gage  when they went to fix it  they gave it back and it suddenly randomly began chanting that his door was ajar I think for the reputation of ford and the price and year of this ford Explorer  he should have had another 3 5 years At LEAST before little problems began appearing  That was not the case though  I would recommend if you are considering this vehicle  you may want to consider a few others as well  get any available review  reports and test that have been done to this vehicle br br
