 I bought the cheapest American made I m a patriot  so sue me  truck I could find  and it is a Ford Ranger with no options save the am fm stereo  which I begrudgingly accepted As far as automobiles go  I would consider myself an audiophile  and car audio is the major concern that leads me to think negatively about this particular truck  For some reason  Ford insists on using 5 quot x7 quot  speakers in many of their light trucks  The reason this is a problem is because aftermarket 5 quot x7 quot  speakers can be hard to find  Even harder to find are top quality speakers in this size arrangement  All that can be circumvented by inconveniently using the incorrect size for the available speaker mounting  Of course  unless you really know what you re doing  Mr  Car Stereo Installer will charge you around  50 to make sizers so that they fit properly That is just the beginning of the problem  Unlike many other trucks  the Ranger has almost no room underneath the seats  What this means is that  short of a minor miracle  you can t place an external amplifier anywhere but behind the seats  This arrangement creates another problem  If a subwoofer were to be installed along with that amplifier  the entire jack assembly behind the seat needs to be removed  Due to this  my jack is now underneath my passenger seat  Not a real problem  but lets say another amp were added for better fidelity and volume  two amps and a subwoofer enclosure are almost impossible to fit behind the seats in this narrow cab  This is where the underseat space comes into play  because with many other light pickups  an amp could be placed under either seat  facilitating greater flexability in the setup behind the seat   such as two subwoofers or a subwoofer and a pair of 6 quot x9 quot  enclosures Now  I realize no car truck is perfect  However  a new car should be relatively problem free for the first year in my opinion  Inside of the first 6 months  I experienced the following problems  Straight from the dealer  the plastic molding on the right front pillar wasnt installed properly  The interior light for  ironically  the lighting controls ceased functioning  The dashboard developed a persistent  and very annoying  creak  The seat developed a slight tear  And  lastly  the wheel alignment went astray to the right  The conclusion that I have to draw is that the Ranger is not the most rugged of vehicles  which is a bit disappointing  it being a truck and all  Overall  the vehicle has not been a vast disappointment  The gas mileage has been right where the sticker said it should be  I have not needed to have any routine parts  such as headlights or turn signal bulbs  replaced  The suspension is a bit bumpy  but that s to be expected from a truck  The power steering works great  although  on my particular vehicle  the right tire rubs against the wheel well if the steering wheel is turned completely to the right  The manual transmission is tight  and the engine produces good pickup for a 4 cylinder  The tires that come standard with the vehicle are terrible on anything but dry pavement  My final analysis of the Ford Ranger is that it is a servicable vehicle  but nothing I could find myself recommending to a friend  or waiting in anticipation to buy
