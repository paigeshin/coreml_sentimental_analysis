 Perhaps  quot junk quot  is too strong a word to describe my 2000 Ford Taurus Wagon  After scanning some of the other Taurus reviews  I may be too harsh  but I honestly cannot recommend this car  I realize that this is not a high priced luxury car  so I guess I can muster two stars considering the car s price range I obtained this car about three months ago  and it has about 2500 miles  From the first day that I drove it  there was a problem with the brakes  Whenever I brake the car usually pulls dramatically to the left  and sometimes it pulls to the right  Like most people  I have a busy schedule during business hours  and it is not convenient for me to make an appointment with the dealer to have this fixed during work hours My next problem is the amount of road noise which gets inside the car  I rent many cars each year  and this car is definitely above average in the noise department  On a recent business excursion it was difficult for passengers in the front seat to hear passengers in the back seat and vice versa  due to the road noise  Again  I realize that this is not a luxury vehicle  but I think Ford could do better I would also like to have a larger gas tank  The sixteen gallon tank should be enlarged to a twenty gallon tank  in my opinion  My car gets about 18 miles per gallon  so with the amount of driving I do  I have to stop for gas about twice a week  I do not think that a larger tank would take much away from fuel efficiency  The fact that the gas gauge takes about 20 minutes to register after the car is filled up took some getting used to  as well There are a number of puzzling aspects about this car  For example  why isn t a third pull out seat standard in a station wagon  I know that it is my own fault for assuming that it would be  but now I am stuck with a station wagon with no third seat  Also  why is the rear windshield wiper not centered  The portion of the rear windshield behind the driver is not reached by the wiper  Why does the cruise control have so many buttons and require two hands to operate  I prefer the simple GM system which only requires one hand  Why is the steering wheel so enormous in the center that you cannot see the instrument panel when you make a turn  Other vehicles manage to provide airbags without obstructing the panel view  Speaking of obstructions  why is the driver s head rest so huge that you cannot see around it  Is it me  or is the road clearance unusually low on this vehicle By this time you are probably wondering how I wound up with this car  This is my company car  and it is the only  quot choice quot  that I am given  I realize that this next annoyance may only apply to other fleet car drivers  but why does Ford throw in a  1000 plus engine upgrade to allow the car to run on ethanol  I live on the east coast where ethanol is not readily available  I am sure that it has to do with some sort of government quota  but I would have much rather had the extra thousand dollars put into something usable I usually like to be more upbeat when writing reviews  so I concentrated and came up with two features I like on this car  There is a nice thin shelf directly under the radio console  I also like the fact that there is a second electronic adapter for electronic devices  although this is somewhat standard now br br
