 I had this car given to me as a rental from Enterprise  I had for one day because that was as long as I could deal with having it  I m used to cars that have a little up and go  So when I drove this car I was fairly upset with it  I went and a trip to another city which was about 90 miles away and it was the worst trip I had ever made  A diesel drove past me and I almost got sucked into it  It was awkward to drive and man was it ugly  The only good thing about this car was that it did have air conditioning and a tape player  It also got excellent gas mileage  But  man  what an ugly car br br
