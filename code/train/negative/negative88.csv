 In August of 1997 I  Russell  turned the age of 16  My parents told me I could have any car that was available to my choices on the lot  no special oredering my dad said  So as a 16 year old getting his first car  a new one at that  I was very estatic to look at my options  I knew that I either wanted a mustang or an explorer  Well my decision was made  The explorer was mine  After about 3 months of having my SUV  my check engine light decided to come on  As soon as that happend no more than 2 hours later i took it to the dealership and it took them 2 weeks to fix it  It needed a tune up already  Well in mid March my Mach 460 radio system  factory  blew  The dealership did not want to fix this saying that it was my fault  And needless to say my sunroof stopped working  my leather seats started to tear  and keep in mind  I kept very good care of this car  VERY GOOD  she was my baby  I do not think i liked anything about this car after having it for a year and a half  Driving this car was an unbelievalbe experience  Everybody where I live wanted to drive it  It was easy on the handling  very aggresive  and super fast  If you think that this was just a lemon then buy one  on my opinion i have 3 other friends that just have gotten new ones in the past year and they have done the same  I would not recomend this vehicle to my worst enemy  Now however Ford has come out with the Ford Explorer Sport Trac  this car is better by far  I have had mine for about 3 months now and she has gave me NO problems at all  I recommend the Ford Explorer Sport Trac  NOT the Ford Explorer Sport br br
