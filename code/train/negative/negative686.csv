 It s a good car  a great concept  and a faulty execution Okay  it has a lot more room than one should expect in a compact design  It probably saves more gas than it uses  and it is light years ahead of its predecessor in style and design Yet  it has some true flaws 1 NVH   noise vibration and harshness   come on guys  compare this to the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic   it needs a more refined engine 2  Manual transmission   if a 4 cyl engine is going to properly perform  it needs to marry its transmission  not just shack up in a drunken stupor for the evening  The stick shift on this car is baulky  with a heavy feel and a lack of convincing precision  Once again   learn from Honda and Toyota Insufficient road isolation   understandably  it s a small 4 cyl car   yeat more could be done to make it more than a 2 hour drive  I wouldn t want to do the cross country thing with it br br
