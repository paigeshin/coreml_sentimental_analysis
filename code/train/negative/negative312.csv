 I will be upfront with you from the beginning and tell you that I am not a Ford fan  But that has nothing to do with the opinion I am about to write  My family of 5 traveled to Hawaii for a vacation  We had reserved a mini van on the Big Island  Of course we didn t know what we d get  we were willing to take whatever they gave us at the rental agency  Ford  GM  Toyota  whatever  Well  they gave us a Ford Windstar  which was fine  When we walked to the van  it was a nice looking van and we thought this would be a nice experience to get over some of our dislike for past Ford products we ve had bad experiences with First problem was   we couldn t even fit all of our luggage into the  hatchback  area  some of it had to go into the back seat with one person sitting there  Yes  I know we could pack lighter  but believe me  we were within reasonable limits  Had no trouble getting it on the planes  in fact we didn t max out our limits there   Next problem was the first time the driver opened the drivers door he wacked himself on the head because the door kind of curves down and in  making it so you have to pay attention every time you open the door  No stitches were involved but he did have a nasty looking cut for the duration of our trip Next problem is that the middle seat in the back doesn t go all the way to the  edge  of the vehicle  like the Astro or Safari s do  so the adults who were riding in the middle seat had difficulty getting in and out comfortably  and when you are sightseeing  there is a lot of getting in and out And my last complaint has nothing to do with Ford  but we had to laugh when we left the rental agency in Kona  flew to Honolulu to rent another van for a week and got another Windstar  We asked for something different but they didn t have anything available  Since we d already paid for it before our vacation  we didn t have the heart to walk away and try a different rental agency I do know that in the future I won t rent  or buy  a Ford Windstar There were some good points about it  Like I said at the beginning  it is a nice looking vehicle  it does drive nice and I particularly liked the rear controlled air conditioning br br
