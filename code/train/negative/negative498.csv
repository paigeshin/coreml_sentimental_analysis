 I bought my Aerostar 1992 from a friend about a year ago  with over 110 000 miles  for a 1500 bucks  He sold this van because he disliked the van Comparing to toady s new minivans  the Aerostar is far from the good minivans  Makes big noise at driving  Steering wheel makes also big noise at each turn  Rides very bumpy  It s not comfortable to drive long trips  Toady s new cars   minivans are very smooth  The Aerostar is not  Braking is also poor  All passengers are feeling that I m braking now  If you don t wear seat belts  you almost fall down when braking  When I stop  at a traffic light  etc  the van shudders and shivers Also the power windows doesn t work fine  I have to push it down with my hands  to  HELP  the power  The sliding door is not closed unless you close it with full power  and you hear a THUNDER noise  and the whole van shudders  So every time you have to try about 3 4 times to close it  I also hate the design of the Aerostar  Also had a lot of problems w  the Air conditioning  The stereo system sounds very bad I also dislike that you have to climb in into the van  Like a big SUV  The new minivans today  excluding Chevy Astro  has a low step in height  which is great On the other hand  it has a very strong engine  It s a truck like van  with the powerful and noisy engine  And   it s better than nothing  It s my first vehicle  so I m happy with it  until I ll have money for a better one  I need a minivan for the room of it  I ve once rented a Ford Windstar 2000  and another time the Pontiac Montana 2001  and they re unbelievable  Very smooth  good braking  comfortable seating  and nice panels  with a lot of features  So when I got back to my Aerostar I wasn t happy  No features  no nothing  Just a simple  HEAVY DUTY  minivan Sorry for my English
