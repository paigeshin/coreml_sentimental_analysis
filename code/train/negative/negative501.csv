 I loved this car until everything started going wrong with it  It has been in the shop numerous times just for recalls  how safe can that be  Then it has been in the shop for repairs and they can never seem to find the problem Now for the good things  The interior is very roomy and comfortable  Ours is loaded with power everything which is great  Power windows are the best when you are alone in the car and need that passenger window down  same with power door locks  The car gets decent gas mileage on the highway but really sucks it down in the daily driving around town  All in all we are pleased with it but are ready to pay it off and start with something else br br
