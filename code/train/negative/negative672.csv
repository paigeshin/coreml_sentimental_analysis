 I thought the Ford Focus sedan was the ugliest car I had ever seen the first time I laid eyes on it  I was never so happy as when my best friend got rid of this rental car  Of course at this time I had not yet seen the hatchbacks  and as of now I have not had the misfortune to be in one either  Now in this car s defense  it does handle well on sharp turns and I was in a base model  so this review is about the base model only  In further defense  the car is relatively quiet while driving it  I can think of absolutely nothing else positive to say about this car Aside from it s ugliness  with a huge back end and odd shape   unless you get the hatchback which simply looks like a rectangle on wheels  the tiny  high back window reduces visibility to the sides making lane changes difficult  The car does come equipped with all required safety features   I can understand why The car is also designed backwards  It really is  The window rolls down in the wrong direction  the controls are different from other cars  the locks are very difficult to use  there is no center console  the dashboard is slanted downward so nothing will stay on it  and the glove compartment is under the dashboard so the passenger has to move the seat back to access it  I don t think the car could have been designed to be more inconvenient if it were done on purpose My last gripe about this car is the fact that it gives off a huge amount of static electricity  This is a problem that I don t have very often with other cars  and if I do it is a small shock here and there  With the Focus  my friends and I got a very painful  loud electric shock every time we exited the car  All of my friends had the same problem  and there was never a time it did not happen  Now I m not a physicist  and I don t know what is going on to cause this  but I know I can t live with being zapped every time I get out of my car  and for this and all the other reasons above I would never recommend the Focus br br
