 The Ford Ranger pickup with the extended cab is a great size  it is nice looking  and its probably a lot of fun to drive  not that I would really know  Here s my experience with one just last week Budget has a special on the Ford Ranger truck where you can rent one  with a locking bed cover  for  20 a day  So I booked one  Twice  The first time they didn t have any  so they gave me a Taurus  see my review at  a href auto review 778A 17C334B 390A32D3 prod5 http www epinions com auto review 778A 17C334B 390A32D3 prod5 a    The second time they had several Rangers on the lot  and I got a beautiful new white 4WD model  I was really looking forward to enjoying this truck for a week  Until       I couldn t put my two childrens  child safety seats in the truck b  The Ranger has two fold down  diagonally oriented jump seats in the extended cab  They are equipped with an auto retracting lap belt  Child seats were completely unusable in this truck  except in the front bench seat  provided I could detach my right arm to make room for the middle mounted seat  This was a surprise to me since I own a Toyota Xtra Cab pickup that is similar in size to the Ranger  and in it the properly forward facing jump seats very safely accommodate both child seats in the back The truck started easily  ran well  and was quite comfortable during my ride from the parking space at the rental car pick up area to the loading area where I couldn t put the kids  seats in  and back to the parking space  a total of about 100 meters  I had to trade the Ranger in for a Hyundai  Now I m no fan of Ford  but Hyundais are just embarrassing  I did get the seats in that though So I have to give the Ranger a poor rating due to its family un friendliness  Its a shame that I never had the chance to take it out on the open road  drive with gusto  and have it break down on me  like just about all Fords I ve ever driven have   Did you read the Taurus review  But to its credit  it seems like such a cool truck otherwise  that if I happen to be renting again at a time when I don t need to use child seats in it  I ll give the Ford Ranger another shot br br
