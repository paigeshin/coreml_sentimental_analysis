 I am not intimately familiar with the Ford 350 Series  beyond reading the corporate blurb graciously provided by Ford  However  having observed  quot up close and personal quot  some of the driving done by 350 owners  as well as some proud 250 and 150 owners as well  I feel qualified to comment on one aspect of the vehicle That aspect would be the snappy  space age appearance of the front end  Pickups  and Fords in particular  used to take a perverse pride in being utilitarian and ugly  but those days are over  I can say this with complete certainty  as I have been privileged to have been able to catch many a close up view of the lights  grill design  general aero look  and ubiquitous Ford emblem in my rear view mirror  usually while traveling at or slightly above the speed limit in the righthand lane  Apparently  this vehicle imbues its operator with the notion that it is made to be driven in the manner of a semi  like  real close to your rear bumper  in the mistaken belief that such roadway bullying will cause me to speed up  pull over  or spontaneously combust  At night  this unseemly intimacy is generally accompanied by the use of high beams as well   I am working on a device that will refocus incoming light back onto the offending vehicle s radiator and boil it dry  My usual reaction to such foolishness is to ease off the gas a tad until we re both going about 10 mph slower  so as to get an even better view of that fabulous front end  and perhaps even sneak a peek at the smoke coming out of Zippy The Pinhead s ears  I m not ready to switch vehicles just yet  but it is a comfort to know that when the day arrives  I need but to tap the brakes to facilitate some timely financing for my next vehicle Anyway  congratulations  Ford  for designing a front end that fills my mirror  and other too  I m sure  with a view of serious design thinking and implementation  I m not trying to leave Chevy and Dodge pickup drivers out of this   they can certainly be irritating in their own way  but not with the panache of the Ford  It may be Found On the Road Dead  but ya gotta love the way it looks when it does br br
