 My husband purchased a 1992 Ford Probe used in 1997  It already had 100 000 miles on it  Unfortunately  my husband was blinded by the sporty car that he could actually afford  He was just starting his career at that time  There were problems from the start of his even considering this car On the lot  there was a newer model Ford Probe with less miles  Obviously it cost more  Well  my husband really liked this car  The salesman got him really interested in that car and offered for him to drive it off the lot on Saturday night and come back Monday to work out specifics  Thankfully  my husband did not take up that offer  I should also mention my husband was in a hurry to get a car because his car had been stolen When he returned to the dealership the following Monday  the same salesman told him that he couldn t afford the newer Probe and had no memory of even offering it  Since my husband had gotten his heart set on this car  he settled for the older Probe  He got a pretty decent loan from Ford Credit Company and was paying about  200 month  He paid the blue book value for the car  Within 2 months  things were going wrong  Within 5 months  it became obvious that the previous owner had  quot worked quot  on the car  creating several problems  Besides the regular payment  the Probe was costing about  1000 in repairs every 3 months  That s a lot of money  Even though the car was sold qualifying under the lemon law  by the time there was enough problems to take action  the dealership was under new management and they supposedly could not do anything  Ford was contacted  but by the time they responded  the dealership had dissolved The final straw came when the drivers side window broke  It wouldn t roll up all the way  The estimated cost to repair it was over  500  Immediately  we started looking for another car  We pawned it off on an unsuspecting Saturn dealership in Tucson  who over valued the car  They told us they would auction it off for parts  so we didn t feel so bad  We were never happier to get rid of a car  We cannot recommend a Ford Probe to anybody  especially because the Probe model has been discontinued and you can only purchase it used at this time  Our treatment from Ford was also very poor  We won t be buying any Ford cars in the future  Please see my response to the  quot excuses quot  of why the problems of this car should have been expected in the comments section br br
