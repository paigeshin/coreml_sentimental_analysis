 I had a rental Taurus a few weeks ago  I had reserved a Ranger Pickup  but the company didn t have any in  so they gave me a new Taurus  I thought I was getting a deal  but I sure was wrong  Ironically  the rental agent said to me   quot I m giving you a new Taurus  since you have the two babies  I wouldn t want a car to break down on you quot  An omen The car was fine for the first few days  save the awkward placement of the controls and the layout of the interior in general that one comes to expect with most American nameplate autos It wasn t until a rainy afternoon when the car left my wife sit at some train station outside Boston  Wouldn t start  wouldn t turn over  totally dead  The tow truck driver  whom I got to spend about three and a half hours of quality time with as we made our way to the rental car facility at Logan airport  suspected the car failed because it was  quot wet quot I ve never liked Fords  and I used to own one that was an absolute piece of junk  Needless to say  this Taurus hasn t changed my opinion So for your own sake  don t buy this car  Test drive a nice Honda  Nissan  VW  or Toyota  Sure they cost more  but you can drive them when its raining br br
