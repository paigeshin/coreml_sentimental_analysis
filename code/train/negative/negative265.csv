 My wife and I lease a 1997 FORD RANGER XLT  She absolutely LOVES it  but I wish I could drive it off a cliff When we purchased the truck in February 1997  it was a very sturdy truck  with power and comfort all together  However  after only 50 000 miles  it feels like it s falling apart at the seams  In Ohio  the highways and biways are constantly cracking and getting potholes in them  The bumps on the roadways are enough to make an airsick person want to fly to get around  What has happened over the past few years with this truck  is that the suspension is not shot  the steering is over sensitive  it seems lighter around corners  and all in all it makes me very uncomfortable driving it around Any vehicle that fish tails when it hits a little bump in the road while going around a gentle curve IS NOT SAFE  My wife gets studs put on the rear tires for winter driving  but we have to put 8 10 bags of sand in the bed of the truck for the studs to make any difference whatsoever  We did not get an extended cab  so needless to say  the seats aren t as comfortable as possible  However  FORD puts the seats so high up in the cab  that the roof seems too short  I am only 5 9  and I feel like I have to slouch to keep from hitting the ceiling The blind side is HUGE  This is because the rear window does not extend far enough to the side of the truck  to increase the peripheral vision The electrical system shorted out after only 1 year of driving it  For instance  if I want to turn the wipers on  I turn the knob  but have to wait for about 3 4 minutes for them to kick in  Then  after I turn them off  I ll be driving down the road a little way  and the HIGH SPEED wipers will just start going  AND I CAN T STOP THEM  I wasn t going to mention the fact that the WASHER FLUID dispensers don t work either  You may ask  Why didn t you take it to the shop to get it fixed  My answer  I did twice  They work for a couple weeks  or even a month  Then  it starts happening again Well  my wife loves it  That s why we still have it in the driveway  Next February  when the lease has expired  it s Bye Bye Ranger
