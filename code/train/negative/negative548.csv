 I have owned a ford explorer sport for about two years  I love the ride and the extras but the engine leaves something to be desired I had this vehicle for about three months and the engine siezed up and had to be completely replaced what a disaster A friend of mine had the same excate SUV and the SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM  Ford sent him a letter and told him they were aware of the problems but as if yet there as never been a recall or an offer to exchange the engine before it leaves you stranded on some lonely road I still have this SUV but refuse to drive it on trips because of the questionable reliability br br
