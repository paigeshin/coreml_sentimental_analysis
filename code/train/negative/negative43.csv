 I have owned my 1994 Ford Tempo now since July of 1995 and though Ford is usually a  quot name you can trust quot  it is not in this case  This car has had constant problems with the brakes  which no one can seem to fix  with the engine itself  an oil leak that I swear was there when it left the factory floor  bad locks  bad door handles I could go on and on and on I thought that this would be a reliable family type car  big enough for groceries  yet not so big that it would be hard to handle  Instead I find that this car is so unreliable and shoddily made as far as I am concerned  it should never have been built in the first place  Due to financial trouble  I got roped into paying  52 37 a week FOR FIVE YEARS For this lemon knowing what I know now  I wouldnt give Ford the first MONTH s worth of payments for this money pit br br
