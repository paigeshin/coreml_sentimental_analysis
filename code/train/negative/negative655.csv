 I admit that I m not much of a mechanic so this will not be detailed or technical  I ll just get to the basics  Six years ago  my parents bought a 1996 Ford Windstar  and today  it s a constant pain  We ve had problems with all sorts of noises  there have been times when we had noises whenever the car turned and noises when you apply the brakes  Also  the brake warning light is constantly coming on leading to road trips in which we worry if we ll make it home safely  We usually don t use it for long trips unless we have a lot of stuff to carry  We ve also had transmission problems  The brakes have even stopped working once  However  when we take the van to the Ford place to get it fixed  the mechanics claim that they don t hear the noises  When they do  fix  it  we end up with a different noise the next month  Once  we even had to take it back the week after taking it to the shop  Further taking the car to the shop is a day long event  or longer  and a major incovenience It turns out that the Ford Windstar was recalled because of brake problems but not the 1996 although it appears that there was reason to  Apparently we were among the truly blessed since others have had accidents caused by head gasket problems  The epinions site wouldn t let me put the link here for you  it read it as a word that was too long  but look it up at consumeraffairs com All in all it seems sorry compared to our Toyota Camry which we rarely have to take to the shop and when we do  the service is much better  Over the years we have spent thousands on fixing this car  My mom s credit card bill has risen because of repairs on this minivan  Perhaps you would be blessed to find one of the good ones but I wouldn t risk it
