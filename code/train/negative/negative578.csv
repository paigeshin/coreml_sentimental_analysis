 I rented one from Hertz while on a business trip since they were out of the reserved type and was looking forward to driving it since I had heard people rave about it I was quite disappointed actually  the engine was loud  this could be a plus for some it had a rough idle and was generally unrefined though powerful it did seem to smooth out over 60 mph somewhat  the interior layout  amp  dash were ugly and badly designed it actually looked cheap   i strongly felt i could have designed a better dash   my tercel had a nicer  cleaner  smoother layout  the power seat controls were difficult to reach  i m 6 1 quot and i had to actually get out of the car to properly adjust my seat This is not the kind of car i would like to own ever I guess I was  spoiled  after riding the Saab 9 5 which is a lot more expensive  you get what you pay for i suppose I find it hard to believe that a nicer sporty car cannot be built at this price range Take one for a test drive and see for yourself br br
