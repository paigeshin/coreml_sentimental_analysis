 I feel I have a thorough opinion of this truck compared to most who post evaluations of their vehicles  My truck has been owned by me since new and currently have 75k miles  I ve been meticulous with maintenance and treating my truck with normal duty activities  never exceeding the manufacturer s recommendations This is information regarding my vehicle and the excessive amount of problems found during an inspection 15 Sept 2003  It s reference for anyone else who has had the same problems or looking for information regarding warranties and extended warranties  You are welcome to give some feedback  VEHICLE  2000 FORD F150 5 4L 4x4 XLT w  Off Road   Tow Package 17  Rims  Everything factory install  all the top options included  EXTENDED WARRANTY  Purchased FORD s version 75K mile Bumper to Bumper coverage when new  50 deductible per drive in occurrence  DRIVING CONDITIONS  Never taken off road  Never towed anything of significant weight and Never used inappropriately Toward the last 400 miles of my 75K mile Ford purchased extended warranty bumper to bumper plan  the passenger side power door lock failed and the ABS light turned on  I brought it in to the dealer for an inspection along with some squeeking of the front end  thought it was a tire rim leak  PROBLEMS FOUND 1  All 4 tie rods  inners and outers  bad 2  Lower ball joints  bad 3  ABS Codes C1095 and C1096  ECU and HCU Controller and Module Assembly  bad 4  Passenger side door lock actuator  bad 5  Power Steering Pump  bad  air conditioning warranty replaced back at 30k miles  All items above were replaced under the purchased extended warranty bumber to bumber plan  EXCEPT a kit for the module assembly on the ABS  I will dispute that today  but had to pay for it to get it done  I am shocked that this much damage was found for a vehicle at only 75k miles proclaimed to be  Built Ford Tough  yet only offering a 36K mile manufacturer warranty  If I did not have the extended warranty  I could only guess the bill to pay for this The extended cab seating is extremely cramped  My friends refuse to be a passenger in the back  The rear bench seating is hard  very uncomfortable  General Motors seems to have very comfortable and roomy seating in their comparable models  The ignition is hidden and difficult to find  The stereo is second class for sound and tuning stations  especially AM  Factory installed tires have no significant grip traction after 10 000 miles  I recommend getting a spray in liner to help prevent the large dents and scratches that have happened in my truck  but not trucks that have been sprayed  The metal can t hold up and appears thin for the bed I do like the exterior look of the F150  The height is fantastic  I can see all around while driving  it certainly upsets small vehicle drivers behind me  tailgating me and assuming I m a slow road hog in the left lane  but when trying to pass  they see the road jammed full of cars in front of me  bumper to bumper  Accelerations and towing torque are very good  Although now I sense a loss or hesitation on a occasions when I have to suddenly put the petal to the medal to avoid accidents Expect to pay the value of your truck in maintenance costs from the dealer  They make their money on repairs and maintenance  very expensive  I m not complaining about this  but you buy and expensive truck  expect to pay for the maintenance
