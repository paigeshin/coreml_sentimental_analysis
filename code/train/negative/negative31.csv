 I bought this as a car to fix up and play with  It is a 1974 four door  I love the power the 26 year old motor 400M   2V  has  Tire smoke out of your Grandmas grocery getter  I hate the damn AM radio but that will be fixed shortly with a cd player two subs and 8 midbass and treble speakers  stereo is another hobby  I hate that it is so looooooooooong  It rides real smooth even though it is 26 years old  It only has 94 000 miles though  If you are looking for a car to play with or are looking for a drivetrain combination  this full size is the way to go  It looks good with a 2 inch drop  flowmasters  Cragar S S s and fat firehawks  especially with Bright yellow paint with a black top and black pinstripes br br
