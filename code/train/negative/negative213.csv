 I bought a 1994 Ford Mustang because of the looks and when I test drove it I enjoyed the ride  I had always wanted a Mustang since before I got my license and I had just that for my first car  The car looks very sporty and has plenty of curves  It comes with either a V6 or V8 engine and hard top or convertible  The seats were very comfortable with the exception of there not being much room in the car  If you want a roomy backseat though  this car isn t for you  It can feel a little bit cramped though  The controls on the car are easy to reach and not difficult to figure out  And being short  the power seats were very much appreciated  It comes with basically power everything  seats  windows  door locks  It also comes with tilt steering and airbags  and four disk brakes  ABS at that time was an option for the car I believe which I didn t have  It even has one cup holder which is convenient to reach exciting isn t it  I recommend the Mustang having a spoiler because without one it doesn t look right to me  I bought the car without a spoiler and ended up buying one down the road  I loved how the car handled corners and the acceleration was decent for a V6  With good tires and a dry road  it holds the road very well and hugs corners nicely  I thought the interior was very well done and it was a big improvement from past year Mustangs which looked cheap and lacked taste  I prefer the more recent Ford interiors over most other car manufacturers because they seem more appealing and are better made  The car was horrible in the winter  well  if you consider going up a hill sideways in the snow bad  Of course  any sports car in the winter is a challenge to drive  When you drive this car you can feel every bump in the road and it gets to be uncomfortable after a while  Things tend to shake and rattle in the car at times  because of bumpy roads  but for the most part this car is best suited for an even  well paved road because then the road is smooth and relatively quiet  The gas mileage for the highway is very good  It gets about 27 miles to the gallon on the highway  Local driving it gets about 17 to 20 depending on the stop and go of driving  With the gas tank only being 15 4 gallons going to the gas station at times happens frequently but when you drive all over the place it is expected  The one thing against Ford and their sports cars compared to Chevy is that the older Mustangs are a little bit underpowered considering what the Camaro has even though with the newer model Mustangs they increased the horsepower  To my best knowledge  the 1994 3 8 L V6 Mustang has about 145 horsepower with 230 pounds of torque which to me isn t bad but compared to about 50 more horsepower with the Camaro Chevy puts Ford to shame   if you want to see a comparison of the two I believe Vara has a review on these two cars I do not reccomend this car to anyone who doesn t have the money for repairs or who doesn t want to sink a lot into the car  Why you ask I ll tell you  First of all  my transmission went at 40 000 miles and that was about twelve hundred to fix  I had another friend who had a 1994 Mustang GT and her transmission went at about 34 000 miles  Ford wouldnt even honor any part of the warranty and my family had been buying cars from that dealer for years  Secondly  I had to spend another four hundred dollars to get the frame fixed in the back because somehow it had cracked and i have never been in an accident  The car sucks up gas like theres no tomorrow in the winter  it handles poorly in any type of bad weather condition and it seemed like any time i turned around something was going wrong with the car or something was breaking  Then again  maybe I just had a poorly manufactured Mustang  My car has a very loud and obnoxious engine knock that wont go away except when I put high octane gas it in  When that is done  the engine purrs like a kitten and I love the way the engine sounds when I hit the accelerator hard  I have had a few problems keeping the wheels aligned and it has wore down a lot of my tires but considering I tend to drive it hard at times I most likely am to blame the most for wear and tear and the tires  If you have the money it can be worth getting but unless Ford made better quality cars  it d be sufficient to say you might be throwing money down the toilet for this car  If you want looks  the Mustang is nice  but if you want reliability stay far away from this car  In my opinion  and I m not a mechanic so I can t say for sure  pounding this car while accelerating does more damage to the transmission than anything else  From what I have heard Ford s transmissions are very weak and that is why the Cobra Mustang only has a manual transmission because the automatic isn t strong enough  And to top that off I have been told Ford makes a cr ppy transmission for the six cylinder cars anyway and its one of their worst transmissions  Again  I don t know how true this actually is so I am not saying for sure I am right  Either way  I do not recommend abusing the transmission and that goes for any car  For the most part  take it easy with the car  Don t floor it from a dead stop unless necessary  Once in a while is okay I m assuming but not constant  Again  this car is a pleasure to drive on a nice day cruising the roads and even though I partially hate this car because of all the trouble it has had  its 80 000 miles strong and each time I have to go somewhere I still look forward to getting behind the wheel  At one point I loved this car so much I gave it a pet name  My car s name is Billy  Everyone say hi to my baby  Billy  And when Billy goes one day it will be missed I ll almost feel like I ve lost a child   I m not crazy really  just a little too attached
