 My parents bought the 1990 Taurus L brand new in August 1990  I thought it was only the second car they ever bought that wasn t dorky looking  the other being a 1981 Monte Carlo  It was white with a black interior  which proved to be very hot in the summer time  They gave me the car as a college graduation present in May 1996 with 42 000 miles on it  I drove it to 148 000 miles somehow  I ll start by saying what I liked  Styling  The taurus was a great looking car  about the right size to carry 4 5 people  comfortable seats  very legible gauges  good acceleration with the 3 0 V6  great handling  good cargo room in the trunk  I also liked the air conditioner which was much stronger than other Fords I ve driven when it worked  I liked the fake wood strip on the dashboard it looked like wood not plastic  The stereo speakers sounded good until I put a 50 watt per channel JVC in there and it blew them up in a few days  I also liked the big mirrors on the Taurus  Now for the bad  And there was a lot of bad  The car went through two transmissions  each costing  1800  The ignition module failed 4 or 5 times  The fuel injection had to be replaced at 69 000 miles  I went through so many power steering pumps I forgot to keep track  i m guessing five or more  The five Alternators lasted maybe 30 000 miles  water pumps lasted 40 000  went through 4 of those too  I got really darned good at replacing things under the hood  THe factory radiator was plastic and it cracked through at 70 000 miles  The transmission s  always shifted hard and abrupt with a lot of gear whine  The CV boots were always disentigrating  The Ford brake pads were good for maybe 25 000 miles a set  front rotors lasted twice that  rear drums went only 70 000 miles and this was with nothing but highway driving  The seats were threadbare before 100 000 miles  The windows  doors  and windshields leaked so badly that I eventually had to rip out the carpeting and padding and throw it all away due to mold  That revealed serious disfiguring rust in the unibody and floorboards  The trunk had a basketball sized hole in it from rust  The windshield would drip on my feet it rusted the brake pedal  Electrical problem that was never solved began around 90k entire electrical system would go dead except the battery  which was fully charged  It would sit for days and then BAM  It would decide to start    The ignition switch wore out every 40 000 miles  Eventually the locking mechanism kept jamming so I took a crowbar and just broke the darned thing and started the car by just pulling up on the little rod inside the steering column  Everyone thought it was a stolen car because of that no  just poor Ford quality   The turn signal stalk broke off and the one I got at the junkyard broke off too  The cruise control worked sometimes  The PRNDL gear indicator was way off so it looked like it was in reverse when it was really in drive  The headliner fell out  the door panels fell off  the struts on the hood gave out so I had to prop it open with a 2x4 to work on it  The suspension was forever out of alignment The dealer service WHAT dealer service  The Ford dealers in Louisville  KY are these giant conglomerate corporations that care about money not customer service  I learned to just go buy the parts and do the work myself as they either didn t have mechanics who were competent or they just rolled their eyes when yet  another  problem Taurus came in for repairs  By the time I scraped together the cash to buy a new vehicle  the engine was just about shot and the cylinder compression was gone in two cylinders  plus the oil pump was gone and the valvetrain was tapping badly  sounded like an old Chrysler Slant Six if ya know what I mean   The Taurus left me stranded so many times I almost got fired from my job for being late or no show so much  The boss just couldn t believe there was a car this unreliable but it was true   So finally in April 1998 I bought a new GMC Sonoma  That s a total POS too read my review on that lemon here on Epinions  I got  1000 for the Taurus on a trade in  and still owed  3800 on it for repairs  It took me 2 years to pay off on a car I didn t even own anymore  NO MORE American made junk for me  My next car will come from Germany or Japan  end of comment
