 I test drove and was about to buy this vehicle  It is large and roomy  but somehow even on the luxury model it doesn t feel luxury  It has a very basic feel to it  After test driving this vehicle I looked this vehicle up in the Consumers Report  This car rated fairly well  but not great and for the price it should be great  The Toyota 4 Runner is about the same price and is of amazing quality and reliability  A friend of mine is a Account Executive for a large pharmaceutical corporation that purchased a fleet of Explorers for their account exec s  she also had just owned a 4 runner  and she said that her car has not been that great and is not that reliable  She insisted that I not purchase the Ford Explorer  First hand experience is a very reliable resource for information I am not telling you to not purchase this vehicle  I am saying  quot Do the research quot  It looks pretty  but if the maintenance and depreciation stinks  you re not getting that great of a deal  If you can buy another quality SUV  even if it s a little bit more  but it s not in the shop all the time and it has good value when you go to sell it  you have made out Shop wisely and good luck  P S  A little tip to save you money  Unless you off road more than once or twice a year  buy the 2 x 4 and not the 4 x 4  The 4 x 4 costs several thousands more and raises your insurance rates  Most people make the mistake of thinking that they have to have 4 x 4  You don t  You have truck handling and height for rough riding  a 4 x 4 is only really needed for off roading  soft sands  etc br br
