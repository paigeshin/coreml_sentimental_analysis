 If my truck had been a boat  I doubt I would have made it out of the port  I have had so many problems with my  1995 Ford Ranger XLT Supercab  since purchasing it brand new that it s a wonder it hasn t just spontaneously combusted  but with my luck I probably would have been sitting in it if that would have happened  The funny thing is someone even tried to steal my truck back in 1996 but they gave up pretty quick for some reason  I suspect I now know why b i NOTE  Prices in Canadian Dollars   b The Good Stuff About My Truck  It s a great looking truck  When you sit and just look at it  it really looks good  Too bad it doesn t do a whole lot of good for me to just sit and look at it The seats are fantastic  60 40 split bench  If there is one thing that has stood the test of time with my truck  it s the drivers seat  It is very comfortable for those long drives  my parents live 6 hours away from Calgary  and the upholstery is quite durable  Have never had any stain problems and everything is very easy to clean I tend to take a lot of stuff when I travel  The good thing about the Ranger with the extended cab is there is a lot of space  I even squeezed seven people into my truck once  not against their will Power is always a plus with any truck  and mine is not too shabby in that department  With a V6  4L engine and 170 HP it has quite a bit of kick for a small truck  Definitely a good thing The fuel efficiency on my truck is also not too bad  especially for a truck  I don t know exactly what it is but I can generally make it around 500 KMS  310 Miles  on   of a tank of gas b The Forgotten Realms Series of Fantasy Books About  The Time of Troubles  Surprisingly Are NOT About My Truck  Although They Could Easily Have Been  The most defective part of my truck all these years has been the breaks  I can t get through a year without having break problems such as pulling to one side or trembling when I push on the brakes  I ve had my breaks replaced two times over the course of about 130 000 KMS  80 000 Miles  and the problems always seem to return  I do drive in the city a lot  but I know plenty of people with a wide variety of vehicles and models that have never had the break problems I have had  I d like to think brakes are supposed to last a little longer than 45 000 KMS  28 000 Miles  and not have to be constantly serviced  Total brake repair costs to date   2000 The most expensive one time problem I have had with my truck was a couple of years ago  at around 75 000 KMS  46 000 Miles  My truck wouldn t start a couple of times and I was informed by my mechanic I had to have my head gaskets rebuilt at a cost of over  1000  Apparently there was oil leaking from them which was causing overheating and setting off a sensor that was not allowing the engine to start  None of the other Ford vehicles in my family have ever had head gasket problems  we all have around the same number of KMS Miles on our vehicles Ford actually issued a recall of head gaskets a year or two ago on a wide range of vehicles which included some 1995 models  but sadly the recall did not include Rangers  On the bright side  since the repairs have been done I have had no further engine problems  knock on wood Shortly after my 60 000 KM  37 000 Miles  warranty ran out on my truck I encountered a couple of annoying problems  my headlights wouldn t turn on and my door ajar sensor would stick for up to a half hour   Oh the sweet sounds of DING  DING  DING  DING For some reason one day when I went to switch my headlights to high beam the system shorted out and all I had left was the daylight driving lights  Cost to repair    300  And then there is the door ajar sensor  I ve had to replace it twice because it kept sticking on no matter what I tried to fix it  Cost to repair   Around  200 each time  My brother s Ranger has also had this problem  although he only had to replace his sensor once In addition to these problems  I have had plenty of minor problems such as the engine mis firing at higher speeds  above 100 KPH   62 MPH  but most were covered by the original warranty or a recent repair warranty  This still doesn t take away from the fact I cannot seem to go more than a month or two without encountering some new or repeat problem with the truck b Overall Opinion Summary  Although I m not ever planning on getting a Ford Ranger ever  ever  ever again  I m still a Ford fan  My family owns 4 Ford vehicles and mine has been the only true dud of the batch  I really do believe I just bought the truly  horribly bad truck of the batch   so I am rating my truck 1 out of 5 overall b The Non Fun I ve Had With My Truck  Not related to vehicle defects  at least directly b Although some of the problems I ve had with my truck I m about to detail are crappy  they are generally  NOT  related to the quality of the truck or the defects I have had to deal with  I just want to illustrate the point that I honestly think my truck is cursed  Anyone know a good exorcist It all started with an attempted break in while my friend and I were at a hockey game  The thief had attempted to knock out the passenger side door lock with a screw driver or something but had failed  I suspect the truck probably growled at the would be thief or something and scared him off  I swiftly responded to the attempted break in with the installation of a car alarm After shopping around for a decent price  I settled on A B Sound in NE Calgary for my alarm choice  I left my truck for the day and the alarm was installed  End of story  Nope  I had to return 3 more times because the alarm did not  agree  with my truck and would false constantly  So we upgraded the alarm to try and solve the problem  End of Story  Nope  Had to return 2 more times because the alarm still didn t agree with my truck  Finally they figured they had the problem beat and even decided to compensate me by installing a remote car starter along with the final repairs for cost and no installation charge at  60  I took the deal and have never had any alarm or starter problems since thank goodness But the problems didn t end there for me  of course  The next incident I had with the truck was a near severe accident  I was driving back to Calgary from visiting my parents in my home town  and while driving down the highway I watched in horror as a fully loaded dump truck ran a stop sign heading right in my path  I actually yanked the steering wheel and skidded down the highway at a 90 degree angle avoiding an accident  I got off the highway and the guy walked over to me and profusely apologized for 5 minutes while I tried to calm down  It was brutal to say the least I m not going to go into details about the next two fun events but they go like this  1  hit by a guy that ran a red light   8000 damage covered by insurance  2  my friend and I  largely because of our silliness  got stuck under an apartment garage door while moving stuff out of his old apartment causing damage to my windshield wipers and hood   Cost  600 The last one I m going to mention is the doozy of the whole stack  I had brake problems  as usual  back in 1999 and took them to a local mechanic to be serviced  Upon leaving I noticed my breaks were making a ton of noise so I went back only to find out they had screwed the job up  So a few hours later everything was supposed to be completely fixed  So I headed home  I was supposed to head across the city  via our major freeway  to pick up a friend after the repairs were done but he canceled at the last minute so I just headed home  thankfully Upon returning home I decided to head to the nearby grocery store to grab some stuff  and when I was a few blocks away from my house  my breaks completely failed  I had none  I quickly kicked the truck into 2nd and 1st gears to slow down and coasted home  luckily there was very little traffic around at the time  What I found out when I had the truck towed to Ford  where I had NOT had the repairs done at  was that someone had put oil in my master cylinder  this thing regulates the break fluid for your vehicle  I actually still have the one with the oil in it in my possession  I had service done at both Ford and a local mechanic within a two week time period so there was no way to squarely place the blame on either one  or so I was told At this point  or probably some point long before this point  you probably asked yourself  why didn t this guy get rid of this truck a long time ago  Well that s a darn good question  Every time there was a problem  I basically hoped and prayed it was the last  And it just seemed like I had invested so much into the truck that it would be an even bigger waste to get rid of it now  Perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel is over the past year I have had the least number of problems since I ve owned the freaking thing  A friend of mine speculated that if we poured holy water on my truck  it would probably growl at us and catch on fire or something  Don t suppose anyone else out there also has a cursed Ranger b Amount Paid  In Canadian b   22 000
