 I bought my 94 Taurus used in 97  it had 80 000 miles on it  After 1 year  the transmission refused to enter into any gear  This required 2200 dollars worth of transmission rebuild work  Four months later the transmission decides it wants to pick and choose when it will go into Drive  Turns out that a valve sticks  A little tranny lube solved this problem  Five months ago the surpentine belt tension froze  destroying the pulleys on the water pump and power steering pump  Another  400 dollars  One month ago  the headlight switch wiring harness completely melted  leaving me stuck at night with no lights what so ever  I recently ran across a recall list for this model year of taurus and was astonished  There are no less than seven recalls for it On the bright side  the engine has run completely trouble free  And the car is very comfortable on long trips  and with 124 000 miles on it  still has plenty of power Readers  please research your next used car purchase very carefully Brian
