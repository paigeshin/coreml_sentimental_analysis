 My daughter recently took over control of the Family 99 Explorer  Plus I just dumped our van  With this  I decided that maybe my 3 seat explorer wasn t quite as big as I once thought  So  I am shopping for a Full size SUV  I hate mini vans  Besides  I need 5 cars like a hole in the head First Impression God this thing is huge  It looks a lot bigger than a Tahoe  but in reality  its about the same size  I liked the choice of exterior color  although a rust color would look great  I did not like the major use of plastic  It gave it a cheap look Drive train The 4wd unit I drove had the 5 4 V 8  Plenty of power  The gas gauge was at a quarter of a tank when I started the test drive and was dead on E when I returned  I only drove 25 miles I did not like its handling very much either  It leaned a lot and seemed bothered by large cross winds  Plus this one had an annoying rattle in the roof  Also  it rode like a buck board  My bum was very stiff  Interior I liked the seats and I like how the dashboard was laid out  But that is about all I liked  It was just plastic and some faux leather stuff  Plus I thought the DVD system took up to much room  I did not stay in more than thirty minuets  and that is about all I could stand  Durability If the rattle was any indication  it probably won t last very long
