 I own a 1993 Ford Tempo  Ever since I bought it I have had to do nothing but put money into it  The car was great for the first year or so and after that I ve been spending about  1000 a year in repairs  The tie rod design is very poor and they need to be replaced about every 30 000 miles  I had to put three alternators in it already  and the front end has given me lots of problems  This has been a very costly vehicle to own and I will never buy a Ford again  I ve had nothing but problems with mine and haven t heard anything good from anyone else about Fords  Unfortunately I can t afford to buy another car for a few years so I am stuck with this lemon for awhile if I don t go broke first
