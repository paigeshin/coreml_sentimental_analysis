 OH  I Just Love my Bright Red  Super Cab Ranger with The AWESOME Sports Package  But I m finding that Ford s Famous Saying  quot Quality Is Job One quot  is far from the truth  I own an 1988 Ford Ranger with almost 200 000 miles on it that s much Superior to my 1999 Ranger  I m finding that there s many flaws in the paint  There are several spots where there was dirt under the paint and now the paint has come off  The Optional Bigger engine with more horsepower as compared to the Imports standard engine is way below standards  The cheap look and Quality of the inside door panels and Door Pulls are very Disgusting  A Few weeks after I bought this Truck  the Door Pull and panel behind it started to peel  I had this replaced and guess what  The Second one is doing the same thing  Yes  I Do Love the Outside Looks of My Truck  But I seriously Doubt that I ll ever buy another Ford  That s one reason why I just purchased a Subaru Car instead of a Ford Focus  And I have bought Ford s all my Life  May I Ask Ford  why the price keeps going up and the Quality Keeps Going Down  Better Be Careful Ford  Because the Love of Money may just end up hurting you in the Long Run  It Just Cost You An  18 500 Sale with me br br
