 Fortunately I did not pay for this minivan  I took delivery of it in April 1999 as my company vehicle  I ve driven company vehicles since 1973 and have looked after them as if they were my own  I have always purchased them afterwards but this Windstar will probably be the first exception in 28 years When I drove it home from the dealer and parked in my driveway  the hood looked like had condensation on it  Unfortunately this was such a poor paint job it looked like someone had used an aerosol paint can to do it  I immediately took it back to the dealer where I was met with complete indifference and was told to  take it round the back to the collision centre  They wouldn t replace the hood and would only repaint it  Three days later I arrived home with the new Windstar  a paint job and 12 miles on the odometer Once the weather warmed up the engine began to ping premature detonation of fuel mixture  at 1800 RPM  I heard all sorts of reasons from  it s your ashtray  to  you must have had the van gassed up while playing the radio  this corrupts its processor  I had it in 7 times for this pinging until in September 2000 the engine rattled so bad that it clunked to a standstill  totally seized at 25 000 miles  It took over a week to have a replacement recycled  engine installed and the Ford dealer would NOT provide a loaner Once the weather warmed up in 2001 the pinging started again with the second engine  This time I went to another Ford dealer in the next town  This dealer was excellent and within two visits have almost eliminated the ping by recalibrating the processor and installing a new style valve cover which has an additional baffle to prevent oil vapors from being burnt Other poor points Radio cuts out when a passenger gets into van  This is annoying when listening the news in a parking lot Radio sometimes stays on when driver removes key and leaves van  When this happens  the power windows are still  live  this appears to have drained the battery several times  Now I always check before exiting The horn is difficult to use  You must first find the seam on the large airbag cover as it s the only part that will sound the horn quite dangerous Windshield appears to have a badly shaped area right in front of the driver which won t clean properly in icy weather Seats are rather thin and small  I was in Europe recently and my small econobox car over there had proper seats that actually were wide and comfortable  The Windstar has lots of wasted space either side of the seats The roof on Windstars has a strange seam on either side which appears to be filled with a hard putty  The paint soon cracks on this material Rear speakers are intermittent because of poorly designed spring loaded contacts on sliding doors  I often clean them to get the rear speakers to work In damp weather the plastic panels squeak Rear licence plate shield   light holders broke off Huge turning circle makes these vans cumberson to park in tight locations Good points Good safety rating Heating and air conditioning works well Nice safe orange rear turn signals instead of confusing red ones Engine is quite powerful but harsh if working hard Fuel economy is actually not bad on long highway runs
