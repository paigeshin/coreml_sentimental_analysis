 My father owns a 1991 Ford Econoline van and it the biggest piece of junk he has ever owend  The van rides well but it only has a 302 V8 and does not any power whatsoever  It has a spacious interior and alot of room but that is the only good thing I can say about it  The van averages only 13 mpg  you cannot see out of the rearview mirror and it has no acceleration and you cannot keep the front end aligned  This is not a good vehicle to buy in general  I cannot recommend this van to anyone  it is nothing but a 7000 lb  gas hog  That is my opinion on the Ford Econoline van br br
