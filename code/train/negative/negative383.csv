 I have owned a couple of these 1993 Ford Tauruses and they are great for roadtrips and long commutes  The less options  the better  I hate the transmissions they all go out in the 130k range  look for slips and  quot thunks quot  motor mounts are weak too  especially on the 3 8s  so don t mistake the loud thud upon accelerating with tranny problem  The starters are sketchy and these cars suck when they don t work  as you begin to realize that no one wants it  no matter for how little money if there are electrical or transmission problems  Don t spend more than 2500 for one unless the tranny s been rebuilt or replaced br br
