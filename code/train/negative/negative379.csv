 My family had high hopes when we bought our  new  Taurus from the Ford dealer  We thought of the great trips we could it this spacious and quiet car  We learned very quickly  The car was the most unreliable thing we had ever ridden in  When we owned it we went on about six long trips with it  four of those trips it broke down  It is relatively quiet and has a decent amout of space  but those are qualities you tend to overlook as you manuver through the oveflow baggage from the small trunk in an attempt to get out of the car to examine the broken engine  Actually the transmission gave us the majority of the problems  It couldn t handle long trips at all  This car is a lemon and should be avoided
