 I had in my head  a great review for the  2000 Ford Ranger  and then tires were recalled  That alone made me want to return my truck  Then to top it all off  I open up the newspaper and lo and behold   ANOTHER RECALL   This time it s the seat belts  This leaves me with the thought    quot what next quot i  I feel like I m driving a time bomb  ready to go off  I will share my thoughts and feelings about the   2000 Ford Ranger  recalls aside  but I really needed to let you know how the recent recalls have affected my opinion on my vehicle  I will never buy another Ford  ever again   The 2000 Ford Ranger  is a sporty truck with power  I had previously owned a  92 Ford Ranger   but with the 2000 model  Ford had jazzed it up a bit  It s an awesome truck for someone who wants to have the ability to haul with a pick up truck  and the easy handling of a car   What I like about my 2000 Ford Ranger b They made the hood look more like a Dodge Ram  I think this gives the truck the illusion that it is actually bigger than it is  The handling is sweet  The truck almost steers itself  You feel as if yo are just guiding the truck in the general direction and it is doing the rest itself  The cab is roomy  We have the extended cab but I noticed they had actually widened the cab from the previous 92 Ranger that I had owned  I love how powerful the engine is  It accelerates so quickly and smoothly  It doesn t feel at all like a truck   What I dislike about my Ford Ranger b  Well  aside from the fact that my tire could blow at any minute and my seat belt might fail  I really don t dislike my truck  Major tongue in cheek here  I do LOVE my truck  I don t the problems I ve had with the tires and now the seat belt so because of that  it makes me wish I had not purchased this vehicle  This is something I strongly dislike about my Ford Ranger  Honestly  if it weren t for these recalls I d have nothing to put here  The truck is beautiful and handles like a dream  It runs well  and gets decent gas mileage  crud from Ford anymore br br
