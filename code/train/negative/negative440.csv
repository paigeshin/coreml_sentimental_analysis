 I love my boyfriend dearly but his car is another story  His 1992 Mustang LX is a car I d love to shoot over and over again  I have had just as much experience driving this car as I have had riding it in  Driving it didn t use to be so bad until the car s mileage went up and of course  so did the repair bills  The car was bought with about 70 000 miles and it is now up to about 125 000 miles but at least it s still running barely Now I can understand that once a car gets older that repairs are going to be needed but it s getting to the point it is worse than mine and I didn t think that was possible The engine in his car is a 4 cylinder with  from the specs I saw researching on the web  is 90 HP  I almost laughed when I found this out  At least it beats a Chevy Metro  Surprisingly though  I was in disbelief on how little it had  if I m wrong guys correct me  because for a four cylinder it was pretty quick off a dead stop  From what I understand also is that this car is pretty heavy so I am impressed with this little engine  I will say though that the gas mileage hasn t changed that much on the car  except in cold weather  and it gets about 22 city and about 30 on the highway  At least with this car going to the gas station is a little less frequent then in my car  The handling  many many miles ago used to be pretty loose and somewhat stable and then I had more control over the car  As time passed and mileage increased the handling became slowly worse to the point that if my hands aren t holding the wheel with a tight grip the car doesn t want to stay straight and more and more the steering is getting very tight  I honestly never feel sure of myself driving this car anymore  You could say try an alignment job thing is  with this car you can t afford the money to keep up with the repairs  The heat in the car really can t be considered heat and the air conditioning in the summer is non existent and for someone like me who can t handle heat this a problem  There is also a possibility that this car also has a carbon monoxide leak and I have been encouraging my boyfriend to have that checked out as soon as possible  I really don t like the interior of his car either  It looks too cheap and well  it s just not as stylish as the newer models  The controls are similar to the newer models but the dash is just downright cheesy looking The seats are pretty comfortable though except it s very hard to use the lever to make the seat go up because those are breaking too  The center console is broken and even the ash tray cover at one point broke  which was probably my fault  The glove box has a lot of trouble staying closed especially when going over bumps  Forget about the back seat because with any Mustang you really can t consider it a backseat with how small it is  This car also doesn t have power seats or tilt steering so when I drive it  I basically need to sit on a phone book because without it I couldn t see the road  To top that off the wiper blades sit too high and can sometimes block my vision of the road The driver and passenger side windows are ready to break and are very loose and you can tell any time you go over bumps  The suspension is shot  If you hit a bump hard you are going to FEEL it big time  In fact  one side of the car appears to lean a little bit  With new brakes the car will come to a stop in a very short amount of time if you have to slam on the brakes but with worn brakes start praying basically  The car has a very noticeable  very rough idle  I have sat in that car before for at least fifteen minutes or more and eventually got sick to my stomach because of how much this car shakes  Sometimes at forty miles per hour the RPMs seem to stick and the car vibrates a lot  if anyone has any idea what that is please let me know  my car does that too  I will say though when you hit the pedal to the floor it makes a very nice sound  I love to hear an engine roar  even if it is a four cylinder I can honestly say that I wish he had never got it  The amount of money he has spent and still needs to spend on this car is absurd  The car is in need of some more repairs and I m sure of it  It seems like you can never keep up with this car  It s almost saying  quot please put me out of my misery quot  half the time  It would be easy to say  quot well  get all the repairs done and you should be fine quot  problem is  repairs were done and shortly after more problems came around  I know it is an older car and I know it has a lot of miles on it but for the amount of things to break it gets to be too much  The exhaust system  for example  was replaced and six months later it goes again and a new one is needed  The transmission even needed to be rebuilt but perhaps that was just age Maybe if Ford had made better quality parts that lasted maybe this car would not have had so many problems  I have written this as a warning to anyone who would consider buying a used Mustang of this year or before  You may end up like my boyfriend sinking buck after buck into this car just for things to keep breaking on it and wanting to pull your hair out  If you are young and just starting out like the two of us  being able to afford cars like these may be a challenge if your luck is as bad as ours  It is a nice looking car and a lot could be done to it appearance wise to make it look even better but I really don t think this car is worth the trouble  And with New Jersey s stricter inspection laws both my boyfriend and I are most likely going to have to take out loans just to keep our cars on the road to appease New Jersey regulations  But my view on these new laws is for another day
