 I bought a 1990 White Ford Probe in 1994  It had 60 000 miles on it  and according to my mechanic  was in good shape  It had a manual transmission  a sunroof  power windows  power door locks  and tinted windows  It drove very well  and it was my favorite car  but that did not last very long I had to take it to the shop to get a new transmission after having it only four months  I also had several other problems which I will not go into at this time  The culmination of the problems was when the engine BURNED up in 1996  I was driving down the highway when all of the sudden  smoke starts coming out of the hood  I pull over  look at the hood  and almost open it  before I noticed flames shooting out from under the hood  Luckily  I had a cellular phone with me and called 911 to get them to extinguish my car  The engine was totally melted which basically the car was totaled  I did not take any action against Ford  but if I knew what I know now  I would have  I have heard from at least two other people who had owned ford probes that the same thing happened to them The bottom line is steer clear of this car if you can
