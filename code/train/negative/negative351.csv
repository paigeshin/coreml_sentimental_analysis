 I have to begin with a disclaimer  there is no listing for the Ford Escort prior to 1992  There was a Mazda Ford integration in 1991 and all models beyond this date had significant changes in body style as well as engine specifications so some of the claims I make on this vehicle may not be valid on current models Please do not rate me down for off topic  I am not very auto literate  This epinion is part of a write off dedicated to roadiem  an advisor in autos as well as a gifted writer  someone who cared about others regardless of whether he knew them or not and who recently passed  I would politely ask that if you have the urge to rate down for this reason then please don t rate it at all  Any earnings from this post are for the family of roadiem I happen to own an Escort GT  I sometimes wish I did not own this vehicle but I don t seem to be able to part with it  I use it to travel back and forth from work and the drive from the Boise  Idaho area to the Portland  Oregon area  Primarily for the gas mileage  especially with the most recent ridiculous gas prices  I recently went to the greater Portland area to visit my oldest daughter for a week end  My gas mileage was about 35 MPG  I had no mechanical or electrical problems  This ugly little car is eleven years old with 112 00 miles on it  I find the convenience to be traveling about four hundred miles on about  15 00 more important than how I look This model was designed and produced before the acquisition of Mazda by Ford  It is the last year that the Escort was still fairly boxy in body style and attempted to be a  sports car  It is in fact rated a  sports car  for insurance purposes primarily  I was told  because it is a three door or hatchback model  Ford also attempted to give it a sporty look by adding a pinstripe decal  tail scoop and  low profile  tires but I see no justification in labeling any car with a 4 cylinder engine as a  sports car And the low profile tires are far more expensive than standard tires  Every time I look at it I have to fight the urge to peel the pin striping off Let me tell you what I do know about the internal workings of my beasty sports car  The engine is a 1 9 litre with fuel injected cams  I have no idea what the 1 9 litre spec is saying other than engine size but I understand the fuel injected part versus carburetor function so I can say something about that  I have never had to have the injectors serviced but I do add cleaners to my gas tank every three or four months  And I don t allow the gas tank to empty farther than 1 4 tank to avoid pulling  stuff  off the bottom  I am certain this is good for any car s fuel delivery system I have already stated that the engine was 4 cylinder and the big disadvantage in this is it makes for a gutless ascention to higher speeds ESPECIALLY on any incline  Gearing down can help but it is just a good idea to enter the slower lane if traveling a one lane highway when passing lanes are provided  If there has not been a passing lane for several miles and the grade has been somewhat inclined you should be able to easily spot a three mile chain of ticked off fellow motorists driving on your back bumper  It is just safer to get out of their way and look sheepish as they pass  You will be disadvantaged in an Escort if you have a need for speed  Declines are a different story and if you are like me by the time you have entered a declined grade you will be ready for a speed increase  Control this urge within reason or you may have to explain to an officer as I did the reason you are doing 87 mph in a 65 mph zone after completing an easterly ascent into the Blue Mountains which is about a 6 mile  6  grade incline  My best explanation is I had to begin my ascent at 120 mph just to reach the top on the same day and I was just beginning to slow down Mr  Officer was not amused but did warn me that there were patrol cars hidden about every two miles for the rest of the mountains  about 30 miles  and at those speeds I could easily have to file bankruptcy by the time I reached the end of the mountain pass  So I spent the rest of the day chugging through The choke is electric and apparently suffers brain freeze if exposed to lower than freezing temperatures longer than 49 seconds  The engine does stall but once it has started stalling you can get another 50 miles or so before it refuses to run altogether  I do not travel long distance in this vehicle during the winter months  The opposing weather condition of prolonged extreme heat can result in  vapor lock  which also temporarily disables all engine functions so long travels are only smooth in moderate temperatures  While on the subject of fuel one should know that the fuel pump here is a self propelling unit actually in the gas tank and within a year of owning the car I could hear it and I am certain anyone within twenty feet can hear it as well  It is lessened by a fuller tank giving less space for the echo effect of the closed tank  This can be very annoying  My solution is to turn up the music  The stock stereo cassette player is your basic run of the mill music provider  I am not knowledgable on these systems so I won t attempt to appear that way  If I can hear the music and the words are legible I am satisfied I have had no other troubles with this vehicle engine wise except I had to replace the water pump twice so far and the alternator once  I do think that is pretty minimal for a car of eleven years  I do wonder why the clutch has held up through all these miles because this is a common source of problems with most Ford compact cars So now I will tell you about the crawl space disguised as the interior  The color scheme is pretty boring  Gray on gray  If you are in the drivers seat it does feel like the steering wheel is attempting to rest on your chest and your wearing a waist down body cast  The back support is good and I rarely have a back ache even after long drives  If you don t begin your journey with an intimate friend you may be that way at the end of the trip as there is maybe 4 inches between the driver and passenger seats in the front The back seats are actually roomier than the front ones if you don t count leg room and the two seats will collapse forward to make a larger trunk  They also collapse independently if you only want half of the trunk larger Seat belts are in abundance with shoulder harness provided in the back seats and the annoying automatic shoulder harness in the front seats which generally scare your passenger if they are not used to them  These are very noisy and no amount of WD 40 decreases this  The driver harness jammed in the closed position a long time ago so I do not have to contend with it  The other problem with automatic shoulder belts is that it makes it hard to remember your lap belt which is not automatic The dash panel is easily accessible mostly because you are sitting on it  Standard Ford issue with A C included in the GT package  No extra or flashy details except the idiot light suggesting when to shift  It is my opinion that if one cannot shift by engine sound or read the magical tachometer then one should probably aspire to an automatic vehicle  I tilt the steering wheel at an angle that blocks this light from my view because I find it annoying  I also wish the engine warning display included an oil pressure display  I asked a Ford mechanic about this once and was told that if the oil can with a slashed circle illuminates on my dashboard then it is probable the block is already cracked  What the point is I don t know  I just make it a point to monitor my oil level  This car does not burn oil even now  economically a plus Here is my one and only epinion on an auto  I chose to write about this auto because it is the one I know the best  We also have a full size GMC Sierra  a Chevrolet S 10 king cab and a Mercury Villager mini van  Obviously there is a clash of opinion for vehicle manufacturer choice I have pretty much stayed true to Ford for most of my life  I suspect this is a subliminal choice as my high school boyfriend had a cherry 65  mustang and it was the envy of the school  I have taken a lot of crap throughout the years  especially from my GM mate  I just remind him that the paint is not peeling off of any of my chosen vehicles and the cost to us when his fuel delivery system crashed last winter     964 00  In closing I would like to say if you are looking for a dependable commuting vehicle with good gas mileage and fair to average comfort with below average repairs and low maintenance you may want to consider an Escort  Remember this is an epinion on a pre 1991 model  after that everything changed and I know nothing about that except I think the newer model Escorts resemble the Mazda 626  This car is not for the vain or the self conscious sort  I am old enough not to care  and I have more money for other things in the long run  The van is for family accommodations and the trucks are because apparently real men drive trucks    The Sierra has a lift kit on it  I get in it with a rope ladder   If you are looking for durability  low maintenance and good gas mileage then I can recommend this vehicle for these purposes  Would I buy it again  I don t know  when I bought it eleven years ago it was the best buy I could make with the resources I had available at that time  I don t really think it would have been my first choice if finances had been different for me then  But I have few regrets and it has certainly been a true blue friend to me for the most part Thank you for reading this post  it is my first participation in a write off  The irony in this is that when I first started writing at epinions I was curious about what these write offs were  The person that I posed this question to was roadiem and his response was prompt and encouraging to join in on one  He also had comforting and supportive comments to my postings about my struggles with my eldest daughter in the past  I did not know roadiem but it was easy enough to ascertain that he was extremely devoted to his family   friends and mankind  and womankind  in general  I am saddened to hear of his passing and offer prayer for the family  My deepest sympathies to any and all affected by his journey s end on earth  I am certain he will rise to the occasion of the next journey before him Others participating in this write off for roadiem are bjcuevas  naphtalia  seether166  sherrylee  mattjoe viper1963  gollygumdrops  noniaBidnis  nightshade 01 obnox
