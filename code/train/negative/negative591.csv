 I drove a company 96 Explorer XLT for six months  which was used on and off road  The Explorer is a comfortable ride and has ample cargo space as compared to my 88 Jeep Cherokee and other small SUV s  With the back seats down  the vehicle was able to hold all of my field gear while conducting drilling activities on a hazardous waste site  Believe me  when you work on haz sites  there is a lot of gear to be toted around  The duel open action of the back window and tailgate was a nice convience  since you could just open the window to retrieve objects  With the hinges of the tailgate on top  the tailgate would act as a shelter during rain events where note pad could be kept dry I was very pleased with the on road handling of the Explorer  but was disappointed with its off road use  The auto 4WD function was a nice feature that operated flawlessly during the wet season  That was the only thing I like about the Explorer for off road use  My biggest beef was the low clearance of the vehicle  Tree branches were snagged by the frame on two separate occasions  On one occasion  a stick interfered with the gears of the vehicle  I could not get the truck out of gear until someone crawled beneath the vehicle and pulled the stick out  Try that repair alone on an off road trail  Another time the vehicle slipped into the tire ruts from heavy equipment and bottomed out  I was able to get out by immediately gunning the engine  I was surprised that the vehicle came out of that situation considering the lackluster of past 4 wheeling  Several times the Explorer could not pull itself out of a muddy area without a running go  These were similar areas that my 88 Cherokee handled with ease  One note  the Explorer probably would have done better with real mud tires I loved the vehicle for its on road use but hated its overall off road use  Who should buy  Anyone who wants the status of an SUV and does not plan any off road excursions except for maintained gravel roads  Who shouldn t  Anyone that needs a good 4WD vehicle for heavy off road use Because of the lackluster 4WD experience and low clearance of the 96 Explorer XLT  I upgraded my 88 Cherokee to a 96 Isuzu Trooper  which is also reviewed by me separately br br
