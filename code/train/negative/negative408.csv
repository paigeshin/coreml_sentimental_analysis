 When we purchased this vehicle  what sold me was the way that it handled  I was afraid it was going to be like driving a bus but it handles like a car  We wanted a car that seated more than just 5 because we have children and the older ones are getting BIG The first complaint I had was the back bench  There s just no headroom  And when I say   quot NO HEADROOM quot  I mean that my 7 year old fits the seat just perfectly  Her head is just about touching the top We are very good with preventative maintenance but after a year of regular driving  we started to experience problems with the vehicle 1  When we were idle  the car would rumble and sound like it was going to cut off 2  The vehicle actually cut off a few times for no apparent reason 3  My ABS light would go on and off We took the truck to the Ford dealership several times before the warranty ran out throughout the first three years but they never found anything wrong  Now that the warranty has run out  three years after purchasing a brand new vehicle  the truck runs like an old  used  chevy truck  It s not bad  but I expect better quality  reliability and service br br
