 The 1990 Ford Taurus offered a comfortable ride for the two years I had it  But its list of problems are long and serious  Starting with the outside  the pain has a terrible habit of rusting at the edges of the doors  While you can sand it off easily and coat it again in paint  the rust simply keeps on coming back  The engine is louder and a poor performer for being a V6  Gas mileage is average at roughly 30  The interior has problems involving squeaky door panels and power locks which break  Idle can turn rough on a cold start  its very apparent when sitting at a stop light  the engine will rev up and down once per second causing the car to rock   a new O2 sensor did not solve this problem  By far the biggest problem with this car is the transmission  When it works  its sloppy  has a late  or no  downshift  and slips  When it doesn t work  you look at a  2100 transmission rebuilding estimate  The transmission shop confirmed that this car has major transmission troubles  My Taurus started losing fluid to the point where pouring fluid back was not sufficient  it leaked out the front seal the second the transmission was set in motion  While the car did its job  moving to and from school once per day  its not dependable
