 It s 8 30 AM and I am on my way to work in my economy Toyota  Cruising in the fast lane  I notice a Ford Excursion poking along in the slow lane ahead of me  As I get closer to passing it  I notice the wall of SUV next to me getting closer to me  I slam on my breaks and the Excursions back end barley misses taking off the front end of my Toyota as it moves into the fast lane in front of me  Did the driver even see me  Were they even looking  Maybe those big mirrors on the side weren t aimed low enough to pick up my car  If they d hit me  would they have noticed  Now driving behind the mammoth  I can see the silhouette of the driver  the only person in it  through the back windows  Ah  the driver is on a cell phone  I honked and flashed my lights  but I don t think they noticed  Okay  this review is not just trashing the Excursion  I m mainly writing it to bring up a few important points about large SUVs to consider before purchasing  As you know  large SUVs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about before purchasing  I recently purchased a new car  but considered an SUV first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind First of all  there are lots off hidden costs on large SUVs  like the Excursion  Of course  unless you have  40 000  to spend on one  you are going to have a high car payment  Which is obvious  most consumers expect this  But did you budget the high fuel cost as well  A Ford Excursion weights about 7 600 pounds  Because of this  it has a V8 or a V10 engine  Which means it gets 12 5 miles per gallon or less  the V10 averages 7 miles per gallon  My Toyota gets 7 times that mileage  Meaning that an Excursion driver is paying on average 4 to 7 times more for gas that a car driver  This will add somewhere between  175 to  350 a month to your car payment  Still think you can afford this  Then lets talk insurance  Because the Excursion is big and heavy  if the driver gets into an accident  like what almost happened to me above  it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for  On top of that  there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you  Which means you and or your insurance company could be out a lot of money  They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars  You should get a quote from your insurance company first Now  on average  the Excursion puts out over 3 times  or more with a V10  the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car  This really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this  One of the popular things is  SUV tagging  Where they ll put bumper stickers on your SUV say mean things like your changing the climate and you don t care about the air  Please check out the sites I have listed below for more information on this http abcnews go com sections us DailyNews madtaggers001225 html http www baaction org SUVticket index html http www idontcareaboutair com bumpers index shtml http www charm net marc chronicle suv may01 html http poseur 4x4 org topten html This is a new trend and who knows where it will go  But do you want to constantly worry about your expensive SUV being vandalized and then pay for the repairs  That s just more costs to worry about  Like keeping your vehicle in your garage  Not the Excursion and most large SUVs  they won t fit unless you have a custom garage  I bet that s expensive also  Or just leave it out side all the time and worry about vandalism One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families  For the most part  they are not  Especially Fords  The new VW Beetle gets better crash test ratings that most Ford SUVs and trucks  Do your research first
