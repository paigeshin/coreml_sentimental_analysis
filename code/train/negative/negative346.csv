 I recently rented a 2000 Ford Expedition for a weekend outing  and to road test the vehicle  There are alot of pros and cons with this SUV  I currently own a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe  and have not one complaint regarding the vehicle so far  it has went everywhere that I ve decided to take it  and not once has it skipped a beat in doing so  I rented this Expedition to compare it to the Tahoe  Well  there is no comparison  the Tahoe wins hands down for certain  The Expedition got an average of 11 miles per gallon throughout the whole trip  which was 3 consecutive days  I got it stuck in the mud 4 different times  which required a tow out of the mud each time  it handles terribly on and off road  and seems to me that it is underpowered for it s size  The Tahoe  on the otherhand  handles very well for a SUV  will literally smoke the tires on dry pavement  and gets anywhere from 15 mpg to 22 mpg  Do not get me wrong  the Expedition is a very comfortable  nice riding  luxurious SUV  and does have an abundance of qualities that alot of other automakers simply do not think of when manfacturing thier SUV s  I feel that the Expedition is suitable for the buisness executive type of consumer  that needs the four wheel drive occasionally  maybe to get to his her office in the snow safely  and get there in ultimate comfort  This vehicle is not made for the serious 4x4 nuts at all  it s simply not designed to go off road too far  and if you do  you d better have someone following you with a long tow rope br br
