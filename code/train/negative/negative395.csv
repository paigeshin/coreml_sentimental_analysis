 Buying a Ford Taurus from a used car dealer can be a good thing it can also be your worst nightmare  Buying a 1994 vehicle like the Ford Taurus that was purchased with 80 000 miles attached to it by 1997 my first question would have been whether or not these miles where highway or city or a combo  I m going to bet you the dealer lied  Keep in mind that most used car dealerships buy their cars from auctions at a reasonably lower cost than anyone will purchase them  The warranty is there as a convienence to the customer and the dealers  The dealers can and will set up vehicles to last just long enough  Something as simple as a oxygen sensor will in most cases be overlooked or simply pulled  cleaned  and reinstalled along with other things  Yes it does have room to breathe and the seats are comfortable but room and comfort won t get you where you want to go  Be careful to find the best dealers look for bad and good track records watch out for the quick sell  A vehicle that won t go over 65mph without dying on you would not be in my driveway  I totally agree with anyone who hates their Ford Taurus  A friend of ours had one  it lasted one year  Yes they put more money into this car then what it was worth  The worst mistake they ever did  By the way they no longer have it br br
