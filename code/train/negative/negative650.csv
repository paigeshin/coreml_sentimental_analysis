 Ok  we aren t rich  and can t afford a new car  but  I have had the experience of this thing  If I did have the money for a new car this would be one of the LAST cars I would pick  If I won a free one in a contest  I would sale it  Ok  We had a 1989 Ford Escort  2 door  This is a 99  4 door  RA was rear ended  This is the rental car they gave us to use  Ok  What I really don t like is the electronic windows  Which is a danger to me in a vehicle accident  being in the Ambulance for 12 plus years  electric windows and things of that make it a lot harder to access a vehicle once a battery is cut   have to take out a window if the doors are locked  The only thing that is not is the seat belts  Go figure  Our older Escort  had automatic seat belts and that s the only thing  I just find that funny Ok  the dash  center consul the radio controls and heat controls  all sort of blend in together  The dash lights come on automatically when the car is running  When night time comes and you turn on the head lights  the stupid dash lights dim  yeah there is a knob to brighten them  but not as much as we would like  It s not exactly easy on gas  as I was figured it would be  It uses more than our 10 year older car  Pretty much the same motor  We travel a lot  it s a hour to RA s family  So at least once a week we travel there  I didn t like the way this car rides  After half the trip toward his family  I decided I hate the way it rides  Never before   aside from when I was pregnant  have I gotten car sick on this trip  nor did my kids  We all ended up car sick half way there  and had to make a emergency stop  Something else  the baby would sleep most of the trip in our car  He carry s on at least half the trip in the 99  and I think its the way he rides in this thing too   Or maybe he can sense how uncomfortable we all are  I like driving the car  but RA doesn t  The sun visors are too small  The headlights  which can be moved a bit  are two low and outward  The worst thing so far  we were heading home  first really warm day  and we had the windows down  it started to rain  We smoke  I know shame shame  So up went the windows  Well when we cracked the widows to smoke  the design of this car  the water poured in the windows  They weren t even open a half of a inch  I have rode in MANY cars and had windows cracked open over the years  At least 8 off of the top of my head  and this is the only time that s happened Granted I will give you the safety features  have to have break depressed to put in or out of gear  Locks on master window controls so that only the driver can control all the windows  BUT that stinks because when it s on  I can t open and close my window The dome light stays on till you start the car or for a time after you get out   Talk about frustration  till we learned all these things out Also maybe you will find this funny as I didn t  and do now  The first time I drove this car after dark  after unloading kids  handing them bags sending them toward the house  I loaded up the last of everything into my arms and kicked the door shut almost losing half my load  The dome light didn t go out  So I butt bumped all the doors to make sure they were closed  swearing at the light still being on  I despirately with much difficaulty sat the soda s from Mc D s on the hood  put the bags from my hand on the hood  slide the bag from my wrist down on my hand and sat it up on the hood dug the keys out of my pocket and got six inches from the lock and the light went off  again swearing and kicked the car  got the stuff loaded back up and headed toward the house as RA came looking for me  Then laughed hysterically at me  only because he had done the same thing  making it back to the house and noticeing the light on till he got his boots on and back out side it was off  Ok  there is a button for trunk in the glove box  even if car is shut off   I don t like that part  but do in a way  like the child that died from locking himself in and with the keys  till they found him  they couldn t get him help  worth breaking a window to me that way to pop the truck with no keys but it makes it easier to get into for would be thiefs  Electronic door locks  with the extra by window button locks too   I like that a lot  Lots of trunk space  The only advantage this has over our older model  is three seat belts instead of two and four doors instead of two I just feel  I found more cons  with having this thing here for two weeks  With the many MANY other brands and types of cars out there  There is a lot of better choices to pick  Sure I gave you  a lot of things I don t like about this car  But I feel the pros are few  and this car would make a poor choice for anyone  Maybe that s because I don t have the money for a new car  Looking at spending that much on a car  I would expect it to be lacking any poor quality in ANY way it s made   I hope you understand what I mean br br
