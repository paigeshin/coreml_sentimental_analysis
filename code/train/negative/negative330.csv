 My 99 Windstar is a great van to haul my family of 5  The exception is a Engine  Spark Knock  noise  I first noticed it at about 7 000 miles  currently at 17 000  I ve been back to the dealer five times now and each time they say it s normal unless the noise is heard during cruising speeds  It rattles at cruising speeds  during accelerations  and  quot whenever it feels like it quot  I ve used all three different gas octanes and I still have the noise  The highest Octane works best but can you imagine my gas expenses for a van rated for 87 Octane  As far as fuel economy goes  19 MPG is all I can get out of my van  The engine noise is most noticeable in hotter weather conditions  The hotter it is  the louder it is  The noise is annoying and I believe will result in major engine repairs in the future as it seems to get progressively worst In my opinion  there is a mechanical flaw but I can t convince the Dealer or Ford of it  I also noticed on this web site that others have indicated an engine noise in their opinions as well br br
