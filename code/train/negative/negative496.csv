 When my 2001 Explorer Sport s transmission died  see my review  I ended up with a Ford Focus 2 door as a rental for the week Coming from a big and tall SUV to a small  city commuter  I was worried about the Focus being under powered but I was pleasantly surprised at the pep   even with an automatic transmission Engine Peppy for city driving   even with auto transmission  Highway driving is also smooth Interior Extremely cool dash design  Though the dash is ergonomically correct  some cost cutting is noticeable with the lack of warning lights and lights on buzzers  Front seats were firm and supportive  Rear seating   even in the 2 door   was fine for 2 smaller adults  Rear hatch stores a big trunk space Over time  however  the seat fabric has begun to wear  The Seatbelts anchor s plastic guards are cracking and the cheapie no tach dash is pretty uninformative Quality  revised Though the car started off very tight  fit and finish seemed to deteriorate after a year Overall Good design that seems to have suffered major Quality Control problems  Commuter car in the 2 door format  Much more stylish than a Civic  I did feel as if I was sitting very low to the ground   but then again  I was coming off an Explorer  The 4 door models lack the daring design of the 2 door and the station wagons are even more conservative
