 I am the victim of a 2001 Ford Focus ZTS  It s tragic that it is such a pleasant car to drive  How could a  nice car to drive  be tragic  you ask  Well  I have made two payments on the car and I have had two repairs on it  one rusty muffler  and a two hour stay in the dealer waiting room between the hours of 7AM and 9am  a faulty window which required two visits because of a mis judgement of the problem by the service techs  I think he said the car would be done by 5pm  it was done at 5pm 4 days later  Now I find myself frustrated since my door locks won t lock and there is a creaky sound coming from my front suspension whenever I go over a bump  Oh well  only 58 payments left  Looks like I ll be spending more time in the waiting room
