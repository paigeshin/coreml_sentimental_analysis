 I have now had the displeasure of owning two of these  quot vehicles quot  The first was my first car ever  then when someone ran a stop sign and hit me  totaling that one  my parents bought me another one  I ll say this  that was all the motivation I needed to save up the money on my own and by my OWN car The worst part about the Tempo was that I had the same problems with both of them  The oil leaks  the muffler rusting out completely  the shocks rotting out  I even talked to a ford tech to ask him what would be causing my car to smoke and smell bad if it wasn t over heating  As soon as I told him it was a tempo  he diagnosed it as an oil leak  And then he asked me if my Muffler had fallen off yet  it hadn t at the time but did less than a month later  That oil leak  a week after it started smoking  and on the day I had bought the part to fix it  CAUGHT ON FIRE  That s right  my car caught on fire in my friend s driveway  Thankfully since we were there to work on the car  we caught it before it did any damage Other various problems I ve had between my two tempos include not starting without recharging the battery when the temperature dipped below 30  which happened with two separate batteries  so it was definitely the car  busted alternator  the seatbelt motor not working  which cost  500 to fix and was required by law  One window s motor not working and being stuck up  two windows getting stuck down  SUCKED in the rain  a radio that didn t shut off with the rest of the car and had to be turned off manually  And  my personal favorite  the electronic fuel door release just stopped working  But that ended up working out for the best because at the time  the door itself had stopped shutting  I beg you not to buy this car  life is too short to make all of the mistakes yourself  sometimes you need to learn from someone else s br br
