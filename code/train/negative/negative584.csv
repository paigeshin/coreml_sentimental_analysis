 I bought a 1998 Mustang because I fell in love with the car the moment I stepped foot on the car lot  I bought it the same day I took the test drive  The car is beautiful and amazingly comfortable  Although Ford has great servicing for these cars  I am disappointed that within six months of owning the car I am having trouble with the engine  squealing tires  loose windows and creaks of every possible kind  I take great care of my vehicle and do not abuse it in any way  The problems started with a horrible clicking noise in my left front tire and seems to escalate to additional problems on a daily basis  It seems that I spend much more time at the dealership than I should  especially with such a new car  By the way  they do find something every time I go  I am not imagining things  I have often heard rumors about Ford cars  but chose to ignore them  It seems they might not be rumors after all
