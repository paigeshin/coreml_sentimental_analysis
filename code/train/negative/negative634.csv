 I owned the truck for almost 2 years then I sold it  Mechanically the truck felt good  allthought it lacked a little bit of power and was bad on gas  I would go for the 5 4 next time  I loved the truck it had a great ride for a large truck  I had the off road package which gave it bigger tires and higher suspension  But the overall quality was not good  Under 2 years old and the truck was rusting in many different spots  This was not just mine doing it  I talked to many other owners that had the same problems  Also the sheetmetal on the doors cracked and the paint chipped off  this happened around the window frame  and this is on every 1997 and up f 150  I also read they are having paint problems like they did in the early 90 s paint on the top surfaces are letting go  Not happy with the quality and was worried about the future of this truck  Since I did not lease  I financed I did not want to own a beat up old truck after 2 years or so br br
