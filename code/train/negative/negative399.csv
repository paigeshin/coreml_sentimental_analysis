 I recently was given a Ford Taurus to drive as my company car until my official car comes in  look for my review of that car when it comes in   either a Grand Marquis  a Ford Crown Vic or a Mercury Sable LS Anyway  I have been driving this for about a month  Its an OK car  but I wouldn t buy it  The interior is nice enough  but it is already beginning to show wear  The seats are comfortable and adjust well  but are nothing great The back seats fold down VERY easily  This provides plenty of room for me to lie my bike in without having to remove the wheels One annoying thing about the car is that the power locks only automatically unlock the front drivers  door via the factory remote  You have to hit the unlock button 2 or 3 times to trigger all the doors to unlock  So if you are driving  park it and turn off the car  when you step out of the driver door all other doors stay locked  Some people may like this  but it really annoys me As for fuel economy   NOT  This thing seems to suck down the gas faster than either my Jag or 4Runner  The car I was given is a very nice shade of blue and  as far as wagons are concerned  the shape is nice Driving the car is easy and it handles fairly well  Overall  it is a fair car  Nothing great  but not bad either
