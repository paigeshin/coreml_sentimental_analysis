 Let me start off by saying that when I leased my 1998 Ford Windstar it was in July of 1997  I leased it because it was rated number one in overall safety for mini vans that year I leased it for two years and when the lease was up my wife loved it so much that I purchased the vehicle for her  This vehicle is now 3 years old and has about a little over 12 000 miles on it When I leased this vehicle I thought it was covered by a five year  50 000 mile warranty  I was wrong it is only covered by a 3 year  36 000 mile warranty  After three years of driving this vehicle without ever having a problem the electric door locks started to malfunction  First the driver side would not lock then it would not open  then the side sliding door had the same trouble  when I finally got a day off of work I took it to my local dealer Island Ford on Staten Island NY  this is not the dealer I leased the vehicle from  and asked for the locks to be repaired  this is when I found out that my warranty had expired 6 DAYS EARLIER  They told me they would not fix the locks unless I paid for them    I was later lead to believe that it was because I did not purchase the vehicle from them or they would have taken care of the problem  I came home and called Ford  they said they would contact the dealer to see if this could be worked out and I should hear from Island Ford in 2 3 days  A week later I contacted Ford again to let them know I haven t heard from the dealer  they said they did the service manager refused to fix the vehicle  After days of haggling with ford and trying to go up the chain of command I finally get some guy who tells me my decision is final and nobody can change it  I wrote a E mail to Mr  Nasser the CEO of FORD and kept getting answers from different people but I could never get to him directly Their customer service is terrible Now this vehicle has locks that don t work because I didn t get there 6 days earlier and with only 12 000 miles on it  it sounds like the power steering pump is going  This vehicle is going up for sale as soon as the winter is over and that will END MY RELATIONSHIP WITH FORD FOREVER Whats your opinion  I d like to know
