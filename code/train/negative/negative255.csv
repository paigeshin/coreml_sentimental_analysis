 I currently own an Aspire and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it  One of the great things about this car is the mileage  I can fill it up and it will go forever  However this car really does not handle well  One gust of wind  and I am blown all over the road  I recently had a blow out going about 55 mph on the highway  The driving conditions were ideal  but I my car was thrown into the side railing of a bridge and the damage accrued from this simple blow out is going to be about  2000 dollars  This estimate is the average from 3 body shops  When the blow out of my tire occurred I really did not realize how much damage the little bang had done until I tried to change the damaged tire  These cars are not made well  I would not call them safe cars because of the amount of damage I sustained from such a seemingly simple fender bender
