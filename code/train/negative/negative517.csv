 For years I had heard favorable things about the Ford Taurus  So I took advantage of the opportunity to replace my  84 Reliant wagon with a 1995 Taurus wagon about six months ago  The car has been reliable  handles well  for me  I m no cowboy on the road though  and I really like the lockable compartment built into the floor of the rear cargo area  But the Taurus has lots of annoying design shortcomings  that aggravate me daily For starters  after locking the car with the electric door locks  all you need do to open the car door is use the handle   no need to actually unlock the door  This  feature  places children or others  such as my aged mother  in peril  since you need not actually unlock a door in order to open it  There may be childproof locks for the rear doors  I haven t checked that out  since I don t transport young children  It also means after I exit the car from the driver s side  if I want to access another car door to remove something  I have to remember to unlock ALL the doors  before exiting the car  The radio sound is of decent quality  but I hate radios with all pushbuttons  since you actually have to take your eyes off the road in order to turn the radio on or change bands  A raised circular power volume knob would increase operability for this radio immensely  Once the radio is on  there is a convenient button located near the steering wheel that allows you to scan previously programmed channels in the current frequency band  either AM  FM1 or FM2  You can also adjust the radio volume using another button near the steering wheel  The radio also seems to be much more susceptible to outside electrical interference than the radios in any of my other cars  Buick  Olds and Chevy  forcing me to actually turn the radio off sometimes on my way to work  Road noise also competes with the radio much more so than in my other cars I have a power seat with the car  This feature is great to have  but once again  Ford engineers have screwed it up  There is very little space between the left side of the seat near the floor and the car door  Located in that small space are the power seat controls  the rear gate release and the gas tank cover release  Needless to say  everytime I reach for the gas tank cover release  I hit the power seat buttons  moving the seat in some unpredictable way  To avoid this  I always open the car door  just to release the gas cap cover  The release doesn t actually pop the cover  by the way  It only releases it  Thus gas station attendants will stand there  yelling at me or motioning at me to pop the gas tank release when I ve already done so  To be fair to Ford  I did buy the car used  and maybe in a new car the gas tank cover does actually pop open when you hit the release button  My oldest car is now a 1992 Buick LeSabre  I mention this only because in that car  the front arm rest doubles as a storage area for tapes  change and has a cupholder for two cups  In contrast  the 1995 Taurus  built 3 years after my Buick  uses a ridiculous split front armrest  thus wasting the space other manufacturers have cleverly exploited for storage  Oh  there is indeed a cup holder that can be pulled out from the dashboard  But its placement limits the size of the cups that can be placed there  A 20 oz cup of hot coffee must be mildly distorted and angled to fit in the cup holder  and more than once the cup has opened and spilled its contents upon removal  You also can t remove the cup or replace it without actually looking at the cupholder  once again limiting its usefulness I m not sure how to characterize the interior passenger space of the Taurus  Two adults can fit comfortably in front  and two adults plus a child will fit comfortably in the rear  But the car is just too narrow to comfortably fit 3 adults in either front or rear  However  the wagon does have a third seat that can be popped up from the floor of the rear cargo area  so  in principle  you can cram 8 occupants into the vehicle  although not very comfortably in my opinion Gas mileage with the car  with mileage approximately evenly split between highway and city driving  is about 20 miles per gallon The Taurus wagon has both a rear defrost button and a rear windshield wiper button  Unfortunately  the rear defrost control is not located with the other heater and air conditioning controls  and it s actually hidden from my view when I m seated in the driver s seat  so I ve always got to hunt for it when I want it  The rear windshield washer button is also obscured by the steering wheel  another annoyance Overall  I m satisfied with the Taurus  but the poor human engineering will keep me from buying one again
