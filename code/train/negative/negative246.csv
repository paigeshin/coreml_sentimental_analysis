 Well  I don t exactly own this car  but I have driven in it plenty of times over the last few years  It is my neighbor s car and we used to go many places in it until I got my Corsica  This review is on a 90 Escort LX 2 door HB  THINGS THAT WENT WRONG This vehicle has only 98 000 miles on it but yet is breaks like it has 198 000 miles on it  This car needs one significant repair at least once every two months  Sometimes more  From what I can remember  these things went wrong Both door armrests and handles  inside  have fallen off The ignition system needed replaced radio died A C died the headlights broke  electrical  and cost well over  200 to fix washer fluid pump oil leaked and needed fixed water pump died map lights stayed on and would not turn off which drained the battery clock won t work right engine had some problems auto trans is going to go bye bye soon brakes wear out fast and there have been many more problems that I don t want to bore you with Now  back to the review Interior exterior The exterior is nothing special  however  the back end is quite nice looking  The wheel caps are nice too  The front end looks big and old with the large   80 s volvo like headlights  The interior is small and very cramped  The back seat cushion is tilted funny which makes it uncomfy  There is little leg room in all four seats The rear two seats have a lap belt with a separate shoulder harness  They each have their own buckle  There are coin holders below the shift lever and in the locking glove box  They add a nice touch  You have to be small to drive this car  Tilt wheel  What tilt wheel  This car doesn t have one  To me  a tilt wheel is a MUST  The seats are high off the floor and the lower cushions are thick  The sun visors are very nice and have a covered mirror with lights  This is a plus  Under the hood Under the hood of the LX  you will find a weak 1 9L four Cyl  engine  The brake oil washer fluid  and coolant fluids are easy to fill and find  The transmission and the power steering dipsticks are NOT EVEN LABELED  She had to go to Sears and ask a worker which was which  There is a light under there so you can see at night Please be sure to be VERY careful when buying this car  If you aren t rich  then DON T buy it           FYI  My neighbor bought a brand new 1994 Escort and sold it within a year because it was ALWAYS in the shop                       John9740a s own ratings  1 low  2 3 4 5 high Power 2 front seats 3 back seat 1 trunk 2 brakes 2 reliability 1 room space 2 overall 2 5 but due to reliability  I have to give it only   sad stars
