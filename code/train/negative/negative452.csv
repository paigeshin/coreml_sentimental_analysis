 I knew that it was pretty the moment I saw it on the lot  it was so gorgeous  coming and going  I was proud to drive it  when I drove it  however  I never knew when I was going to get home first month  run sluggish when hot  we live it Houston  Texas  it will always be hot  that is not a good sign  however  frequently it would just not run  it would just suddenly stop second month  tire separation  we are cruising along the freeway  toodling along and the rear tire completely separates  thanks to some Firestones that came on the car  and not only did we get a flat tire  but the tread separation took the rear bumper off  lovely third month  motor mounts and wheel rotors  okay  fine  it was used  it had less than 50K miles on it  maybe that was reasonable  coolant flush  why  smelled funny to the mechanic  coolant smelled burnt  I blamed the service station for trying to pull a fast one  my bad fifth month  over heating  again  called Ford  nope  not their problem  whose problem  do not know  but FORD said not their problem  fine  sixth month  transmission  slipping on corners  great  I know what a V6 is supposed to sound like when cornering under a freeway over pass  this is definite slippage  high RPM s no increased acceleration  solution  new transmission seventh month  hard starting  wonderful  I am loving this car more each day  solution  new battery  this is not my idea of fun  I want to go out into the garage and just get in and go  I do not want to plan ahead each day for when I will need a jump start eighth month  more over heating  mechanic still cant find the problem  I am learning to nurse it by turning off the air conditioner and keep it going so that the breeze would keep the water cool in the radiator  it would limp home ninth month  rotor cap and wires  anything to convince it that it would start in the morning and not burn up batteries tenth month  serious serious money spent on the best truck battery  Interstate  that would definitely turn this car over the radiator eventually cracked  the head gaskets eventually did blow  out of warranty  and the transmission did go out again  all within 110 000 miles  FORD  customer service sucks  I will never ever buy or recommend any FORD ever again the room in the car was unparalleled  the class of arriving in this car was great  It is a pretty car  but sadly the car itself mechanically was horrendous  I am religious about maintenance  about repairs as soon as there is a problem  I have never hated a car before  but I hate this car
