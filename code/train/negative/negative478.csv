 i recently got an oppertunity to drive an expedition in Dallas Tx i will admit it does have a good look but it s made by ford  I will also admit i have been a chevy man since i was a kid  The expedition does have room though the seats were not really comfortable   And it does have plenty of cup holder s  this truck is good for that mom or school teacher who like s to run a rat pack of kid s to their soccer or basketball game  It s loaded with options decent stereo with cd changer  when i got the expedition on the freeway  i was not impressed with the acceleration  It seemed to take off as if though it was a six cylinder  Now from my understanding these thing s come with a v8 which i believe is a 4 9 litre engine  Compared to chevy s 5 7 litre i know there is no contest here  I also noticed they have beenm recalled for tires falling off brake mastercyliders failing  and sorry gas milage  I wouldn t own one even if they gave it to me Remeber the four dangeruos word s kids  Ford stands for  fixed or repaired daily  So if you have been brainwashed from child birth to purchase ford motor product s flame on   If you are smart and do enough research   You will see how often they see a shop  Also note friends don t let friend s drive ford s see also www consmer reports com ford recalls  don t say i didn t warn you
