 I just bought a used 1996 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor and am not a very happy camper  I belong to a volunteer highway safety organization and was in the market for a new  used police car as my  93 Ford Taurus was on it s last legs  After spending several weeks searching all over trying to find a used Crown Vic police car to my liking and that did not break the bank I finally found one at a dealer located two hours away from my home  The dealer who specializes only in used police cars was highly recommended by a friend of mine who has bought three cars from him and has been very satisfied with the cars overall So  after two trips up to the dealer and looking at dozens of cars on the lot  I settled on a  96 Crown Vic police intercepter model with 95 000 miles on it and a rebuilt transmission  Part of the catch was the price which was several thousand dollars less than I thought I d end up paying  This car seemed perfect in every sense for what I wanted and needed  The only problem was that I wasn t able to test drive it on the road because it hadn t been properly prepped  So I was limited to driving it around in the parking lot of the dealership  It seemed fine in the lot  but the lot and a road are two different dimensions when it comes to testing a car s handling  You may say that I should ve known better  but I figured that a car with a police package was supposed to handle well Before making the final decision on the Crown Vic  the dealer suggested that I test drive a  95 Caprice police car he just prepped for a sale latter that day  He mentioned that the Caprices handle better than the Crown Vics  I took the Caprice for a spin and the handling seemed nice and the engine was amazing  But  I had my heart set on the Crown Vic I ve just always liked the look of it much better  and figured that there would be little difference in handling between the Caprice and the Crown Vic because after all  both cars had police packages  Boy  was I ever wrong  The day I picked up my Crown Vic it had been completely checked over and prepped by the dealer  I was eager to take it for a spin on the open road to see how it handled before handing over the check  To my surprise the steering seemed unusually oversensitive and the car seemed to ride very awkwardly around bends  The dealer reassured me that  that was typical of the Crown Vics and it was possible that the car just needed an alignment  I figured that I d just have to get used to the different handling  So  I handed over the check and drove home with the my new  used Crown Vic  A few days later  I took it in to my trusted local mechanic to have it looked over with special attention to the steering s oversensitivity problem and my mechanic said everything seemed to have checked out okay  He couldn t find anything really wrong with the vehicle that might cause steering or handling problems and he came to the same conclusion as the dealer   that Crown Vics were just built that way Well  now I feel kind of confused and upset because I had expected the Crown Vic  especially the police package  to handle much more nimbly overall  My  93 Ford Taurus with 140 000 miles on it  shot front shocks  a ball joint and tie rod about to go and power steering that gave out long ago still handled better for the most part than this Crown Vic  In a way I wish I had gotten the Caprice  but I didn t know better at the time My advise to anyone considering purchasing a used Crown Vic police car  or for that matter any used car  is to test drive it thoroughly and see if you can live with it s handling  I ll have to try to learn to live with the Crown Vic s handling unless I choose to sell it which I m not quite ready to do yet  The reason being that in the last 24 hours I found some useful forums and sites on the internet that discuss problems with the Crown Vic police packages and some suggestions on correcting them  So to end on a little bit of a positive note  there still may be hope for this Crown Vic and me  But  I don t have a lot of free time in my life to devote to fine tuning a car to ride decently that should have been built that way to begin with  I will be far more careful next time before jumping into a car purchase based mostly on my preconceived conceptions and test driving limited to the parking lot  p s  One owner of the same year and version of my car responded to a message for help I posted on a used police car bulletin board and he suggested having the alignment done by a mechanic that is familiar with the special needs of a police package vehicle  He said that having the alignment done properly on his Crown Vic improved the handling enough so that he decided to hang on to it  I will update this review as soon as I have the alignment done on my car in the next week or so br br
