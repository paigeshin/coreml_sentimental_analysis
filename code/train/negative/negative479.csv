 I have expressed my dislike of SUVs in many of my earlier reviews  but as long as my relatives continue to buy them  I will continue to write of my displeasure when driving them  Ford s Expedition is now sadly a  quot mid size quot  SUV despite the fact that it in itsself is a monstrosity  The car  with its massive size offers an unwanted guarantee that it will kill the passengers of any car you come into collision with  My closest friend s husband died in a collision with an explorer  a smaller car  and the child driving the Explorer is still emotionally wounded  However  it still is ridiculously flimsy  and suffered  2500 of damage once in a five mph collision with a garage door  Of course my biggest pet peeve is mpg  This car gets a ridiculously low mpg of nearly 10 in the city  I think it would be more environmentally sound to clear cut ten acres of rain forest then drive an Expedition around for ten years  As usual  I have experienced another SUV and grown to hate it  I recommend buying any car that will not waste fuel and kill passengers of other cars you may collide with br br
