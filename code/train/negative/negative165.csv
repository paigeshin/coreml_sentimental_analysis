 It amazes me to go through all the internet resources and realize what a wide spread problem the Ford company has with head gaskets  I have always liked my Taurus yet at 47000 miles it is falling apart  Since February 2000 It has been in the shop 4 times  My warranty doesn t cover head gasket repair  which is what my independent mechanic says is wrong with it  Ford will not take the word of an independent mechanic only a Ford mechanic  First they said it was the overflow tank which I had replace in March due to rusty  leaking water Now in May I have rusty  leaking water again  the dealership says its not a head gasket   now it s the freeze plug and I need a bypass kit  Anyway I am frustrated and I would like to hear anything related to the 1996 Taurus  I can sympathize  By the way my car has been very well maintained and loved  Please send any information or horror stories to C85k87n90 aol com Thanks
