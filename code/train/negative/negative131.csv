 I am the proud  well  sometimes proud owner of a 1995 Ford Mustang  I have found other owners of the same type of car as well  However  it s strange because we have all seemingly had the exact same problems with our cars  I bought this car in 1998 and here are the following repairs that I ve had done on it since then  I bought the car with 42 000 miles on it  so it was fairly new August 98 Gaskets Had to be replaced  found in many pieces Fan had to be replaced  found in many pieces Fan motor blown out Several hoses replaced due to fragmentation and tears September 98 Gaskets replaced for 2nd time  found in one piece November 98 Clutch had to be replaced  At this time I was at 48 000 miles  found in many many many pieces March 99 New tires destroyed when wheels somehow tear through them June 99 Had a total car tune up done  spent almost  700 to get car in good shape September 99 Gaskets blown out for 3rd time  found in several pieces Hole in Radiator October 99 Gaskets blown out for 4th time  found in several pieces January 00 Belts replaced and gaskets blown out again  5TH TIME April 00 New tires needed as alignment mysteriously got put off and the tires were just bought not even a year ago and have a 50K warranty on them  Only 20K miles have been put on car since the tires were bought April 00 New brake pads  rotors  brake kit  etc needed on front and back brakes Now  I ve compared this with other reports from other owners of the same car and I ve found continuing problems with the gaskets being blown out and parts actually exploding  rather than just wearing away  I had taken it to several different repair places so that I made sure it wasn t just the Ford repair centers  but it was actually the car  I ve found another 5 mustang owners of the same year with exactly the same gasket  radiator  and basically cooling system problems  So  I m pretty much starting to assume that their is a major design flaw in the Mustang and that something needs to be fixed or these cars need to be recalled and looked at  It s becoming quite expensive to fix them all I love the Mustang and I know the older cars are worthwhile  but I m starting to doubt the newer models  I ve heard more bad than good about the never models and their repairs than anything  Be very cautious br br
