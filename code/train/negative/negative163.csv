 I purchased a 1996 Ford Taurus program car with 18 000 miles on it  From day 1  I have regretted that decision and will until I am rid of this lemon  I use my vehicles heavily and in the last year and a half  I have put 60 000 miles on it  I maintain my vehicles well  but for this car  it didn t matter  In 1 1 2 years  I have replaced the entire front end assembly three  3  times  replaced the transmission  and replaced the cam sensor due to hard starting  None of these repairs have fixed any of the problems with this P O S  I have written several letters to Ford to express my deep displeasure and concern with an inferior product and to my dismay  no responses were ever given  It is easy to see that Ford is perfectly happy to create an inferior product to sell to the U S  public No way would I ever recommend to anyone a Ford Taurus  I have a 1996 and have driven a 1999  The only good quality this vehicle has is that the ride is very smooth  although the front end assembly clunks when you hit the slightest of bumps br br
