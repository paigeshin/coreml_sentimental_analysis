 I bought this vehicle used in  97 and for the most part was satisfied but leery  The vehicle served us well  but for a couple draw backs The ride was comfortable if a little noisy inside  and seats were excellent  Configuration was OK  and we enjoyed and miss the electronic dash that came as an option  As far as draw backs go  we drove it on vacation to Myrtle Beach from Ontario Canada  and on arrival  fortunately  the head gasket blew  as per the Ford recall  they would only replace blown gaskets not fix on spec  Ford was good  I was in the States as a Canadian  and covered it  including towing  100 In the final days as owner we had numerous problems with the ignition switch and undetermined mis shifts from the transmission  The ignition switch was  replaced  twice and in the end left my wife stranded road side while I was away on business  This was the final straw and we parted ways  myself and the van  not my wife  I was leery of the transmission noises as the van is rated poorly for transmission problems and my fears in this regard contributed to our decision to go Japanese and get a 2000 Sienna  All in all I did not hate the van  but feel much as one does when a trusted friend starts to talk behind your back   betrayed br br
