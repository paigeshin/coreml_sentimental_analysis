 The Ford Windstar has both good points as well as bad  We were sold on how comfortable the car was to drive and ride in  I also have to haul equipment around in it so the room was also a plus  About one year after we had the van  we experienced out first trouble  It was strange  The car would not go in to third gear  staying in 2nd instead of drive or over drive  We brought it to the dealer for repair and got the surprise  No the car was not pregnant  we needed a whole new transmission on a year old car  In the mechanic s ramblings we learned that he had to do this kind of work a lot on the ford minivan line  While the comfort of the van was luxurious  the hassle of having to get a major repair so soon after receiving the car was too much of an event to convince me to lease another ford  The warranty of course covered the repair but I have to assume that this can happen again  the new transmission can from the same people who made the year old one  I return the van in three months and I think I ll get a fuel efficient sports car br br
