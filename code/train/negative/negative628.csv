 Being a mechanic by nature my first reaction to this suv is to stay away from it and I will tell you why  First and most importantly to me is what this vehicle holds in store for me or any consumer how much will it cost for repairs Large or small   well i will tell you that if properly maintained you will get a long life out of these but  when it comes time for suspension work or even exhaust work you can expect a large bill when the work is complete and the garage has had your suv for the whole day  Suspension parts wear quickly on these for some reason weather or not you take care of them  For instance the ball joints and tie rods are non greaseable and weather or not you go off road with this you will need to replace them Generally at about 40k miles  If you were to replace all 4 ball joints on this vehicle be prepared to spend between 300 and 400 dollars  In My opinion these parts should last at least 50k maybe even 60k if the vehicle is well maintained  Exhaust repair will end up costing you about 200 00 due to rotting tail pipes and mufflers   at least in this part of the country  On the plus side of this vehicle is its handling and fuel economy and the comfort level is high I just dont like to repair suspension that soon and if you put off repairing the suspension remember your tires are next  Over all with its decent fuel economy and roomyness it is an ok vehicle  my personal Preferance is the chevy s series in my experience these vehicles last longer
