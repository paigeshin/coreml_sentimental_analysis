 My first stop for car shopping was Toyota  due to my previous experience for reliability  The mini van was too mommish  amp  the SUV ceiling seem low  floor board high I then went to Ford  because I liked the look of their SUV  enough room for 2 young kids  amp  all the consumer magazines gave it overall good ratings  After one week  3 different ford dealerships  amp  more than eighty percent for a down payment  I should ve taken this as a sign Once I finally purchased my 1999 Ford Explorer XLT  I really loved it  I had the few options that were important to me  the fleet representative was very nice  the finance was within budget  amp  the insurance didn t dent my pocket Well  I was into month 5 8000 miles of owning this vehicle  when I notice the transmission starting to slip  I took the car to the dealer for a recall issue  amp  mention the trany slips  of course the repair gentleman thought I didn t know what I was talking about  It wound up the cylinoid bracket was a factory default  The parts had to be ordered  amp  should be in within a couple of days  I was covered for car rental for 5 days  but it didn t pay for the insurance  Week one goes by  amp  no call from the service dept  I had to contact them  because the rental was only covered for 7 days  The parts were still not in  amp  Ford then had to place me in one of their rentals  A ford Taurus  OK  I should say  thank you  they gave me something new The rental agreement was for  5 a day   1200 max coverage  Everyone knows  1500 probably wouldn t cover a dented bumper  After numerous phone calls to the service dept  claiming the parts hadn t arrive yet  I call their service mgr  who never returned any of my calls  so I had to go a step further I then mailed a certified letter to ford informing them of this issue  amp  letting them know I was aware of the  lemon law  I also sent written notifications to the California Consumer affairs  cartalk com  better business bureau  amp  other consumer advocates  such as those we see on TV By day 30 of having my car in the shop  amp  23 days of rental on a ford taurus  the service dept calls me  informing me my car is ready how convenient  day 31 would ve qualified me for the lemon law The gentlemen in the service dept who kept in touch with me regarding my car stated that I caused some problems for them  Oh  did I mention that particular Service Mgr was no longer at that dealership This incident left me with nothing good to say about ford  If they had told me after week one  my car would ve been in the repair shop for a month  I would ve known what to expect  temporary insurance change  so I could feel safer about driving their vehicle if nothing else Ford did cover my rental expenses  and my car seems to run OK  but I plan on trading it in before the extended warranty runs out or I pay it off  I don t want to end up like BeccaM  Now  I know why I haven t owned an american car within the last 20 years  Next time i ll go with what I know Toyota  I wouldn t recommend my worse enemy to purchase a ford I ve only owned 3 brand new cars and this was the first to give me problems within my first 100 000 miles  Usually  they fall apart after the warranty has expired or you ve paid it off After reading all the positive epinions of Explorer owners  looks like I ended up with a  quot LEMON quot br br
