 The Taurus was a great car when we bought it in 1996  Low mileage everything worked fine  And extremely comfortable But then 1999 came and boom  At 100 000 kilometers the air conditioner quit At 120 000 kilometers the head gaskets blew  Then at 155 000 the transmission had to be completely rebuilt  This 1994 Taurus gl was equipped with the 3 8 engine  I have learned never to buy a product with the ford 3 8 engine  The car is now gone to the scrap yard at 185 000 kilometers This car was a very expensive lesson to learn Ford did rebate the money for the head gaskets But not for any of the other repairs which I believe happenned due to the faulty ford 3 8 engine Whatever happenned to cars lasting 10 years  Keep in mind as you read this article that I have used kilometers not miles 100 000 kilometers   60 000 miles br br
