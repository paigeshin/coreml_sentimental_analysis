 I have 1995 Ford Windstar that now has 72000 miles on it  The van is great to drive and the interior has worn well and still looks great  But mechanically the poor Ford has had it I had to replace the head gaskets at 70000 miles  Which was a  1200 repair  This bothered me but I figured after 70000 miles it could be worse  I then found out that Ford knew this was a problem with all of their 3 8 liter V6 s that year and even had a program to replace the head gasket for free if the van had 60000 miles or less  I contacted my local Ford dealer and Ford s  quot Quality Care quot  department  both said they could be of no help because I had more then 60000 miles on the van  So I went ahead and had it fixed 3 weeks later while returning from a funeral out of town the van broke down and left me on the side of Interstate 81 in the middle of the night  I had the van towed back home only to find out that it had broken a connecting rod and I have to replace the motor  A  3500 repair My next vehicle will be an import  I also have a 1987 Toyota with 149000 miles and have never done anything to it but oil  tires  amp  brakes Maybe one day Ford will be able to build a quality product and when they let a bad motor get off the production line they should stand behind it br br
