 The Ford Econoline van was not only a mechanics worst nightmare but also the owners  This van had numerous problems including severe break problems and an overall rough ride from light suspension  The brakes had to be replaced at least every four months and the suspension seamed to always  quot bottom out quot  and not provide enough suspension for even the regular trip around town  Sure this van was nice for carrying people and cargo but mechanical problems put this van on the bottom of my list  So if your looking for a van out there I believe that you should shop around some more and definatly not look in to the Ford Econoline van unless your up for a rough ride and spending money on brakes every four months  I really do not recommend this van to anyone  The ride was horrible  it got about ten miles to the gallon on gas  and used up your money in many other ways br br
