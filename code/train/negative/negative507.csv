 All I can say about this car is  yuck  I can t wait to get rid of it  Everything rattles  squeaks  and knocks  Paint is peeling off of the side view mirrors and the hatcback hydraulics are shot  The passenger room is close to non existent my fiancee is 5 5  120lbs and she complains about space  The interior materials are cheap plastic and crack very easily  The controls are inconvenient and hard to reach  The back seat is a joke  The shift action is  squishy  and non responsive  The engine sounds like it is going to blow at 3200 RPM s and the acceleration is obscenely non existent  It has this mysterious stalling problem at times and the CEL light pops on and off at random times  It handles  OK  I have previously owned an Integra GSR  and a Nissan Maxima  both of which I was sad to see go  especially after owning this pile  I have even owned a 1990 Subaru Loyale that I liked better than this car and I had to change the alternator in the Subaru 3 times and the tranny once  This is the worst car that we have ever owned  Don t buy
