 My roomate recently bought a 2000 Ford Explorer Sport  The SUV is really nice but it is too bumpy and can flip very easily  The front seats aren t very comfortable and the back seat is awful  I feel like I m sitting on a big pile of wood  If you are going to have 3 people in the back make sure one of them is a kid so they can sit in between the seatbelts in the middle of the seat  At least the child is small enough to where they don t sit on them  They hurt pretty bad when you sit on them  The back hatch or 3rd door is nice but really heavy  If you are a woman you will probably have to use two hands to pull it down to close it  Now for the side doors  after a few months of opening and closing the doors they get to where you have to slam them shut  It starts to get very hard and annoying to close the doors  If you own and know about the  quot free quot  oil changes that you can purchase for 2 or 3 years  have all your paperwork with you the first and second time you go to the dealership to have it done  If you don t and Ford doesn t have you in the system or says that they have never heard of that before  you will end up paying for it and fighting with Ford to get your money back for that oil change  After 1 or 2 times it gets better  They usually have you in the system by then  The body of the SUV is really nice but not nice enough for me to own one I ll have to stick with the Chevy Tahoe in this category br br
