  Sick of politics  After this election year  who wouldn t be  I mean  all those amusing bumbles and hyperbolic exaggerations  luckily  things have subsided for now  until 4 years from now  that is  But do exaggerations exist elsewhere to fill the void  Let s try one   the new Ford Escape has just set the new standard for mini SUV s  Any response to that  Will the media clamor to call me a liar  I think not  Why  Because the Escape  has  raised the bar on this class  and other car manufacturers had better fall in line  quick  Still  there s a caveat  and it s no less important to consider before going out and buying this vehicle b The mini SUV class offers several choices  yet still offers you little  On one hand  you have the small  car based  underpowered toys like the Honda CR V and Toyota RAV4  although it s been redesigned  and on the other side  you have a relative behemoth  the Nissan Xterra  In my opinion  the only compromise in this class was the Suzuki Grand Vitara  until now Many reviews of the Escape on this site describing test drives came out when the vehicle just came out  This made little sense to me because a glitch in the vehicle s steering forced dealers not to allow the car for test driving purposes  in my city  at least  At any rate  when I finally received the phone call that I could  I was there at a moment s notice  Here are my impressions b EXTERIOR  8  As you may or may not know  Mazda had a pretty large role in creating the design for this vehicle  The Mazda version is sold as the Tribute  and has a few cosmetic and option differences with the Escape  but essentially the two cars are identical  The design is a unibody construction  which automatically lands this vehicle as more of a  road  cruiser than  off road  warrior  Still  the vast majority of drivers out there are going for image and or carrying capacity  so not too many will complain about that The Escape is what Ford needed to enter the small SUV fray  It s the smallest SUV in its model line  and is just a little shorter than a Honda CR V  It sits on 16  Firestone Wilderness HT tires  no cause for alarm here  and has a ground clearance of almost eight inches  which make it a decent beach cruiser or very  lite  off roader The rear tire isn t mounted on the back like other sport utes in its class which saves you tons of money in the event of a rear collision Do I like how it looks  Does it matter  The decision is yours  of course  I have seen the Escape photographed with more aggressive rims  and liked that look much more  If I had two words to describe how it looks  I d say  actively pedestrian  I prefer the Mazda Tribute s exterior to this one  it has more of an elegant flair to it that I find appealing b INTERIOR  7  Okay  let s hit on the  pros  here  the dash is a user friendly design  with everything readable and within reach  The white faced gauges  XLT model  are quite nice as well  What s more  you can fit up to 63 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seats folded down  Not bad at all for this class  Bikes and camping gear should fit comfortably  that  is  what you re considering this vehicle for  right  I was also quite impressed with the interior room provided for front and rear passengers  In fact  I d say that no other SUV in this class really sizes up well with the Escape in this category  save for the Honda CR V  There are plenty of very useable cubbies and pockets for you to store your stuff  too  including two nicely sized cup holders that don t get in the way of things  The air conditioner works fine  although the cooler weather here didn t give it a great bench test  The in dash CD sound system is decent  at best  an available MACH system would definitely be on my list of must haves The  cons  Oh  there s the minor things  the column shifter felt strange and ambiguous  kind of like one found on an 80 s Buick station wagon  if that makes any sense  I didn t find the seats particularly comfortable  although the material did seem like it could stand up to some abuse  Perhaps the available leather option would help things out a bit  no models on the lot had the option  so I couldn t try it  But  those are minor things after all  There s  major  problems too  though   The most glaring fault of the interior is  quality    Even if we were to ignore the fact that hard plastic abounds in this SUV  I guess it s to be expected  it was very hard for me to ignore the fact that the bottom door panels were coming off and I could see the metal underneath  Equally hard to ignore was the tinny  clang  sound the doors made when I shut them  a far cry from the Suzuki Grand Vitara s  thud  A small rattle seemed to be coming from the front of the dash on the passenger side when the road got a little bumpy   ENGINE  10  When I reviewed the Suzuki Grand Vitara  I said it had an engine that was the perfect size for its class  Well  I was wrong  The 3 0 Duratec V6 that is available on the Escape certainly levels the playing field  I have yet to see an SUV in this class that has as much off the line grunt as this one does  Like a few of the reviewers here  I agree that power does start to weaken as you hit highway speeds  but I still would call this vehicle a very competent highway passer  The Escape s base engine is the one found in the Focus  2 0L 130 hp Zetec four  I didn t try it  but would strongly recommend the V6 option  Ford predicts the V6 model will outsell it s four cylinder model  The 200 hp Duratec V6 is taken from the Ford Taurus  in fact  the larger of two V6 engines offered in that car  The Mazda Tribute also has this engine available  The automatic transmission makes sophisticated shifts  and hesitates only a little when the pedal is floored b RIDE  7  For an SUV  Not bad at all  Sure  there s more road and wind noise than I d like  The engine also makes itself known all too often  perhaps some more insulation would help  Still  there s other aspects that should be praised  On the highway  the suspension makes this SUV a nice cruiser  Bumps are muffled very well  and there is very little annoying rebound on nastier irregularities   HANDLING  8  Out of the mini SUV s that I ve driven  the Escape is certainly one of the best compromises of ride and handling  No  I wouldn t call it cat like  but easily  car  like  There is very little body lean during everyday driving  I took a turnaround curve at a speed that I thought was too fast initially until I realized that the Escape was holding up admirably  Braking is very impressive  once again car like  In fact  further research indicated that the Escape stops  better  than some cars   Car and Driver  made the Escape stop in only 171 feet from 70 mph   0 mph  which is the best they said they had seen in a production SUV  Wow The Escape is primarily front wheel drive  although it does send power to the rear wheels if it detects any slippage  Just my luck  it was raining the day of my drive  and although the Control Trac II AWD system probably engaged during the course of the day  I never noticed it  There is  by the way  a 4WD switch for full time 4WD  which I did use later  Not surprisingly  there is no low range setting for serious off road treks b SAFETY  7  The Escape is equipped with your usual features like airbags and ABS  XLT and upward  I definitely would chalk some points up on the Escape s behalf as far as braking is concerned As for offset crash tests  the Escape didn t fare too well  scoring  marginal   one step above  poor   rankings are as follows  poor  marginal  acceptable  good  In other crash tests performed by the NHTSA  the Escape did better Front driver  five stars Front passenger  four stars Front side impact  five stars Rear side impact  five stars Rollover rating  three stars b RELIABILITY  5  Ahh  here s the caveat I alluded to in the beginning  you thought I had forgot  didn t you  I have always  always been wary of an introductory model car  and I urge you to consider that yourself  In fact  the Escape Tribute was scheduled to arrive sooner to showrooms  but quality concerns delayed things somewhat  I have already read of a few recalls on Edmund com s Town Hall  where the discussion topic is called  Mazda Tribute Ford Escape Problems  The few quality glitches that I picked up on during my drive  the rattles  the paneling coming off  didn t help things too much  either  Would I  dis courage you from buying it now  Yes  Would I  en courage you to wait a little while to test the waters first  Yes  Obviously  I m probably going to get a few nasty comments from happy owners  and that s all fine and dandy  I m happy for you that after 4 days of ownership nothing has gone wrong  But what happens when you hit 20 000 miles  Or 40 000 miles  I ve been studying cars for a long time  and  be careful  is all I have to say b VALUE  9  When it comes to dollars and cents  the Escape makes plenty of sense  I made a rhyme  happens all the time  can I borrow a dime  The V6 XLT I had included all the features I would require  minus the MACH stereo  These included the V6 engine  ABS  cruise control  an in dash CD player  air conditioning  remote keyless entry  power everything  and fog lamps  All for a price of around  22 000  I feel this is a very appealing value quotient that is being offered here  especially considering the amount of power that the V6 engine provides b THE VERDICT  WHY MUST I ALWAYS BE THE ONE WHO S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT b This vehicle has a lot going for it  The only serious  and it is important  glitch is the concern for quality  I will watch how the Escape performs as the months pass  If and when I am proven wrong  I will change my tune faster than Al Gore changes his personality or George W  Bush can say  subliminal  For now  however  the  caveat  stands as pretty stong opposition to the  new SUV standard  that I spoke of  Once Ford addresses these issues however  and they will  other small SUV manufacturers had better adjust  or the electorate will leave  em without votes b AVERAGE SCORE  7 63 out of 10  b VARA S PERSONAL RATING  until reliability reports improve  7 0 out of 10
