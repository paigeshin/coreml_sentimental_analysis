 I don t even know where to begin  This car  while I had it  had so many problems  It seemed like everyday  there was another problem  First of all  to be fair I ll list the good parts about this car  its 1 6 liter H O  engine does produce a lot of power for a small engine  I have actually beaten V8 Chevy s and Fords off the line  And it cruises with no problem at high speeds  That s probably about the only good thing about this car  The car itself has a very bland boring design  It actually looks pretty ugly   Don t ask me why I got it  The interior is very cramped and there are no back seats Problems 1  Leaking winshield and sunroof 2  Car is so loud  you can t hear yourself think 3  When you turn the vent on  all you get is a smell of gasoline 4  Interior smells horrible 5  Handling stinks  and power steering squeaks when you turn 6  Shocks and suspension are horrible  can feel every bump on the road 7  Horrible gas mileage  15 19 mpg  and I thought this was supposed to be an economy car 8  Frequent problem with the engine  Overheating  burning and leaking oil 9  Car spent more time in the mechanics garage than mine 10  Half the options on the car failed  cruise control  AC  etc  Ok  this is pretty much my message  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR  Its not worth it  for  1000  treat yourself to a vacation or something  You ll definitely need one after dealing with this car
