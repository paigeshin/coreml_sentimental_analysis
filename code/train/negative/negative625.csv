 I used to drive a fantastic little 1986 Chevy Nova  A Toyota in a Chevy suit  but it finally got too old and wobbly  I went on line to research replacement cars  I considered the Toyota Corolla  Honda Civic and Ford Focus  but ended up with the Ford ZX2 for a number of reasons When I bought it  it was 2 years old and had 25 000 miles on it  but I got it through the Ford Certified Pre Owned Vehicle web site  It came with a no haggle price of  8 600 and a 12 month warranty  At that price  the best I could do at Toyota was a three year old Corolla with 60 000K My ZX2 is silver and pretty cool and sexy looking for such a cheap car  I drive it back and forth to work every day and cram my two kids in the back at weekends  I get to work much faster now   the car wants me to drive above 80 mph at all times  But at that speed the gas mileage is only about 28 mpg and the car is NOISY  The kids say it s even noisier in the back The car is pretty comfortable for me   I m a medium sized woman   but my 6 4 quot  husband doesn t like to drive it for more than 1 2 hour at a time  And when I had to put a couple of grown men in the back last week  I wasn t sure I d ever get them back out I think the trunk is generous and the cup holders are fine  but the glove box is way too small   once you put the owner s manual in there  you only have room for three cassettes and a Kleenex I ve had the car for a year  and once last year some kind of pin in the axle or wheel fell out   I ground to a halt and had to get towed  but they fixed it for free and that s the only problem I ve had br br
