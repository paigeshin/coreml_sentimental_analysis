 The first time I saw the Silver 1998 Ford Mustang  I new I  HAD  to have it  Needless to say  I drove it home that day  I bought the vehicle  because it had the sporty appearance that I was looking for and it really was not that expensive  compared to a lot of other sports cars  What I love about this car  aside from its looks  is the fact that the power is there when you need it  It gets really good gas mileage and of course  my kids love the fact that there is a horse on the steering wheel  The only downfall is that the back seat is not very roomy  Right now my kids are small and there is plenty of room for them  but I cannot see an adult being too comfortable sitting in the back seat  The car handles really well and is easy to maneuver in and out of traffic  I recommend this car to anyone in the market for a car with a sporty look at a decent price  By the way  the electric adjustment on the drive s seat is a must
