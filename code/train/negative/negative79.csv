 Don t personally own a Ford Explorer  but can tell you it s not for me  I have ridden in a few in my time and I am not pleased at all  Yes they may be roomy  yes they may have comfort options and extras  but not for me  Personally  I am not all for extremely large vehicles  I believe barges should float on the water  not on four wheels taking up the roadway  Granted  if you have a large family and need a sporty type utility vehicle  you may appreciate the roominess that the Explorer has to offer  As a person who doesn t like not being able to see out of her personal car  I would not want to drive this  let alone attempt to back it up  park it  or heaven forbid  parallel park it  I wonder how many people have actually driven these monsterous crafts to take their driver s license exam in  I would speculate so bravely as to say that unless you drive a tractor trailer on a daily basis  you d probably fail the exam  Personally know a mechanic who complains of working on these vehicles way too much  They are a busy operation and they see about 10 15 of these each week with many problems  Don t consider them too dependable  For the price  I don t think I would be too pleased  If I were going to pay that kind of price for an automobile  I d just as soon go by a sports car  At least then I could see what was beside me  behind me  and yes  even in front of me
