 We bought an Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer in 1995  We bought the car with a tow package and routinely used it to tow a popup camper  We loved the interior of the car and the way the car looked In the winter of 97  the car had 46 000 miles  We were moving to the Bay Area for 6 months and had rented a small U Haul  My husband was driving the car out to California  when in the middle of Nebraska  the transmission gave out  A Ford Dealer came out tow the car into the dealership  His comments to my husband  quot Didn t you know you cannot tow with a Ford quot  We had to totally replace the transmission on this car  All attempts to contact Ford to help with the payment were met with denial  We even Federal Expressed a letter to the president of Ford about this issue  3 months later we received a form letter We have found out since then Ford has awful issues with their transmissions  Check out all the web sites about this  We sold the car immediately and have since owned a Mercedes M Class  Great drive and great tow  and a Chevrolet Suburban 2000  WONDERFUL Do not waste your money on this car  It will fall apart on you and Ford will not care br br
