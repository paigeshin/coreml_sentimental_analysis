 I bought this vehicle because of it s 5 star safety rating  as well as cargo room and passanger room  We are a family with 3 small children and needed a reliable vehicle  which was safe  roomy  and reasonably priced  Since we bought it it s spent 50  of the time in the shop  Although many things were covered buy the warranty  several were not  We bought it used in Feburary of 1999  4 weeks after we purchased it the first engine went due to head gasket problems  2 days after we bought it the engine went once again  due to poor installation  2 weeks after that the transmition went  In less than 20 000 miles we ve also replaced the air conditioning  the water pump  the temperature guage  and several gauges and sensors  Which does not include regular maintenance  car rentals due to constant shop time  time lost from work or aggrivation  Just last month the head gasket had to be replaced once again  It has an oil leak  which although has been brought to the attention of 3 different dealers  we have been told there is nothing that they will do to fix it  The transmition is leaking fluid on a quart a week basis  Quite possibly the most annoying fact is that ford is offering a  quot buy back quot  program for the windstars currently  and because they have covered most of the problems   lt although not all  and certainly not car rental gt  we are NOT eligible for these programs  NOt that I would buy another ford  Ford s customer service has been unresponsive to our problems  and dealer s continueally refuse to return calls  Not only would I not recomend this vehicle to anyone  I wouldn t recomend dealing with ford either  Before we bought it we had heard nothing but good opinions  and coincidentally  as they all reached 50 60 ooo miles  they all began having massive problems br br
