 Yes  I am not kidding  After only 9 000 miles and none in 4WD my dealer informed me the weird rattling noise I was experiencing required a new engine  Six weeks for the new engine to arrive  Two weeks in the shop with no loaner vehicle  I picked up my brand new truck with it s even newer engine to hear the noise again Another three weeks at the dealer without a loaner for me  a Ford engineer examined the truck and the customer service rep examined the issues and my request to buy the truck back  the problem was determined inherent Warning I have heard from reliable sources  the service people and others on line  this is not inherent   Ford knows about the noise and is refusing at this time to buy the trucks experiencing the noise back   specifically 1999 3 0 V6 4WD  Just thought you all should know br br
