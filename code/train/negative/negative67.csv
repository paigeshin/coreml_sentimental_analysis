 About a month ago  I purchased a new 2003 Ford Explorer XLT Sport  4 door not to be confused with the 2 door Sport  Major options I chose were leather  moonroof  and a 6 disc in dash CD player with 7 speakers  A few other nice touches that came with it are the auto headlamps and auto dimming rearview mirror  I didn t want the 3rd row seating and it was difficult to locate one that didn t have it  but my dealer came through and located one for me   I d rather spend the extra cash on leather instead of a 3rd row seat that s hardly ever going to be used  The Sport package on the XLT upgrades the tires from 16  to 17  with different aluminum wheels  and includes side step boards  door handles that match the color of the vehicle  and platinum painted cladding and fender moldings  These cosmetic touches are minor but really do make the vehicle look a lot nicer  In fact  these features are also part of the much higher priced Eddie Bauer package I like the exterior styling of the Explorer  It s simple yet tasteful  and not overly done with cheap looking plastic cladding or gimmicky stuff like that  It s not a Hummer and doesn t pretend to be one  One exterior feature worth mentioning is the rear hatch  Most SUV s have a rear window that flips up in addition to the whole hatch opening  Well the Explore has this feature as well  but the window plus a portion of the door flips up which makes it easier to put stuff in the back since you don t have to raise a bag of groceries for example  above your shoulders to load through the opening  I am extremely pleased with the layout and quality of the materials of the interior  The quality of the leather is great  and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels solid  The gauges are nicely laid out  again nothing fancy  There is a compass and temperature display with the digital odometer  The CD player is mounted high on the dash  which I like  above the A C controls  There are 3 cup holders  an outlet to plug in a cellphone  and a very deep floor console that stores a lot of stuff  The pockets in the doors are spacious and formed so a large water bottle can fit  Pretty cool  The audio system sounds awesome  and there are a lot of cool settings to change the output to suit different tastes and styles of music This SUV rides so nicely that I have to remind myself it s not a car  Of course  it doesn t ride as nice as a car  but it rides MUCH nicer than any SUV I ve ever been in before  It doesn t have that pick up truck feel that most SUVs have  When you hit a bump  you don t bounce up and down for another 100 yards  The 17  tires really grip  and the month long snow storm that just fell where I live put the 4WD to the test  and this baby passed with flying colors  At first I was a bit skeptical about the 210HP V6 having enough power for an SUV of this size  but that thing puts out enough torque to move it nicely and has a surprisingly nice growl to it  The size of the vehicle is nice  also  Not too big  not too small  Some friends have told me that they think the SUV is huge  but I remind them that it s about a foot shorter in length than a Ford Taurus and the same width  and they are always surprised In general  I am very pleased with my Explorer and think it was well worth every penny  I can t think of any one thing that I can complain about  As I mentioned  the gas mileage isn t great but it s better than I anticipated it to be  I always find it ridiculous when SUV owners complain about gas mileage  If gas mileage is important to you  then don t buy an SUV  To me  it s like a biker complaining about the safety of their motorcycle  Anyway  before I get off on a rant quality appears to be Job 1 at Ford again
