 MY family has leased a 1998 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Version for 3 years now  We have been fairly happy with it considering there are 3 kids and 2 adults  WE have had more than our fair share of problems with this  truck  which i will explain later on  This car is best used on the highway considering it gets horrible gas mileage in the city and its still not that great on the highway  I would suggest leasing this car instead of just plain buying it becuase you dont want to buy this car and turn around and hate it like lots of people i know  There are several pluses to this car though 1  No one will ever cut you off or get in your way  and i mean never 2  Very safe in crashes 3  Good in wintry conditions such as snow but bad in ice since there is such a high center of gravity 4  Seats 8 5  Lots of storage space 6  Fairly nice sound system 7  They are very inexpensive at the dealerships right now 8  Removeable back seat Now for the not so good things 1  Insurance is sky high 2  Horrible gas mileage 3  Tons of mechanical problems 4  Loud 5  Drinks fall out of cup holders 6  Antena gets scratched if you go in your garage so in about a year you have to spend money to get a new antena 7  Vary hard to park 8  Bad turning radius 9  Possibility to flip over 10  cd player is in center counsol so you cant change cd s or anything while driving 11  Hard to wash 12  Very expensive to get repainted or get fixed Now for the problems we had 1 Windows got stuck and would not come up all the time during the summer 2  Oil leaks constantly 3  Winshield wipers wear out in about 4 months 4  Paint peeled 5  Tons of problems with our fule pump 6  Leather on seats tor for no reason 7  Winshield wiper on back window never worked and never will I suggest getting a smaller suv such as a cherokee or explorer
