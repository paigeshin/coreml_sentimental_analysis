 Update on August 25  2003  I need a new A C compressor and coil  adding another  1000  to the repair bill  So in my first 13 months out of warranty  I ve replaced 1  Idle Control Valve  Summer 02   250 2  ABS modulator  May 03   1000 3  Rear differential gears  May 03   1300 4  A C compressor and coil  Aug 03   1000 Plus had to pay for a car rental during three of the above TOTAL   3 900 including tax and car rental I ve rounded down in the above  Plus you can add routine maintenance to that figure  Without my extended warranty  which picked up over 90  of the above  I would have been much better served by simply leasing a new car for 3 years rather than keeping my car for this additional year I ve also changed my buy recommendation from a  Yes  to a  No  keeping in mind that this review is for a 1999 car  If you are buying leasing a new car under warranty  go for it  it s still fun to drive   Original Review from May 2003 First off  let me say  I love driving the car  I have a manual transmission GT  when I don t do a lot of heavy braking  It s extremely fun  and there s nothing more satisfying during rush hour than blasting around some guy that s going to slow for your mood The main reason for writing the review is to share with people some of the less documented potential pit falls  My biggest beef with the car  and with Ford  is my braking system  Approximately 6 months after buying the car  and literally over night  my brake pedal went soft  I can depress it 2  without noticeably observing a change in speed  More scary than this  on an occasion when I emergency braked  the pedal went all the way to the floor  The ABS did kick in  but it was scary  And  if I brake heavily while the tires go over bumps  the braking pressure becomes inconsistent  not to mention that steering goes to hell to  needs support  I ve twice rolled into the middle of intersections because of this  It s been to two different dealerships over four separate occasions for this specific problem  and no diagnostics have ever convinced these guys to replace anything  So I drive on  If the dealership won t recognize a problem  I guess I just don t have one  right The second thing you may want to be aware of  is that at 45 000 miles  and a little under four years old  the car needed  2800 worth of work  The ABS system failed  I have no idea if this is related to my first brake problem  but replacing the ABS modulator did not fix that problem  and my differential fell apart  A bearing went bad and ended up chewing the gears there  Those  plus the rental car I needed during repairs  plus the 45 000 mile service  400  added up to my  2800 bill  I m also not writing because I m mad about the cash outlay  I have an extended warranty that covered most of this expense  I do think that  2800 is an extensive bill for non accident related repairs to a 3 or 4 year old car Beyond these things  I ve had my door handle tightened up as it was falling off and my clutch replaced  although that may have been due to me learning how to drive the car  and not doing the shifts correctly I don t pretend to know if this is a reflection of a normal GT  or I m just unlucky  I will say that I take pride in the things I own  and I take care of the car  Oil changes and regular services  And I don t abuse it with donuts etc   although I m awfully tempted sometimes  Hope this helps you potential buyers out there  As a side note  the seat head rests are useless  but as I point out to my friends  you don t buy this car for it s reputation of comfort or reliability  It s all about the fun
