 A few years ago while I was doing an internship in Los Angeles  moving from place to place  generous volunteers who d put us up for a few weeks each  I rented a white Ford Escort to load all my stuff and drive to a few places  It was the cheapest car they had for rent  and I didn t have much choice  as only one rental place accepted drivers under 21 years old to rent their cars  the surcharge and insurance are ridiculous First  the car looks okay  It reminded me a lot of my dad s old 1991 Ford Taurus  especially the sloped front and the sloped headlights  In fact  it s like a  quot mini me quot  version of the Ford Taurus  Visibility is great all around  and I sat high enough on this car to be able to see everything around me  The stereo  cassette player  was pretty terrible  I had the windows rolled down on the freeway and listening to the radio at almost full blast and the distortion was awful to listen to  I could have rolled up the windows  it s L A  smog central  after all  but I like driving with the windows down  The car felt solid though  and I didn t feel unsafe in it at all  except  read below The interior is intuitive  The gauges and controls are where they belong  Nothing annoyed me  which is a good thing  The seats were a bit too firm  but then I didn t buy this car and had to live with it I had the 2 door model  and I loaded a lot of stuff in that car  I was impressed by the space in this  quot subcompact quot  car  The drive was what I expected  not spectacular  but enough power to not get blown away on the freeways  This is definitely a great  quot point A to point B quot  kind of car with great fuel economy  I think I got a few days of driving off a quarter tank of gas  and I drove a lot too Now  the most annoying thing about this car is the automatic seat belts  I never understood this stupid invention  It works like this  The across your chest part of the seat belt is actually  quot buckled quot  by default  and when your get in the car  it stretches between you and the steering wheel  When you close your door  the part that is attached to the door frame  quot slides quot  back to the pillar next to your seat  And then you re supposed to buckle up the lap part of the seat belt yourself  Now did you catch the stupidity of that concept  Let me explain  if you re making  quot automatic quot  seat belts  the stuff should automatically buckle itself up with no help from you  Instead  it s  quot half automatic quot  you have to buckle the lap belt yourself  otherwise you re not doing yourself any good  it s like not wearing belts because you say your car has airbags  Another point  if you happen to get in the car  close the door and realize that it wasn t shut tight  and then you open the door and close it again  the seat belts slide back and forth and back upon every door movement you just made But the real gripe I have about this concept is that I am an injured victim of such brilliant invention who lives now to tell you about it  albeit with some permanent war scars to show for it  You see  the first thing I do when I get into a car  without any nanosecond of thought  is to put on my seat belts  Always  even if I m just backing out of my garage 15 feet to wash my car  yes  I m that anal  So naturally  I get into this car  close the door and immediately reach for the seat belts  Whoah  The belt isn t back there  Oh no  Here comes the belt  Sliding into position like a roller coaster out of control  Bam  My fingers are caught on the rails as the belts slide into the pillar  OOOOOOOOOOOuch  It takes a good second or two to realize what just happened  and then a loud scream and other profanities lurching outward from my mouth  and then I realize that I ve been attacked by the seat belts  I quickly open the door  and the thing backs off  taking a good chunk of ectoderm  skin  with it  I m bleeding  A lot  Blood everywhere  Not as bad as the brains in the movie Pulp Fiction  but pretty bad  Now how do I explain this bloody shirt to my boss   quot Uh  my car attacked me quot And you know what s sad  I did it again a few days later  even after spending a good meditative chanting session  telling myself that I will wait two seconds for the belt to do its thing before moving any part of my body  Yes  twice  Same bloody mess  This thing is dangerous So as you can figure  if a car has automatic seat belts  I get no where NEAR that car   quot Thanks for offering me a ride  but I ll take the bus instead  On second thought  can I ride in your trunk  It ll be much safer for me back there quot  This stuff should be outlawed  Anyone know who invented this thing  The inventor needs to have his her patent revoked and be subject to having his her fingers caught in the rails of the belts AT LEAST two times  Sheesh br br
