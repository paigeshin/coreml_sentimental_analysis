 This entry level version of the iconic pony car looks muscular  from the flared wheel arches to the bumped up hood to the angled real lights and the agressive  mean   front headlights  Overall  though not classy or subtle  I find the shape attractive Loading up luggage is not a piece of cake  the boot is deep and wide  but the narrow opening makes it rather difficult to insert big items  A large size suitcase can barely be inserted  and as a result blocks access to the remainder of the trunk space  While on the topic  the glovebox is very small too  The instrument panel is clearly laid out  looks the business  Standard radio CD works decently  but the old fashioned telescopic antenna sticking out of the front right wing is anachronic  The headlights switch is a surprising design detail  I don t know if it echoes a feature of the original Mustangs  but its looks and its feel are really out of place  pulling on this button and hearing a whine when you rotate it to adjust the instrument backlight is the kind of heritage that contemporary buyers will easily want to do   without The front seats are not uncomfortable  but lateral support came really short of my expectations  Exploring the grip limits is a spine bending experience and makes you feel really uncomfortable  The fabric they are made off is cheap synthetic stuff  and the fit between parts forming the dash and central console does not leave a lasting impression of quality  wide gaps  mistalignment  leagues behind german  japanese  or maybe even korean standards The steering wheel  while a tad too big in diameter  offers good grip  an adequate thumbs in position  and is thick enough  The steering column feel remains quite numb however  the steering is not overly assisted  but does not communicate much about what s happening under the front wheels If I were to single out the one thing I disliked most about the car  it would certainly be the 4 speed  or rather 3  overdrive as I later discovered  auto transmission  Start from the fact that the gear change is located ridiculously far forward on the central console to be naturally within reach  The 4th  overdrive  gear is  as frequently  ridiculously long  making it really usable for highway cruising but a real annoyance in mid speed winding roads  As the overdrive engages as soon as you lift the throttle  it makes uphill or downhill driving a frustrating experience  2nd feels too short  The only remedy is to play with the overdrive off button concealed on the side of the lever  took me a while to discover it  Another gripe  the car I had was new  3000 miles  but the transmission sounded like a 300 000 miles yellow cab  with a vacuum cleaner noise in 1st and 2nd gear  torque converter   which sounded out of place at best  worrying at worst  Upshifts were not too smooth  contemporary gearboxes can achieve much better results  and downshifts felt busy and clumsy  not the seamless power on demand response you can obtain from german or japanese 5 speed automatic gearboxes The engine itself is decently torquey  max torque is reached at 2750 rpm according to the spec sheet and the car feels that way  but  for the sake of comparison  a GM V6 like the Pontiac GrandAm s is far more convincing  both in terms of grunt and noise  Redline is low  5300 rpm  and there is little incentive to rev it up that high  the engine does not sound rev happy at all  The car  equipped with standard 16 inch wheels  felt decently planted on its wheels  with grippy 225 tires  Turn in remained a bit lazy but the body roll is kept well in control   The Mustang goes where it is requested to  but there would be about as much feel as with a Playstation game  Visually  17 inchers would not look or feel out of place at all  The rear displays a hint of mobility  read tendancy to oversteer  although it is quickly tamed by the  switchable  anti skid control  The absence of a blocking rear differential may cause occasional inner rear wheel spin  especially on the wet  If you are seeking to be the king of power slides in the neighborhood  a V8 GT may be a better solution  The live rear axle is clearly perceivable through occasional sideways wobbles on uneven roads  not overly disturbing at a restrained pace  but likely to upset the car s balance at the limit  I would say that the chassis is good enough to cope with the 190hp of the base V6 without too much drama  but without too much competence and margin either
