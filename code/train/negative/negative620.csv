 My ZX2  I have had mine ZX2 for a little over 2 years and less than 25 000 miles  I have disliked it greatly from the get go  EXTERIOR I really like the exterior  It is sleek and a little stylish  A 2 door coupe with a little attitude INTERIOR A lot left to be desired  The dash is cool but impractical  There is no easy way to upgrade the stereo or any other in dash component since it comes in that nice oval box  The cup holders are good for small drinks  They are not good for the standard 32oz fast food drink  Large cups hit the controls for the AC  The interior is a little cramped feeling if there is more than the driver in the car  The back seat is impossible to get in and out of  On the plus side the back seat is roomy The center console is small and does not hold CDs very well  The door pockets are small and pathetic  The ZX2 does leave a lot to hope for in the way of storage inside the car PERFORMANCE The ZX2 has a lot of get up and go  This will be great for you if you do mind feeling like you are riding a tightly bound rubber band  The gear shift has also been stiff and unmanageable  It has just gotten worse after time  It is very difficult to go into reverse  COMPLAINTS I have had a lot of problems with this car  The brakes continually popping even after that got replaced twice  The door seals and trunk seals leaking  have fixed fixed only a dozen times so far  If you drive the car with any speed the gas mileage is much less than the sticker claims it should be  On top of this everything seems to rattle  I have never had such a loud little car  Overall I would not suggest the ZX2  May be it has gotten better since 1998  I did get one of the originals  It was only on the lot about 1 2 a day before I bought it
