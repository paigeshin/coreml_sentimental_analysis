 If you thought that the GMC Chevrolet Suburban was big  wait till you see the 2000 Ford Excursion  This vehicle dwarfs even the biggest of all SUV s  And in the race for the biggest and the baddest SUV s Ford takes the cake  Outside the vehicle closely resembles the Ford F350 with its front and grill  There is plenty of chrome to make it glitzy enough  It s big  The step in height is high even for a tall individual  and it takes quite some effort to get in  The tailgate is gigantic with two doors that swing wide out to the sides  Once inside  you will be lucky if you can get inside  you will notice an abundance of space  but it s not much more than the smaller Suburban  It s comfortable  but again a Dodge Caravan is just as nice in the inside as my opinion  The Limited version has a leather and wood interior and seating for up to nine  although most cars are outfitted for seven on eight people  It is comfortable and there enough space even in the way back  The vehicle is powerful enough for passing effectively on the highways and is comparable to the Suburban in accleration  But the handling  the handling is TERRIBLE  It s a truck  it s a truck disguised as a SUV  It s hard to maneuver  and the turning radius is horrible  If you are in the market for a vehicle with a lot of room  and with all wheel drive that can handle in the snow  a much better choice than the Excursion is the Dodge Caravan with all wheel drive  It s better on your wallet too  with a better price and its much better gas mileage br br
