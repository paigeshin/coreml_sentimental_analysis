 The last business trip  I drove to San Francisco  I went to Hertz Rentals and got a 1999 Ford Taurus  thinking it looked comfortable and professional  I found the seating to be uncomfortable for myself  as well as for my passenger Now  seating comfort may not be important to you  but it is to me The fuel usage was fine  the car did get us there with no problems  but  it was such an uncomfortable ride for both of us  It is not as though I am hard to fit into a car  I am 5 5  weigh 115 pounds  and I am usually quite comfortable in most any car  But  the Taurus seemed especially uncomfortable  For anyone who is thinking of renting a car for a long trip  I would suggest that the Ford Taurus  1999  not be on the list of  be sure to get this There was a large trunk that allowed us to pack a lot of materials needed for the business end of the trip  Driving it was a breeze  and everything  worked  right  I have no complaints about the standard making of the car  except in the comfort area  How important is comfort to you  On a long trip  being an uncomfortable driver is distracting to me  and it made the trip seem unnecessarily longer than it should have felt  I make this trip a lot  The Saturn would have been a better choice for me  as I have rented this model quite often  It offers comforts that the Taurus simply does not have If you are planning a long trip  or to buy a car that you intend to be comfortably seated in  check out the Taurus on a longer trial basis than you might another car  You may find the same thing happening to your comfort
