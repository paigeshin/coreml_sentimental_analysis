 In early 1998 I purchased a 1997 Ford Taurus SHO program car from my local dealer  The car had been purchased and used by Ford as a  quot Junior Executive quot  automobile  whatever that means  The vehicle itself was in great shape with only 15K miles on it  so my wife and I figured  quot Hey  it s practically new quot  The car was back into the shop within the first two weeks to have the  quot Football quot  replaced  The tape deck unit was not functioning properly  so the entire radio climate control unit had to be replaced  Within a month  the car had 16K miles on it at this point  I had to take it back to the dealer to have the drivers side rear window motor replaced  It seemed a bit early to have this motor replaced  but it was under warranty so I didn t complain too much  Things seemed to go fine for about three weeks  when the CD changer wouldn t register that there were any CDs and wouldn t release the CD cartridge  This problem took about 7 visits  3 different CD units and the course of six months to finally get straighten  In the mean time  while visiting family in Iowa at Christmas time  I accidentally pressed the sunroof  quot Tilt quot  button while looking for the map light  in the dark of course  The sunroof then refused to close  It took about 25 minutes of me standing in 4 inches of snow  and my wife trying from the inside to get the sunroof closed   to this day  the sunroof still doesn t close everytime you press the close button  Upon our return  we once again took the car to the dealer for warranty repairs  A few months passed with no further problems from the car  everything seemed to work properly  One afternoon while leaving on another trip to Charlotte  about 3 hours I took the car through one of these gas station car washes  when the sunroof leaked water on my wife  Upon further inspection  we found that  while being closed flush on the drivers side  the passenger side of the sunroof failed to close the entire way  leaving about an 1 8 quot  gap  I stopped by the dealer  set up an appointment and we proceeded on our way  When we arrived in Charlotte  We checked into our hotel and decided to grab a bite to eat before the concert  We drove maybe fifteen minutes from the hotel to a cafe  We spent about another 15 20 minutes eating  When I got back out to the car after eating  it was dead  Nothing  Nada  When I turned the ignition key  abosolutely nothing happened  The car didn t sound like it had a low battery  it didn t make any sound  I had to wait for about and hour and a quater for a tow truck to come  then had to wait another hour while the local dealer supplied me with a rental car  it was a Ford operated rental agency too  I was further informed that FORD expected me to cover the costs of the rental  and that my car might not be ready the next day  since it was 5pm and that I would be charged to take the rental out of state  and then they expected me to return to Charlotte to retreive my car  I was floored at the apathy of Ford  especially when my service records showed the unacceptable number of time that the vehicle had been in the shop for warranty repairs  over 12 times in 12 months  I bit my tongue and rented a car  Crown Vic  60 a day  Luckily my car was ready the next morning  prognosis  the battery had gone dead  I don t see how  when it happened out of the blue  I had had NO problems starting the car at the hotel  and then 45 minutes later  15 of the driving and recharging the battery  and nothing pulling power fromt he battery when the car was turned off  the battery is all of the sudden dead  with no charge  It was at this point that I starting telephoning Ford Customer Service  who most of the time were rude and told me they had no further interest in me or my vehicle problems  After 9 phone calls and 6 months of complaining  a call to a lawyer  and hassling with the local dealer  who all they wanted to do was trade in this car and sell me another one  Ford finally gave me a 75K mile warranty on my car  It took long enough for Ford to show any signs of customer service  I was very diasappointed in the way that Ford handled the situation  I expect that cars have some problems  but it seemd to me that 12 times for warranty repair in 12 months on a car with less that 30K miles was a bit unacceptable  So far  knock on wood  the car hasn t been in for anything other than routine maitenance  oil  brakes  etc in about 10 months or so  Maybe the problems have worked themselves out  I cannot recommend the SHO version of this car to anyone who doesn t have the time or patience to deal with a car that is constantly in the shop br br
