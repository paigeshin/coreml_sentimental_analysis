 I own a Ford Ranger  It is a love hate relationship  This truck has never failed to start  On the other hand  I have had myriad mechanical difficulties with it  Small things  like wires  fuses  and that damn check engine light that comes on at 50 000 miles even if theres nothing wrong  Also  it gets pretty awful gas mileage  But it wasn t overly expensive  for a truck  and it s great being able to haul any kind of stuff  Overall  I would say that I do not regret buying and owning it  but it has provided me with a few headaches  Just remember if you get one  that if your check engine light comes on at 50 000 miles  you may not need to pay for pricy repairs br br
