 My wife and I recently acquired a used 1996 Ford Contour  We were looking for something else but the car dealer convinced us this was  quot the car for us quot  This car has given us nothing but trouble  It has been recalled twice  The speakers are the current problem  The right speakers will periodically stop working  In addition to that the bass has never been really good but I do like to have a system that can at least vibrate the car a little  The bass levels at their highest setting will give most rap songs a little beat but not a boost or a bang  We have also had problems with the air conditioner and the brakes within less than a year from when we bought it  It also does not get good gas mileage  We have to refill at least once a week  We are looking for a way to affordably get rid of it  In all fairness  I may be a little bias because I use to own an 86 Ford Escort and it gave me a large amount of problems and cost me too much money  After the Escort I have developed a negative opinion towards and Ford compact car but this Contour is proving my opinion right  I was hoping that I was wrong about how bad Ford cars are but the Ford Contour that we bought has proven me more right than ever before  Positive comments  Well it does have excellent pick up or  quot get up and go quot  That may attribute to the bad gas mileage  This car is great for those guys who like to race little old ladies at the red light  It will most definitely beat most small cars  buses  and semi trucks  My opinion of this car and most Ford cars is that they are prone to failure  Don t sneeze near it or kick the tires or else it could fall apart  Maybe Ford s just don t like me
