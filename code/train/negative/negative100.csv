 I bought this vehicle from a friend in 1999  he made me an offer I couldn t refuse  The car is beautiful  sporty and ahead of its time  Overall  the Probe is a great looking car  The body is very stylish today  even though it was made in 93  it s an eye catcher  There have been no major problems with rust  I love all of the options  ex  power sunroof  power seats  spoiler  alarm  ect  The Probe GT has a lot of power with it s V6 engine  It also handles well in the snow and rain  The front seats are very comfortable and adjust to accommodate your liking  However  the back seats have virtually no legroom and are not designed for the comfort of backseat passengers  The ride is a little stiff and bumpy but generally speaking  it s enjoyable  Unfortunately  I have had a lot of repairs made in the short time I have owned it  All mechanics I have been to say that it is a tough car to work on  Not to mention  every little piece of the 93 GT is expensive to replace  In the 8 months I have owned the car I have had replaced or fixed  All 4 tires  350 Throttle sensor 200 all spark plugs 100 Tune up 200 Muffler system front to back 450  I also had the transmission worked on several times  The mechanics couldn t find the problem until the third time I brought it in to them  Finally  they had taken it to the local Ford dealer and diagnosed it with a short in the transmission as well as being burnt up  The whole system was replaced  Luckily  it was still under warranty from the person who owned it before me  He had paid  1 000 only a few months prior  One problem I have now is that the Rpm s are very jumpy I think this may have something to do with the computer  as 93  GT s are known to have problems with this  I have no washer reservoir for the front windshield because it had cracked  I was told by Ford that the reservoir alone would cost  200  I had the entire sound system replaced  the stock CD player broke only a few weeks after I bought the car and the speakers were already in need of replacement  The problem with this is that the EQ only works with the stock CD player  I had called Ford about replacing the old one with a new stock radio and the cost was  500  In turn  I replaced it with an after market stereo  which disabled my equalizer  but my new system is fantastic  I have a few squeaks and rattles that I probably should have checked out  but with the cost of everything on this car I m afraid to find out  Once I regain some money  I will probably sell my 93 GT   I have a few suggestions for anyone thinking of buying a 1993 Ford Probe GT  Take into consideration the mileage  if it s high don t buy  Find out how many people have owned the car  Don t forget that it s a sports car it may have been be abused  Understand that you most likely will have problems with this car and be prepared to dish out a lot of money  I would look into a different year and or model  Another member of my family owns a first generation Probe 1989  and hasn t had too many problems  even with 160 000K  They are fairly reasonable to fix too
