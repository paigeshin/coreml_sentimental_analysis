 We purchased the 2000 Ford Explorer 4WD XLT Sport Utility Vehicle  SUV  back in August of 99  We previously owned a Mustang GT  and a Camaro z28   Yeah  Huge change  The reason we chose this SUV is because we were able to get the dealer to come off the price  and we needed an SUV or  Family Car  before the birth of my second child  Since our purchase we are extremely disappointed and unhappy with our Explorer  Don t get me wrong we enjoy the spacious seating  and all the options  But  the all around product is very low quality for the big bucks you pay Engine options for our model included 4 0 liter 160 hp V6  Which feels like very little power when starting out  For highway driving it handles okay  but has a lot of wobble feeling on the inside and you hear a lot of road noise  Our car is Wedge wood Blue with light gray interior  The body is extremely durable  We have had a very minor  3mph  fender bender and it done no damage to our rear bumper  but pealed off the paint and dented the other cars front bumper  The interior is really easy to maintain  We have two toddlers and you could imagine our fears with having the light interior  but I am proud to say that there has not been one spot that we couldn t get out  After about 3 months of owning this SUV we started having a weird problem with the windshield wipers  For some unknown reason while driving down the road the windshield wiper would suddenly turn on by itself and swipe the window about 3 times and then stop  We had one incident were they would not work at all  very scary  We of course took them in to get fixed along with another strange mechanical defect  the check engine soon light would always stay on  They fixed the windshield wiper motor  and said that a sensor went out causing the engine light to stay on  so they fixed that  Shortly after this day  we received a recall on the wipers During the next summer of owning this SUV we had a few incidents were the SUV wouldn t go in reverse with out putting it in drive first   Not good when in tight places  0P  The only happened a few times  and we called the dealer about it but said that they couldn t duplicate the problem unless it happened while they were looking at it  Well needless to say we never took it in because it stopped  But  it still bothers us Our latest problem with this really loud high pitched whining sound that comes from the under side  but only happen while driving under 20 MPH  and when its cold  Well  we took it into the shop  yesterday to be exact  and the darn thing wasn t doing it so they did nothing for us  But  What do you know it started doing it again that same night GRRRRR I know that all cars are not 100  perfect  and that these problems are minor  But the latest deaths  and Tire recall  as well as the big fears of the SUV rollovers   The one SUV that seems to be involved in most of the rollovers  is the Ford Explorer  These recent facts have brought my husband and I to the decision of trading in our Explorer for 4door car  If anyone asks me in the future what I think of the Ford Explorer I would say exactly what I have here  I would most definitely NOT recommend it to anyone br br
