 I will begin by saying that I am not the kind of person who cares what a car looks like  I used to be  when my Probe was new  I d wash her  wax her  etc  Now I have gotten more concerned with other things   too concerned to worry about how a car looks  It has to be dependable  My car is  It s hit poles  just a tap  deer  walls  just a scrape  and guardrails  scrape again  It s rather small  but it still resists crumpling well  After the last deer hit  in fact  I didn t even get her fixed  Still drives fine Interior   Small  Can barely fit four people in the passenger compartment However  the hatchback fits surprisingly large amounts of boxes or furniture Exterior   Sporty looks  Gas mileage   OK   about 24 mpg highway  Only 17 or so local  though Electrical system   has been known as a trouble spot with this car Tires   wear fast   hard to keep aligned  That could be the horrid Pittsburgh roads  though  Lots of potholes Summary   I would buy it again  but I would haggle to pay a lot less than  15000  I would not buy it used  however  because I think it s important to know the history of a car like this  If it were a reliable car  like a Honda  I say buying used was ok
