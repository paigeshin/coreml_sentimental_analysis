 My dad had always wanted a van  He had owned an LTD ford wagon  a white one with blue interior  It was the best vehicle we had ever had to this day  He decided to try ford again  He purchased a 1995 model  white paint and white interior It was a good vehicle for the first few thousand miles  Mind you as soon as the warranty expired  the transmission failed  It cost us over a thousand dollars to get it replaced  and to our disdain we find that the transmission was built with a plastic gear  Who in their right mind would place a plastic gear in a transmission Well  a few months later the head gasket broke  White smoke billowed out of the exhaust and the car overheated like mad  I did everything i could do to get it home  It cost us  1500 dollars to replace the head gasket  It ran fine for a few days  but a mysterious knocking and loss in power suddenly appeared  Antifreeze from the head gasket had worked its way down to the crankshaft and corroded the bearings  and because of this we had to replace to whole engine  With our horrible luck a week later we got a letter in the mail recalling our model van for the head gasket  And then  my father had to fight ford to pay us anything  Initially they offered to pay us for the head gasket itself  which was only  200  Then  he managed them to pay for the labor  the  1500  but refused to pay for the engine which had failed due to their faulty gasket  We lost  2500 because of Ford s incompetence The car ran fine for an other year until the warrantees on the engine and the transmission expired  Then  just our luck  the transmission failed again  I was driving one day and the car started jerking  Then it rode ok after i put some transmission fluid in it  but it wouldn t change out of second gear  We had it overhauled and they couldn t believe the condition of the transmission  They thought it was the original transmission and thought the van had to at least have had over 100 000 miles  but their jaws dropped when we told them the transmission was less than a year old A few days after that  the engine started overheating  It would overheat momentarily and then suddenly it would go back to normal  In the end it was the head gasket  again  This time they said  2500  My dad said forget it  We traded it in for a Pontiac Grand Am after that  which is a great car  We love it  Someone bought our van  by the way  For  2000  Didn t even get it off the lot  the engine locked up on them Ford called our house shortly after we bought our new car  They said it was time for our 85 000 mile checkup on our van  My dad just shook his head and hung up on them br br
