 I bought my 1998 V6 Ford Mustang brand new at the end of 1998  Despite poor salesmanship the car seemed a good looker  had reasonable pace and I had every reason to believe in Ford reliability so I bought it  At around  17 000 I believed and still do I got a bargain First and foremost with 40 000 miles completed this car has never given me any maintenance headaches  touch wood  In this respect it has filled my paramount expectation  Of course the first Mustang question is V6 or the GT  Well coming from Europe 3 8L seemed like a huge engine and the extra cash for the GT a little unnecessary  Three years later and 40 000 on the clock I regret my decision to plump for the V6  Its not that 3 8L V6 lacks pace it just does not compete at that sports car level I imagine 4 6L makes all the difference in performance The interior has been forgiving of my carelessness  with a little maintenance the upholstery and dash are in almost perfect shape  Seats are not luxurious but none the less comfortable  The front seat is electronically controlled while the passanger seat is a lever Outside  this car is a looker bought in 1998 I still get complements on its sleek silver exterior  Get the spoiler However I have become concerned about how my Mustang handles in the rain  coming out of the car wash and on one occasion the Texas snow  The car has a tendency to fish tail especially when building up from a complete stop  I think the reviewed 1999 25th anniversary models compactness may take on board this concern  That salesman told me a lie about them changing the design Overall  this is a solid reliable car  I have maintained it well and therefore expect it to run at least another 40 000 miles  I very rarely have more than two people in my car but on the occasion I do it s less than comfortable in the back  neither does the Mustang bless us with a lot of trunk space  Bottom line   this is no family car
