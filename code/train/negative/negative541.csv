 I bought this car new in 1997 to replace my Nissan 240SX  I was looking for a vehicle that was both sporty  yet very roomy and capable enough to handle the winter s snow and ice  The ability to be a cargo hauler was required  The initial test drive  as well as the first 3 months were wonderful  The vehicle met all of my requirements  not to mention that I felt it was a great looking vehicle The problems started around month three  lasted for four years  and ended just two weeks ago when I sold that car  The minor stuff first  a major annoyance was the tight access to the rear seat  At first I thought I could live with it  but it soon became very annoying  That is really nothing to fault the explorer for  because 2 door vs  4 door is really a personal opinion  But some things are just downright ridiculous  In the four years I owned that car  I had the throttle body replaced six times  intake manifold gaskets replaced  various recalls   too numerous to list  and had multiple transmission and 4x4 problems  Just before selling the car  my explorer started to make a loud  clunking  noise as the transmission dropped out of gear every time I stopped at a stop sign  Equally amusing was the way it refused to go in reverse unless I first shifted into  Park  and waited 3 or more seconds  On top of all that  the body was starting to rust in four different places The dealer serviced this car every 3000 miles by the book  No matter what preventative measures I took   this car would break down  After 4 years I just learned to accept it  So 3 weeks after I made the last payment  I sold that car On the plus side  the front seats are relatively comfortable  The interior remained fairly squeek free  though in year three  the car developed a rattle coming from just behind the driver s side door  Also  the power and torque that the engine develops is very impressive I can not recommend this car  It is a service nightmare  If for some reason you feel the need to take the plunge into this Ford nightmare  spend as much as you can on an extended warranty  you will need it
