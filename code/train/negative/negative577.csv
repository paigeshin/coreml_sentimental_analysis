 After ten years I gave into my teenage cravings for a Mustang  The adult in me limited myself to the V6  stupid adult  The V6 with the sport package looks fabulous  and in spite of being one of the most common cars on the roads  gets complements from some  those who can t tell it s not a GT I m sure  Unfortunately that s all the good that can be said for it It is very cramped  Anyone over 6 feet tall  or who carries more than one passenger  or who travels and needs to carry a lot of stuff should just pass on this car  The trunk  like the back seat  is almost to small to be useful  Much of the interior is not very well though out  For example  you can only put a drink in one of the two cupholders  as one interferes with the stick shift  I can t believe they let it go like that Performance is uninspiring  Granted it is the V6  but my 94 Probe  4 cylinder  was much more fun to drive  They need a new category for the Mustang V6  It s not a compact  and it s not a sports car    It s too big on the outside to be call a compact I m sure  It s worth noting that the car looks much bigger from the outside  than it feels on the inside  Kind of like Dr  Who s Tartus in reverse I wil admit that the car is a pretty good bargain  and I picked mine up as a year end clearout  so I don t feel cheated  But this is my last Mustang br br
