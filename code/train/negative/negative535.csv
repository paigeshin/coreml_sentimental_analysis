 Momma said that if you can t say anything nice  don t say anything at all  Sorry  Ford  but I can t follow that adage when talking about my Explorer  God rest his soul I bought my 1990 Explorer  XLT  2wd  used right after I graduated high school in 1997  With about 120k miles  I ran it up to 175k albeit  a high number  but not outside normal boundaries within 2 and a half years  And  might I add  not without signifigant problems  Within those 30 months I replaced the transmission  2000  two air conditioner compressors  500  and it needed a third toward the end  the radiator  100 patch  that didn t work  and the replacement was a Chirstmas present  along with numerous minor repairs that only added to my frustration  electrical problems  faulty starters  leaky oil gauges that ruined some pants  etc  When it was running  I really enjoyed my Explorer  The gas milage wasn t terrible for such a big SUV  but still not too economical  which was only compounded with my other truck related expenses  I felt safe driving it  not too topheavy but quite sturdy due to its broad wheelbase  and had lots of fun piling up dozens of friends at a time for roadtrips  While the good outnumbers the bad  it doesn t really outweigh the bad  Friends with Jimmys or Blazers never had the ammount of problems I did  I wouldn t reccoment an Explorer to a friend  or even a despised enemy  It just didn t measure up to the expectations given to me by the SUV craze  I m musch happier with my Honda Accord br br
