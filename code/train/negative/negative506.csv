 I bought my 1995 Ford Probe SE because of the sporty look  the price  and the great things I d heard about Ford cars  My one and only mistake was thinking a car seat would fit in the back WRONG  Well  not totally wrong it WILL fit  but not comfortably  I ve had great luck with my Probe so far  and I DO love it  It s gone over 15 000 miles with no problems  It s only been in the shop 4 times  and only for oil changes and new tires  It gets great gas mileage  which IS good for a family  but like I said there s just not enough room  My Probe has more than adequate power  rides great and is great to look at too   This would be a great car for a single guy or girl  but if a family car is what your looking for pass this one by  The seats aren t the easiest thing to clean   hard to get in the grooves  should Junior spill some ice cream  or drop his lollipop  And with such a sharp look  who wants ice cream and lollipop all over the seats anyway  Though reasonably priced  mine was around  3500  used  you can get a much better deal on a more  quot family quot  type vehicle
