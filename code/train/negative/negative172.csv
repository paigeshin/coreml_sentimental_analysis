 I have owned a 91 Ford Taurus since 1995  In that time  I have sunk nearly  5000 worth of repairs into it  including a transmission replacement  numerous brake jobs  and uncounted miscellaneous electrical and alignment based repairs  In its favor  it still runs after 146 000 miles  The air conditioning still works  However  nearly everything else does not  I bought the vehicle expecting reliability  good performance  and decent looks for the price  The looks are mostly intact  although the paint is scaling and flaking in spots  particularly on the top of the vehicle  I never got the reliability and performance has been decidedly spotty  The Taurus provides good acceleration  when the transmission is working  and reasonably good steering  although it doesn t corner very tightly  It does have a reasonably roomy interior  although we ve experienced major fading and cracking of the hard components such as the dash  The major problem with the vehicle  Anything that can fall part  frequently and expensively does  Currently  the gas gauge doesn t work  and whenever the weather is cold  the speedometer doesn t either  Consumer Reports lists the 91 Ford Taurus as a car to avoid  and I must agree  Buy the vehicle only if you can do your own repairs and don t mind lots of grease monkey time  if you don t know your way around a Chilton manual  forget this car
