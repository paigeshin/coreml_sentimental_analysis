 We recently had the chance to drive 2 of these trucks through Budget Rentals  We decided to rent the trucks because of the deal they were having  One of them had 3600 miles on it and the other one had 3200  I think having driven two that I can compare really helps my insight into them Both of these were the 4 cylinder Automatic Transmition with the Hard top bed cover  Both were the extended cab I liked the amount of room in the cab when there are just 2 people and the adjustable shoulder straps were a great asset  The seats were very uncomfortable for such a long trip  My husband ended up having to sit on a pillow on the way back With the hard top bed cover  it made it almost impossible to carry much or to carry anything very large  I ran into problems with it twice  Once I left the item to home and the second time I loaded what I could and went home and borrowed my mother s truck  a couple of years older and a 6 cylinder  to haul the rest of the things The truck drove very well on the flat lands  but when we got up in the mountains it had a hard time handling the inclines  We often lost power in it  Also  it would often kick out of overdrive by itself  My mother says that hers does not do that  but it could be a feature on this model The air conditioner worked great and I loved the cd player that it had in it  I would have to say that the part that I liked best was the cute little buttons that came on the keychain so that you could lock the doors remotely  That was fun  Great for scaring people because if you push it twice  the horn blows  The horn can also blow if you are inside the building and press the horn button  My son tried THAT one out All in all  I would discourage anyone that wanted to carry alot of things in it  ie use it as a truck  or if you lived in the mountains
