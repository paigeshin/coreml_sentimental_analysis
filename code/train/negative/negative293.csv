 I rented a vehicle for vacation last week and unfortunately they didn t have much of a selection  so I ended up with a new Ford Windstar  My first impression was  quot what a piece of junk quot  The fit and finish is absolutely horrible  the quality of the materials makes this van basically like a large economy car  Maybe the  30 000  version comes with better material  The stereo was decent  but its radio reception on a scale of 1 to 10 was a negative 40  There s no antenna in sight anywhere  so I m guessing it s just a wire hidden under the windshield or something Believe it or not  my opinion changed when I first drove it  It s a real blast to drive  it has pretty good acceleration and braking  although the unrefined drivetrain feels too much like my large E150 full size van  Since it s built on a car platform  it rides nicely  very low to the ground  and it doesn t feel like you re going to tip over like in most other vans  Fun to drive or not  the materials still kept their cheap quality  and although the steering wheel was kind of nice  when I reversed out of a driveway and tried to shift it into drive  the position of the steering wheel never let me view the dashboard to see what gear I was going into The seats were pretty comfortable  especially for this type of vehicle  The power driver s seat is the best  the passenger s is okay  and the 2 bench seats in the back only hold a total of 4 very small children comfortably  Family van  I guess  but definitely not a van to hold more than two adults Overall  it s an okay van  good for those on a budget  and who don t mind admitting it by buying one of these  The styling is kind of nice  although it s apparent that Ford took a Chevy Venture and added some NewEdge  think Cougar  details  If you re observant  you can easily tell how much the owner paid for each Windstar by the regular or elaborate front grille  The driver side sliding door is 99  useless  and it s even hard to get in by the one on the other side because a large and very annoying seat belt makes rear passengers feel caged in  The only other thing I have to say about it is  Why is this van so radically popular when it is A  Pretty shoddy  and B  A total spinoff of GM s vans  br br
