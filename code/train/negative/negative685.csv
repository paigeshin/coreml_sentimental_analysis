 my ford focus had some of the same problems as volvinator  quot this car sucks quot  namely the leak and the brake problem  i ve had it in for the brakes twice and now they tell me that because of the high metal content in the brake pads the squeaking is unavoidable  i ve called customer no care and they have been unhelpful even with the best of intentions  i too am facing the 12 000 mile deadline  and one simply incompetent customer service agent even suggested that i just not drive the car so that i don t break the 12k barrier and all my repairs would be covered when the brake pad is developed  when will that be  next week  next month  or next year  she couldn t answer that question  at the mailbox this evening i met another focus owner who has the cruise control problem where if you put it into cruise the car gets a mind of its own and starts speeding away  she also is having the brake problem  and since she has power locks she has one door that refuses to lock when she presses the button from the driver s seat  the only outstanding aspect of this car is the gas mileage  especially while gas is so expensive  an update on 11 16 2000 i brought my car in to fix the leak into the passenger side through the glove box one month ago  they took my car for a total of 11 days without offering me a rental  and when i asked  they said they don t do anything like that  i found out subsequent to this that ford service is REQUIRED to provide a substitute car upon request  although i haven t tried it since then  so i can t vouch that they ll actually do it  well  it is now november 16  and today  for the first time in a long time  we got a nice steady downpour all day  i did not use my car at all today  and tonight  as i am a mere 8 hours away from my 10 day thanksgiving vacation 1 000 miles away  i notice a large  steadily growing puddle on the passenger side floor  the leak is back  and with my trip tomorrow  i have no options but to drive it to new jersey and see if northern ford dealers are more accommodating than southerners  again  just one more reason that i am disappointed with my decision to purchase this car  stay tuned for more details when i try to bring it in again br br
