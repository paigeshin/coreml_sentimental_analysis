 I recently sold my 1 1 2 year old 1998 5 Ford Contour SVT  What am I buying instead  A 2000 BMW 323Ci  This commentary will explain my recent and difficult decision  First  let me praise Ford s Special Vehicle Team for creating an extremely fun to drive and practical sports sedan  Performance in the SVT is impressive based on a relatively small V 6  The engine is one of the top 5 most efficient engines in the world  measured by HP divided by Liter  Low end torque is not exceptional  similar to other competing cars in the same class  Mid range torque is adequate  but high end torque is outright amazing  All of the fun and acceleration in this car is over 4 000 RPM s all the way to about 6 500 RPM s  It is not hard to chirp the tires shifting into second gear Handling is also superb  nothing like a Contour SE  Turn ins are sharp with almost no understeer  I always enjoyed highway entrance ramps in the SVT  by the time I reach the merge lane I could easily be going 80  MPH  One thing the SVT is known for is its sweet exhaust note  At idle it is a low rumble  almost resembling a V 8  During acceleration  the exhaust really comes to life  If you are behind an SVT you WILL hear it accelerate  As for the interior  it is basic and functional  The dash layout is not cluttered or overdone  i e  Pontiac  Unfortunately  it is very basic and almost seems to be missing something  This is a result of Ford s  quot decontenting quot  on the interior since the inception of the Contour in 1995 As for the reason I sold the SVT for a BMW  Two reasons overall quality and refinement  My SVT was in for small  pesky repairs on 3 occasions in the 18 months I owned it  It started with a squeaky clutch pedal  which is certainly annoying in rush hour traffic  Next  the paint on the sill panel below the driver s side door was beginning to peel  This is unacceptable based on paint technology in today s cars  Embarassing too  Lastly  the airbag indicator light began to blink intermittently  Upon further examination  the entire computer system was faulty and needed to be replaced  I sold the car with 28 000 miles on it before the warranty expired and these pesky repairs started coming out of my pocket As for the BMW  it may be more expensive than the SVT Contour  approx   6 000 with similar options  but it is a reliable  refined sport sedan  It has a better ride  is quicker  equal handling  and I no longer have to deal with Ford dealerships Overall  I would only recommend the SVT if you can live with pesky problems and have a well established relationship with the service manager of your local Ford dealership
