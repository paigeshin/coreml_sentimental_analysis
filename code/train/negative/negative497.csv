 It is a 92  got it used about a year after it came out so it was basically as close to factory condition as you r going to get without actually being there  so let me talk about ours  the cigerette lighter in the back doesnt work is our only major problem  but we don t need that anyway  So we ve been in several accidents with it  some in which would be classified as  quot totaled quot  to the cost  even though it wasn t all that bad anyway  so we got them all fixed  and it still runs pretty good  sometimes the heat doesn t work but besides that there little or no problems br br
