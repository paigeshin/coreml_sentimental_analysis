 I drove a Ford Explorer for three years and I liked it until I realized what I was missing  Because it was my first car I had nothing to compare it to  but after having driven other cars I realize that the Explorer is not that great  Its suspension and handling are really awful compared to other cars in its class and it cost me a ridiculous amount of money for gas and all too frequent repairs  I was comfortable inside it but that was probably because I shelled out about  8 000 above the starting price for extras  Although SUVs are traditionally intended more for off roading and that type of thing I assume most people buying one right now would be interested in driving it everyday as I did  which is not something I recommend br br
