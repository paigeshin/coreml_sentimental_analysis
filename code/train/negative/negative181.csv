 No  I m not a princess But a few years ago  my parents decided to buy me a new car  Since they were trading in my Escort  they wanted to stick with a Ford product and I was ready to go for something a little bigger  with 4 doors A few days later  my brother appeared with a nifty new green 93 Tempo GL  4 doors  with almost all the bells and whistles  It was mine and then I discovered the fit  Even though the Tempo is bigger than the Escort there s less interior room  I felt stuffed like a sausage  Still  it was new  it was a gift  and gosh it had AC and power locks and an airbag I ve had it 7 years now it s strictly a train and back car so I ve only got 44K miles on it  In other words  it s likely to last forever  and it meets my needs  However  as a big person  this is absolutely the most uncomfortable car in the world  It requires amazing contortions to get in and out  and the wheel is right in my chest when I drive  I m only 5 5 quot  and even with the seat back  my legs overshoot the pedals Who did they design this for As for reliability  it s had its share of woes  The sparks went at 30K  So did the tires  It s had its share of buzzes and whirs  all requiring  400 600 treatments from my handy neighborhood mechanic  I put a new exhaust system on it at 35K  The battery has never really taken to winter If I could do it again  I d have taken another Escort  No offense  Mom and Dad  I can t wait to trade up br br
