  Author s note   this is not a review of the ZX2  it s a review of the 4 door SE  for which there is no category even though there are 2 categories for the ZX2  Be forewarned There s not a single thing wrong with driving a small car   in fact  it s generally my opinion that there  is  something wrong with driving BIG cars  This is especially true for condo dwelling attorneys and accountants who insist on driving diesel powered duallys and SUVs the size of school buses  On the rare occasions that ms scmrak lets me have it  I drive a Toyota Tacoma  otherwise it s a Honda Accord  So when the rental agency couldn t give me a  standard  car for my two week rental  I went ahead and took the Ford Escort they  did  have  Reluctantly  though  and not because it s fire engine red  Reluctantly because I ve driven these things before Now at the end of my two week rental  with 1000 plus miles of driving the car  I m ready to take the little red sewing machine back to the rental people with my compliments  Why  It s not that it s small  although it  is  rather cozy if there s anyone else in the car  it s that nobody should ever have designed a car with an engine this small married to an  automatic transmission  There s nothing particularly  wrong  with that little four banger  it gets around 27 MPG on the highway  come to think of it though  I ve driven 8 cylinder cars that get upwards of 24  Likewise  there s nothing particularly wrong with the Escort design   it s neither attractive nor unattractive  just sort of a blah little car  In fact it makes a pretty good car for running errands around town  it scoots into parking places neatly  turns on a dime  and has a fairly roomy trunk for your purchases As a highway car  though  it s a dog  even worse than its grandparent  the Pinto  The marriage of a low torque  underpowered four cylinder engine to an automatic transmission geared for economy has created a puppy that can t outrun its own shadow  Sure  it s got lots of low end power for pickup away from a stop light  but try to accelerate from 65 to 70 on a highway  and you ll have plenty of time to pick out a new china pattern and get your teeth cleaned while you wait  I could only hope that a five speed manual transmission would be an improvement over the three speed automatic b The accelerator pedal  For better or for worse  the Escort s built on Ford s oval concept  like the redesigned Taurus and the Contour  That oval motif abounds  including dashboard  instrument panel  mirrors  and trim elements  The design makes for a clean shape and clear sight lines from the cockpit  The cabin is relatively comfortable  although cramped  and the trunk affords plenty of storage room  The engine runs smoothly and efficiently  with good mileage  in the 27 30 range for my two weeks and 1087 miles of mixed highway and city driving  The vehicle handles nimbly at low speeds  the steering is responsive  Overall  the construction is on par with or exceeds similar American made cars  and approaches the quality of Japanese economy imports  In point of fact  the Escort is an excellent example of the timeworn maxim   you get what you pay for  Ford doesn t squander much of its budget on amenities  which is a good idea for an economy car  Unfortunately  they don t squander much on engine power  either b The brake pedal  Ford s fascination with that oval design motif extends too far in at least one case  the side view mirrors afford a dangerously small field of vision  particularly at the outer edges  The interior has plenty of headroom  but the door openings are short   sometimes painfully so  as passengers are prone to bumping heads while entering and exiting  The standard four cylinder engine is underpowered at high speeds  and noisy at any speed  At idle  it sounds suspiciously like a sewing machine  at full throttle  the noise can drown out the radio  My sample  which now has slightly below 11 000 miles under its fanbelt  has developed a few rattles and squeaks plus a tendency to buzz at certain engine speeds  The air conditioning unit struggled to cool the car in direct sunlight  even though Houston topped out at 75 degrees F while I was driving the Escort   Where the rubber meets the road  Overall the car is   as mentioned above   a good example of getting what you pay for  If you have enough cash for a tricked out Escort  though  I d strongly suggest getting yourself a similarly priced version of an import   it will hold its value longer and very likely be less prone to problems involving design and workmanship  If you can drive a manual transmission  it would be a better option for this vehicle  the combination of a puny power plant with an automatic transmission is unsettling at highway speeds
