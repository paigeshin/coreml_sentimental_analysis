 Things have simply gone too far I have long supported the SUV craze  No I do not desire one myself but I believe in life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  If an individual so desires one of these lumbering Goliath s known as THE FORD EXPIDITION  Who am I to question their decision  I am but a humble boy who drives a fuel efficient Civic I must now take a stand  I must now declare that I was wrong in my support for I have only egged on the boggling dimensions of the SUV engineering philosophy  I must now rise up and denounce all the soccer moms and all the weekend warriors  I must rip apart my misguided goodwill and throw it to the side  Things have simply gone too far This morning  driving to work  I  well  I er   How to put this delicately  I saw a midget driving a Ford Expedition This Fellini esque circumstance freaked my world if you know what I m saying I am six four  Tall by some standards  average size by these bean stalk kids I see sacking my groceries in the stores  Despite my lanky stature I have always driven small  compact  decent minded cars  It has not been a decision of preference but rather one of economy  Why would I want a monster to guzzle up all my hard earned dollars on gas when I can blow them on beer  video games  and CD s I have long been content to tour around town in a minuscule ill endowed boy vehicle  I have justified the Suburbans lumbering along beside my trusty old Civic with its dead head sticker happily advertising my social demeanor from the rear window  as cars of practicality for some  You see I have no children  I do not coach a soccer team  and my bikes can easily be hung on a trunk mount for my one weekend warrior exercise I called my Dad  The not so proud owner of a Jeep SUV  and informed him of the horror I witnessed this morning  I heard him say   Hey Cathy  My son just saw a midget driving an Expedition  to another worker in his office  Then I heard laughter This was no laughing manner You see these misinformed people knew not of the psychological scars I had borne this frail morning  I was sitting in wall to wall traffic listening to my favorite morning talk show  I was laughing along with the jokes and feeling a bit peckish from not eating the night before when all of the sudden I felt the Earth move  The sudden quake of the soil beneath me meant only one thing  There was an SUV approaching I looked up to see the driver of the vehicle  I love kids so I was expecting to see a weary mother driving her three kids to day care  It s always a pleasure to see a group of rambunctious kids horse playing in the back of an SUV or mini van  With a smile upon my face I girded my expectations for such a sight  Then the Expedition drove up and inside sat one solitary  little person Do not read me wrong  I have nothing against dwarfs or midgets  I have received much contention on this site in the past for my review of Austin Powers II  I called Mini me a midget and I received hate mail from a person of little stature saying that he was in fact a dwarf  Not to argue semantics but I have always heard people with the unfortunate condition called midgets so I m sorry if I offend anyone out there I was more disturbed by the sheer ludicraceness of the whole event  Here was a person that needed a fourth of the amount of room as myself driving a car that was four times as big as my own  Did they have children  did they coach soccer or baseball  why did they buy this mistake of a vehicle  I was boggled beyond simple mundane ordinary confusion  I felt the juice I had ingested earlier that morning swelling up in my stomach and my ulcer began to throb The Ford Expedition gets twelve count em twelve miles to the gallon  My former boss owned a Suburban and he said it cost him fifty bucks to fill up his tank  How much would it cost to fill up one of these My wife and I rented an SUV for our honeymoon  A Rodeo  It was a small SUV  As we drove across Death Valley I would say to my wife   Here s a gas station we d better fill up She would look at me in confusion and say   Why we just filled up thirty miles ago  Then in understanding she would pause a moment  look down at the dash realizing the monstrosity of the vehicle encasing her and say  Oh yeah  we ll stop here I have to pee anyway When shopping for an SUV please do not consider size  When the Ford Expedition came out it was test marketed in the Dallas area  The news crews were interviewing people about it  I remember clearly one lone man stating  when asked if he would buy the boat   Yes  I like it  It s big For those of you who feel the need to drive around in a monster  raise the wheels on your truck  take the muffler out of your Pinto so that at least it sound big  Please do not purchase a Ford Expedition  They are unsafe  scary to little cars  and impractical  Buy a semi instead  I m at least used to those I do not think a midget wearing a suit and driving an eighteen wheeler would cause me such mental distress br br
