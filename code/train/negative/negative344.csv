 Expedition into vanity  selfishness  and irresponsibility I realize that this may not be the forum for such a discussion  but I know some people about to buy an SUV will read this  and I am curious about what they think  Are SUV s a guilty pleasure  or a bit irresponsible  These days in America  capitalism and consumerism are the twin gods that no one dares blaspheme  and the auto market is perhaps the arena where these gods exert the most influence  We love dogs  dogs love trucks  we love trucks  I understand that for many many people  an SUV is a sensible purchase  However  going off road is becoming more and more rare as there becomes more and more road and therefore less and less off road  From what I have seen  the bumpiest road that a majority of SUV s see is a gravel driveway  But why do I care  live and let live  right Not really  First of all  because SUV s are bigger and bigger  it becomes less and less safe to own a small car  I mean  a Ford Expedition could run over one of those Ford Festivas and not even know it  This is an alarming trend  The first Jeeps managed to be hardy without being Hummers  but others don t seem to think this is possible  Secondly  and I am no eco terrorist here  but the gas mileage thing does seem a bit short sighted  Thirdly  the sheer tonage of an Expedition does a lot more damage to city and suburban roads than a smaller car would In conclusion  it seems to me that a lot of the reason many people buy SUV s is simply vanity  Cars once had vanity plates and now are becoming big packages of vanity themselves  I realize that often the American dream is measured in terms of how many cars fit in your garage  Living in a city  and near decent public transportation  I have managed to live without a car for my whole life  However  I can t help it  I lust after them daily  But as much as I mull it over  even if I had the money for it  an SUV just seems a bit wrong  And yet now everyone makes an SUV because the market for them is just that big  Isn t it great that we have all this money  Isn t it lovely that our country is at peace and has been for years Isn t it fantastic that we can write  talk and exchange opinions with people all over the globe Isn t it about time we started caring for someone besides ourselves Please feel free to correct me  but it seems that SUV s are a symptom of a larger problem  I don t mean to condemn anyone  I am just curious about the real causes behind this disturbing trend br br
