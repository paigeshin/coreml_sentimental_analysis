 I have owned two different Ford cars in my life and am not impressed with either one  The first one was a 1987 Ford Escort bought new  It broke down on the freeway less than a month after purchasing it  needed a new engine head and was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts from Detroit  That was only the beginning of problems with that car  needless to say 10 years later  I am persuaded to give Fords another chance  My husband and I bought a 1995 Ford Contour GL  4 door sedan  It seemed pretty nice at the time  with about 30 000 miles on it  We have it only a couple of weeks when the cup holder breaks  Now this may not seem like a big deal but they are made of  very  flimsy plastic  and I accidentally set my purse on it which totally snapped it off  The cost to replace it  How about  68  The cupholder is still broken to this day Next the fan switch stops working  Well  it works  but only on the lowest speed  If you turn it up  it turns off completely  Visualize us desperate for some a c with our faces pressed close to the dash vents The rear doors start making this horrible screeching noise when they re opened  WD 40 has no effect Then the engine light starts coming on and off randomly  We take it to several different places  nothing is found to be wrong  The latest is that the transmission sounds like it s starting to slip  I dread the thought of a  1500 tranny repair cost  All I want to do is unload this car  but unfortunately Fords do not hold their values that well  and we probably could barely sell it for what we owe on the loan I will never buy another Ford again  I know some people swear by them  but I have owned many Honda  Toyotas  and Nissans that served me much better and I think I ll go back to what I can depend on br br
