 The new Ford Focus came highly recommended to me when I was looking to buy my first new car  I researched its history and found that it received great reviews for comfort and safety during its European release  Test driving the car  I found it to be comfortable  well equipped and stylish  I have now driven the car for for 6 months and have put only 5000 miles on it  While I have been happy with the overall performance of the car  I have been sorely disappointed with the workmanship involved  Realizing that  new models  are notorious for having  manufacturing bugs  I felt somewhat reassured that these would have been worked out from 1998 1999 during the first European release  I was wrong  My car has been in the repair shop a total of five times for manufacturer s defects including a flooded passenger compartment  repaired twice to date  faulty master clutch cylinder  misaligned striker plate on seat back latch  broken break switch and cruise control  While I really love my car  I would hesitate to recommend it to any but my worst enemies  Time will tell if the problems my Focus has had are unique or are related to intrinsic design flaws br br
