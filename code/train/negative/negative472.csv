 Alright  so you re interested in buying a sport utility vehicle  Time to look around  The Ford Explorer   a great car  Size is not too big and not too small  Huge trunk size  Design is flawless  especially the 1996 model  Now  four door or two door  The difference in price is certainly one factor  but  let us look at the other factors My qualms about the two door The back seat passangers have very little room It s really no bigger than a regular car and gets ten times worse gas millege Basically  two door cars are just a big pain to deal with  from my standpoint Pay the extra cash for the four door  It s easier  nicer and just  overall  more convenient It makes driving enjoyable when everyone riding in the car is comfortable and happy If you are shopping around for sport utilities  also consider the Toyota 4Runner  my personal pick  the Niessan Pathfinder and  for a smaller variety  the Honda CRV  which  in actuality  is not small by any means   I test drove one a few months ago and was extremely impressed with not only the size  but also all of the special features that come even on some of the most stripped down models Happy shopping and drive safely br br
