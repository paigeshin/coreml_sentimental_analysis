 We bought this vehicle 6 months ago after the birth of my second child and felt the need for a little more room  I have to admit I bought the car because it looks good  The exterior is beautiful in my opinion and the color choices are many  The downfall is the interior  I m not a leather seat person and the SEL only comes with leather seats  not heated  The dashboard has your typical  quot american car quot  look about it  The rear seat fold down very easily I must say  The ride is smooth but loud as most Fords are  But it serves it s purpose for our family  Room for all and lots of trunk space  I just don t feel we had to spend  30 000 for that
