 We bought a new Explorer in 1995 and felt we got a pretty good deal after beating on a couple of fleet sales managers  Some of the reasons we purchased the Limited are  we liked the leather option for the seats  the privacy glass for all but the driver and passenger windows   I really liked  the interior door lock by the back interior door  the ability to lower the back seats and move the front seats all the way forward to accommodate my 6 3  frame if I wanted to sleep inside the vehicle  it was not as tall as most all of the other SUV s so it would fit in our not so tall garage  the shift on the fly four wheel drive option  and the classic lines that didn t look like a GM product  Now mind you I have had a couple of other Ford products and had the same problem with at least 2 of them  THE TRANSMISSION We never thought that there would be the same problem with the Explorer  but at 8K miles guess what  After coming to a full stop the transmission locked up and it wasn t going to go anywhere  Fortunately the warranty covered the replacement and we were off to see the sights of Oregon  Since then the only problem we have encountered has been the automatic shock adjustment for different types of roads  They have not evenly leveled the vehicle and it is plain to see when you stand behind and look at it  It doesn t seem to affect the ride but we don t know what would be an obvious sign that it needed repaired other than just looking at it  One other real down side to the vehicle is the ride  On long trips the lumbar support just isn t there and driving can become painful br br
