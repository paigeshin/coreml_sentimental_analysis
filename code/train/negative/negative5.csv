 The Ford Winstar is a car that I would not recommend purchasing  I have driven this van several times and I can t get used to it  The handling is horrible do to it s swaying feeling  It actually feels like the car is going to tip over in some turns  The side passenger window creates a blind spot  which I think is dangerous  Where the side window meets the windshield is where I think the problem is  When braking it also feels like the driver doesn t have control do to the car having a difficult time stopping quick  This car doesn t stop efficiently  it doesn t handle well and it also doesn t provide the driver with a very good frame of vision on the passenger side  I feel that this is a safety hazard not only to the driver and their passengers but also to everyone else on the road  Not recommended by me br br
