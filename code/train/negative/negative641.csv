 My dad bought this car used  He paid  15 000 for it  It was used  and had just over 28 000 miles on it  So the price was right  He needed a low mileage vehiclee because he s a salesman and piles on the miles incredibly in this thing  After about 10 months of use  he s already put over 55 000 miles on it  It s been okay so far  but I m hoping he ll replace it really soon and getting something much better like a Buick Regal or something  I almost have him convinced on that car The Taurus is my dad s car  It is equipped with the 3 0L Vulcan engine  and there s not too much good I can say about that  First  the car is very underpowered  It doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures  Also  under hard acceleration  the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly  quot refined quot  V 6  Also  the axle ratio on this car is extremely low  at around 3 90 1  This means it revs really high and not that high of a speed  Also  in overdrive  it hits about 2300 2400 rpm while cruising at 65mph  Our van only does about 1900 2000 at this speed  Also mechanically  I m not to impressed with the transmission on this car  When you accelerate real lazy  it shifts smooth out of first  When you give it about half throttle  it shifts pretty rough  But then  when you floor it  it shifts smooth again  Figure that one out  Also  when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed  it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on  Lastly  the design of this model year Taurus is pretty bad  It s way too  quot bubble shaped quot  as my girlfriend says  The circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision  and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors  Admittedly  the Taurus has an excellent ride quality  With the upgraded suspension  it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car  The seats are comfortable and well supportive  and the controls  though some looking quite tacky  are in easy reach and easy to use  The gauges are goodsized and understandable  and the overall roominess is great  Previous to this car  my dad had a 1994 Taurus  Compared to that  this new Taurus is much above  However  a guy I know owns a 1997 Pontiac Bonneville  and I would take that 10 to 1 over this car  That is one slick car  Not only is it extremely quick  it is quite  and incredibly smooth  I personally wouldn t really recommend this car to anyone except older folks who don t drive too much  This definately isn t the greatest car Ford has ever built  It somewhat lacks in the quality department  Kind of ironic considering their slogan  quot Quality is Job 1 quot  It s an okay car  but it s not on the top of my list
