 I bought this car thinking it would be a deal  because my friend owns one  and he said it has been great for him  well little did I know how absolutely terrible this car is  it breaks down every 20 miles  gets bad gas mileage  and it has this odor It s awful  I can t turn on the heater  because the element has broken down  the radio hardly works  I can only listen to KOZY 106 5  which is fine  but it gets really annoying  the steering wheel sticks  I have had to call my friends and family so many times to come pick me up from work so many times it s embarrassing  And noone will buy it off of me because unlike me  they are smart and can spy a lemon  I have even left the keys in the car in plain view in high hopes that someone would steal it  but they wouldn t even do that for me  This is seriously the worst car I have EVER had
