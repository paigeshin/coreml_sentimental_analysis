 In January of 1999 I bought a brand new 1999 Ford Ranger Extended Cab with the  quot Sport quot  package  The total cost of the vehicle was around  18 000  This meant that it did not have CD  auto locks  auto windows  etc  It was is just a  quot bare bones quot  truck  It did  however  come with a free 24 hour roadside service package and a  1 000 rebate The first thing that I noticed about this vehicle is that it isn t designed for people of slightly above average height  Being 6 2 quot  my field of view is very limited  and the vehicle is sort of cramped  But  it was all that I could afford Almost immediately  my truck began to malfunction  I took it to a nearby dealer for an inspection  Since I didn t buy the truck from their dealership  they didn t act as if they cared to help me with my problem  And  when I finally did get them to look at it  they said that nothing was wrong with it My main concern was  quot power surges quot  that caused my lights  radio  etc  to go on and off in a sort of  quot flicker quot  fashion  After 3 tries of trying to get is looked at  I was told that nothing was wrong this coming from the Ford mechanics Shortly after that  me and my father were almost killed due to their mis diagnosis  The power system totally shut down while I was on a dangerous strip of highly trafficed road  Barely able to coast off the road  I was sure that we were going to die Thanks to the roadside service  I was able to take the truck to the dealership  They then admitted that there was a glitch and replaced the broken part with a used part  quot remanufactured quot  is the term they used When I complained about them replacing the part with a used one  they stated that it was Ford policy to replace electrical parts with used ones  And  I was told that Ford no longer makes that electrical part so the only parts on the market are used When I inquired as to whether my NEW truck had come with used parts  I was put aside  My question was never answered  Neither was a direct inquiry to Ford ever answered Now  my multi functional switch is broken  So  every time that I try to make a turn my wipers come on  But  since it takes 45 minutes to 2 hours to even talk to a customer service rep from Ford I have yet to get it fixed Trust me  my next truck WILL NOT be a Ford  Ford Tough give me a break br br
