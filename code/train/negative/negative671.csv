 I rented myself a Ford Focus in St  Louis for a three day weekend trip for a wedding in May  So I don t own this car  but did drive it quite a bit during that weekend  This is a largely plastic feeling car  Its interior was very plastic y and felt like I was trapped in a plastic box  Its power was very unimpressive  making a labored sound on acceleration  It did handle quite well  likely in large part due to its somewhat compact size  The seating was somewhat cramped for me  a problem I often get even though I am only a shade over six feet tall  The car seat didn t go far enough back as I would have liked  The trunk was surprisingly large and there were lots of small compartments inside the car for stowing drinks  maps  etc  I liked that part a lot  The mileage was great  thanks to the car s small size and powerless engine  I am used to a 4 year old Acura Integra with about 75 000 miles  which gets good mileage but still has a lot more pep and life than this almost brand new Focus  I went into the car with an open mind  hoping that maybe this could be a car that I would consider buying  I don t list it as a maybe anymore
