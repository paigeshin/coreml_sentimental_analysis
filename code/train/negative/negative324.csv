 I was shopping for a new vehicle and wanted something bigger  I thought I wanted a mini van  it had to have room for kids and dogs and lots of  stuff  I did a few some quick polling of people and realized that no matter what brand they were either loved or hated I went to a local dealer and found a 1999 Ford Windstar LX  It was a nice van with only 46000 miles on it  Luckily I went on a Saturday afternoon and an agreement was reached where I would drive it over Sunday  Easter  and come back to finalize the deal on Monday On the test drive with the dealer it did fine except for the door sensors dinging whenever we hit a big bump  I was told that was common and would be cleaned and fixed  I really enjoyed the comfort of the drivers chair  it was truly like being in my living room chair and the ergonomics of the controls were great My girlfriend loved the ride as well and was sold on that aspect of the van  However  as we began our drive for Easter dinner  the mechanical nature of the van began to show  First  the sensors for the doors that had just beeped and flashed when we hit hard bumps began beeping and flashing for almost any bump or curve  That is very aggravating and distracting  More worrisome at highway speeds the steering was awful and very  mushy  for lack of a better word  You could turn the wheel almost a quarter of a turn with no response and then the van would lurch the direction you were turning  Every now and then the transmission would slip just a little  The brakes gave once or twice as we were sitting at a stop light Luckily I had not paid for the thing yet and was able to return it  I did a lot more reading that night and found out all of these problems were rather common in a Windstar  I took the beast back to the dealer on Monday morning and drove home in an older Nissan Pathfinder with more miles  It may not be as comfortable but I have no doubt I can be driving it in ten years with well over a hunred thousand miles on it If you are thinking about a Windstar beware
