 I bought this vehicle used in 1997  It had only 42 000 miles on it  a modest amount for Los Angeles  and looked to be in great shape  The previous owner certainly kept up the aesthetic quality of the car  So I test drove the car and after doing a little research decided to buy it Well the problems started soon after that  The first major repair was when there was short in the electrical components of the car s overdrive  It would cause the car s RPMs to ramp up in spurts  So I took it in and they had a hard time even finding the problem and then fixing it  several days in the shop and several hundred dollars later I got it back Then I was driving home from work one day and a spark plug popped out of the engine block  I know it sound implausible but it happened  that required new wires  The exhaust pipe broke at a seam in the middle  that had to be soldered  It was leaking tranny fluid from the pan  All sorts of things that add up to a few hundred dollars And then the biggie  a complete valve job and replacement of the O2 sensor  It was leaking oil into the area of the spark plugs  I found out that this is a COMMON problem of these  93 Probes  That was  1400 and six days in the shop And then there are the minor things  like the inner door panel on the driver side coming off  The power window switch falling off  the power attenae being power less  The window fluid sprayer is basically not working  There are a few noticeable rattles  So this car  at least for me has been nothing but a headache as well as a financial drain  When it is operating  it is fun car to drive  I love the look of it  and it certainly has some spunk with it s V6  although I wish it accelerated a bit better  There is ample room in the trunk  but equally  quot un quot ample room in the rear seats for passengers  The driver side seat doesn t really go back as far as I would like  I would suspect for someone taller then me  5  10 quot  it would be a problem  But the seats themselves are quite comfortable  It corners on a manhole cover  i e  very wide  But it drives very comfortably  especially if you like a fairly stiff ride I bought the car because I liked how it drove and looked  My understanding is that the  93 and  94 models have a lot of problems  93 was the first year of their redesign  which may explain a lot of the problems  If you like the look and you like it when you test drive then if my experience is indicitive  then perhaps you need to look at a  95 or later br br
