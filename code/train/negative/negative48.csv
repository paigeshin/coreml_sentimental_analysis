 This car would make a great pic nic table  or maybe a great fountain in the front yard if you gutted it out  This car would be absolutely great  just as long as you weren t driving it  I absolutely hate my Ford Tempo  It was a great car for the first day  and I still think the interior is rather comfortable not roomy by any means  but comfortable  This is a very minimalist car no special features  pretty basic interior  pretty sluggish  etc etc etc  It s only great feature is that it s a cheap car to fix  And fix you will do a lot  This car makes more noises than a synthesizer  unfortunately they don t sound as good  Watch out for the harmonic balancer  This happened to me after the first month  Basically it makes a sound like a jackhammer in the distance  especially when making a turn  Apparently this problem is so common  that when I took it to the shop  the mechanic ran upto my car before I left it and told me I needed to replace my harmonic balancer  Apparently Ford stuck a very cheap one in the tempo that cracks on a regular basis  Ok  back to the car buy a Taurus instead  In fact  if you can  don t buy a Ford  So  to reflect on what I ve just written  this is a bad car  a very very bad car  Don t buy one  you wont be happy  unless you are a really twisted person br br
