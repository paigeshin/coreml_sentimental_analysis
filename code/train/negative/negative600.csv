 What you are about to read is what I got from a weekend rental of the 2003 Ford Escape  I was kinda excited when I found out I would be able to drive one of these for a whole weekend in my search for an SUV  Our local Ford Dealer had no problem letting me take the vehicle for the whole weekend  He was sure I would be back on Monday to make a purchase Well once I first got in the vehicle I did feel alot of comfort  After checking out my surroundings I did notice that the head room was incredible  but how much do you really need  The seats are comfortable  but pretty boring  they were just a plain tan color just average  After a couple minutes  I really felt as it I was in a Dodge Caravan of the late 80 s  It just has the feel of a mini van  I was very disappointed with the center console  it is nothing more than a huge pit  There is nothing there to really hold any Cd s  spare change  whatever it may be  It was basically a 2nd glove box  Nothing spectacular Once I started the car up I could tell the power  upon trying to put the vehicle in drive I notice that the gear selector is on the column  Didn t we phase this out yet  very outdated  Once I left the lot  I noticed right away that the engine had power  but was pretty loud  The vehicle has excellent pick up The Escape I borrowed had very few options  basically a stripped model with floor mats  and mud guards  The options it did have like power windows  power door locks  etc  were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle  and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver  Radio had some definite volume  but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise Once I finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp  I was ready to take the car back to the dealer  The engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle  I found myself talking much loader than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger  Very disappointing with the road noise  but speed and handling were very nice To keep this short  I had the vehicle all weekend  and hardly drove it at all once I got home  It is pretty basic  and a little boring  The V 6 Engine had more than enough power  but they need to build something around it SUMMARY It is definitely one of the lower priced 4X4 vehicles  but there are other options out there  I would suggest looking to other makes and models  As the salesman told me  All the fathers are buying these for their daughters  So maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing  Good luck in your SUV searches
