 We searched for and decided on this truck after the little Isuzu we had conked out  We bought this truck with 13000 miles on it  This is my husbands truck which I don t like to drive but have to sometimes  What is there about the truck that I don t like  I will try to be fair The truck is just a plain pickup truck nothing fancy  It is an XLT 2 door regular cab  and has a 4 cylinder engine and automatic transmission b Features   Automatic Steering  The steering handles well and responds to the touch Antilock Brakes  They work  Air Conditioning Cools off quickly  Heat takes a little longer to kick in  Power Windows  This has a neat feature that I wish my van had  When the ignition is switched off the button that operates the power windows can be used if the door hasn t been opened  I always end up having to put the key back in my van and switching it on to operate the windows Stereo with cassette and CD player Shutoff switch for airbag on passenger side  Can only switch on or off with the key  This is a great safety feature if you have a small child riding in the passenger seat or a toddler car seat There is a third window in the truck that is in the back windshield  This window slides back and forth like a sliding glass door b Comfort   The Seat Belts are adjustable for comfort The Seat has a lumbar support that helps ease the strain riding or driving There is not much leg room between the dash board and the seat  The seat slides back and forth and is adjustable  There is only room for two people in this truck  there is a third seat belt but it would have to be a small child to ride comfortably The instrument panel is convenient and easy to reach for the driver and passenger b What I like  I like the way the steering responds  I like the safety switch for the airbag b  What I don t like  I do not like the way it handles on a wet road  The truck is light and feels as if it slides when it is raining  If there is a strong wind the truck sways  The power of this truck is okay to drive on the freeway without getting run over  The Ranger drives okay in regular traffic and driving on regular roads  Going up a hill or steep bridge it feels like it is straining to keep up speed  Times like this is when I wish I had a straight shift  The bed of the truck is big enough to hold a good size load we have used it to move a daughters furniture  It drives more stable to me when it has a load  I would not use this truck to pull a boat and trailer There has been a problem with the light that tells you a door is open  It comes on when all the doors are closed and locked  I think my husband finally got it fixed The noise level of this truck is high to me  My husband says it is normal but it still sounds awfully noisy I would not buy another one  For driving back and forth to work and hauling groceries it is fine  I would not take a trip in it to the mountains
