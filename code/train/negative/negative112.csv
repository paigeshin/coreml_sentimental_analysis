 My mother owns a  94 Ford Contour Special Edition four door sedan  There have been Six  SIX  Manufacturer s recalls on various parts of the vehicle  She was only notified of this AFTER the recalled item had effectively ruined another part of the automobile   ex  The wiper blades malfunctioned and gouged her winshield  She takes impeccable care of it  yet things are constantly falling apart  The shop fixes one thing  and another goes wrong  Sure  all cars have their weak points  but it is ridiculous  Definately not a car for someone who doesn t know how to do home repairs Other than that it s a good little car  It has fast pick up  excellent braking  and the gas mileage is nothing short of miraculous for it s size  I m almost sorry to put it down  but consumers deserve the truth br br
