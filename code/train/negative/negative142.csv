 I bought my Ford Windstar for a few reasons 1  I have two active teenagers and a grandson  I wanted a vehicle that could also double as taxi for all of their friends 2  I love to travel by car and I thought that this vehicle would save me hotel motel fees 3  I love Lyndsey Wagner  LOL First let me tell you  I have the 98 version of the Windstar  I hate this van It s less comfortable than riding a Greyhound bus cross country  it eats gas like you wouldn t believe   15 city and 35 highway  I ve taken it into the shop many times  and the dealer always claims that the problem is fixed only to have many more    problems  I ve replaced the brakes more times than I can count  and the Windstar drinks up more oil than a sailor on leave Forget windy conditions  the Windstar bobs around like a ship lost at sea Last but not least  the seats do not lay down to make a bed  they fold  So there s no way to camp out in the Wind Star The ford Windstar reminds me of a nicely made bed with no sheets on it In other words  it looks pretty on the outside  but there is nothing under all that pretty lace br br
