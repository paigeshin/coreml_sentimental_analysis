 I bought a new Ford Ranger  four door  last day of June this year  actually it was a lease purchase type of deal  Red Carpet  I paid  2 600 cash down and I had a four hundred dollar discount coupon  making my total down  3 000  I noticed right away that it road walked  and didn t handle well on curves  I had traded in a little Nissan and it handled like a dream on curves  with this Ranger I had to go slower than the curve sign amount of miles suggested  Also every little bump in the road  the rear end would like bounce off to the right or left  road walk  and at high speeds it would feel like I was about to loose control sometimes and startle me  I convinced myself at first that it was just the difference between a big truck and a little one  then I decided I would take it in on my next days off and get it checked  since it was a fifty mile drive  I never got the chance on the way home from work one morning  I had a right rear blow out and rolled the pick up after only having it two weeks  Then the air bag came out about the size of a basket ball and burst  there I was lying on the driver s side and this nasty smoke coming out of the air bag about to choke me to death  I turned off the ignition because the smoke alarmed me and I thought the thing was on fire  To make a long story short after being given the run around by rude people at the Ford motor company  and my insurance would not cover all the amount owed on the truck I drove an old car of my mom s for 2 and 1 2 months  and still no replacement  I will never consider another Ford vehicle of any type again br br
