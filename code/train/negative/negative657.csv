 Through a bizarre series of family events  I attained my 1990 Ford Mustang 5 0 LX hatchback for free  I had just got my license a week ago  so I was thrilled to receive such a legendary car as my first car  and completely for free  I mean  you re a 17 year old male  how could you say no to 225 horsepower  300 ft lbs of torque  a V8 engine with a few modifications here and there  The owner before me was quite the drag racing enthusiast  so the mods included  stabilizer bars  dual Flowmaster exhaust  and ram air intake  The only thing I didn t like at the time was that it was automatic transmission  But no worries  it was free  and I saved my mother at least  4 000 Ya know  maybe I had a lemon  I know how to take care of cars  I never raced it  and I treat my property with the utmost respect  But within the second week  there was a major transmission problem  it wouldn t go over 45 mph  I guess it wouldn t change into the next gear  all it did was rev high  My entire transmission had to be rebuilt  totaling about  1 750  My mother and I said to ourselves   Okay  this is just one problem  We ll get it fixed  then that ll be it Next thing I know  I m stuck in traffic on Highway 4 and smoke is coming out from under my hood  I call up a friend who knows more about cars than I  and he suggests it s an old thermostat that should be replaced  So over a weekend  he and I replace the thermostat with relatively no trouble  besides a few bruised and cut fingers  After that  the car ran like a chime  For about a week  Just today  in fact  I was stuck in traffic  My temperature gauge read normal  but there was smoke coming from underneath the car this time  It seems that there are too many problems for me to justify keeping the car  oil leak  improper alignment  squeaky brakes  wobbly power windows  the overheating  insurance  attention from cops  etc  Most of the things I ve mentioned can be fixed  but the thing is that after I fix it  I know something else will turn up  I guess it just comes with the territory of a muscle car There are things I like about the car  Its loud and growly exhaust never gets tiring  It s fast and powerful  With 300 ft lbs of torque  you can dust your everyday ricer and make them feel stupid for putting on those pointless decals  You get plenty of attention when cruising past the theater on a Friday night  With ritualistic washing and detailing  the car looks beautiful  even if it has its share of dings and dents  But I m afraid that the problems I ve had outweigh the things I like about the car If you re into fun driving  I don t suggest this car  It ll give you good quarter mile times  but don t expect to do any canyon carving with this car  I mean  you could  but I know that I m too scared of going into uncontrollable oversteer and driving off of a cliff  Heck  my airbag isn t even functional right now So I m looking into selling the  Stang  It was a decent car while its problems remained hidden  Besides  I m into  fun  driving  Can you say Mazda Miata  Toyota MR2 Turbo  They may not beat a  Stang or Camaro on the strip  but personally  I see the bends more often than a quarter mile strip  And the thrill I get of downshifting and upshifting around a series of corners is much more exciting than getting low 9s at the strip
