 Myself  being a young guy  went to a Car Dealer  Car Happy  and wanted a car  looked around  was limited to an Automatic Transmission  Looking Around  I was surprised to have seen a big white Ford Contour for such a cheap price  I test drove it  big  lots of buttons  Great  huh They Conned me in to buying it  so I bought it  thank God I got the Extended Warantee  The Car was in the shop many times  One day in the morning  I was getting gas  I learned the gas was on the opposite side of the car  ok  I ll reverse it  pull to the other side  IF I COULD ONLY SHIFT IT OUT OF PARK  The Gear shifter was broken  had to tear it off  allright  I got out of there  Later that day  strange  Windows going up slowly  Starter sounded like it wasn t ever gonna start again  was driving  all of a sudden  wouldnt go over 30  and it decided to stall  Got it fixed  fine  besides the foggyness of the front lights which ruined any attractive qualities the car may have had  the Problems with Turning  axle  the belts to be replaced  the parking light coming on while I was driving  it was a good car  Looked better at night  great power if you turn the Air Conditioner off  and there is noone but you in the car  cant get that with a Honda  Good first car if you have a warantee and a loner car  The only problem I can t get fixed that I hate would have to be whipping around corners  It feels like the Wheels will fall off when you go 15 around a corner  the tires screeching no matter what the air pressure  It is NOT a Honda  don t confuse it as one  it is Big  Bulky  and sorta slow  Don t try to break a speed record
