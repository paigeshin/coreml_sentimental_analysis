 I bought this car in the summer of 2001  At that point the car was just over 3 years old and had 23 000 miles on it  It was a one owner local trade in  and an internet title search revealed no major accidents  floods  or other problems  I paid US  10 500 As of this writing  2 years later  the car has 60 000 miles on it  I am religious about scheduled maintenance  so the car has been well taken care of  I put a lot of miles on it in the first 15 months I had it  but have since relocated and now only drive it about 10k a year So far I have not had to fix anything really major  but I have been perturbed by a number of small annoyances  First  days after I purchased the car  there was a problem with a sensor governing the cooling system  it made the cooling fan run all the time  so that the car ran too cold on the highway  The dealer fixed this for free under the terms of a 3 month  3000 mile warrantee that came with the car Second  the 6 CD changer never worked right  It won t play a CD in the  1 slot  I complained about this to the dealer when I brought the car back for the problem mentioned above  and he replaced the CD changer unit  But it didn t fix the problem  Either I got two bad units with the same problem  or the problem lay somewhere else  Since I sometimes have more pressing matters than dealing with this stuff  I never went back to the dealer again about the CD unit and live with a 5 CD changer instead Third  like several others in this forum  my Taurus has problems with the door is ajar sensor  It s completely unpredictable  Sometimes it thinks for days that a door is ajar  then suddenly the light goes off and all is well again for a while  I haven t had time to get this fixed yet  so in the meantime I yanked the circuit breaker for the interior lights   Check your owner s manual  it s clearly marked and easy to do Fourth  another strange electrical problem has seemed to go away  inexplicably  on its own  for a while  all of the lighted information on the center console  radio  clock  A C info  etc  would disappear at random intervals  When this happened  I had to turn on the headlights  which turned on the dashboard lights  to work the radio or A C  Very annoying  Even weirder  the problem hasn t recurred in nearly a year The fifth annoyance is that the entire center console between the two front seats seems to have one main function  creaking and squeaking  It drives me nuts  It squeaks and creaks constantly  I ll mention this to the dealer when I take it in for the door ajar problem  but I m not optimistic about them fixing it so it doesn t creak and squeak Sixth  with 60k on the car I m noticing the beginnings of a leaky valve cover gasket  which will need to be replaced  This used to be a job for the do it yourselfer  I did one once on an old Mercury Comet V 8  and I m not all that handy really  but these days the way engines are crammed into tiny engine compartments I woudn t want to try it myself on the Taurus  A leaky valve cover gasket can happen eventually to any car but shouldn t happen at 60k in my opinion And seventh  at 50k miles I had to replace both front brake rotors and both rear brake drums because they were all warped  There was subtle brake pedal vibration at 30k miles and by 50k it wasn t subtle any more  That shouldn t happen  Even before I bought the car  I d heard that the rotors warp easily on these cars  and that has certainly been my experience So  to sum up  I haven t exactly been thrilled with the Taurus  If I m experiencing these problems in the first 60k  what is it going to be like at 120k True  I can afford a lot of small repairs with the  8000 or so I saved by not buying a new Camry or Accord  Thus  for me  the big question is whether the powertrain will hold up over the long haul  If so  the car will still have been a bargain despite its annoyances  If not  I would have been better off buying a new Camry or Accord
