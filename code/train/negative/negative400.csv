 Kinda Like the Girl in Pretty Woman  Good Looking  but pretty darn unrefined Face it  the old Ford Taurus was butt ugly  The front lights looked utterly bug like  and the dashboard was so  revolutionary  it was confusing  The new Taurus remedies some of the problems of the old one  as the dashboard is pretty straghtforward  and the body  while not a knockout  is far better looking than the old one  While the car feels solid  at least the doors  The body panelling just has a thin look to it  maybe from cheaper than average paint  And while the dash is far less cluttered than before  one has to think about the designers who thought that rubber plastic looks good  and the little TV style volume markers on the LCD display  I mean  if it sounds loud enough for you  who cares about the little markers When I first got behind the wheel of the Taurus  the steering wheel struck me as a little odd  its smaller than the average steering wheel  by maybe about two inches in diameter  My hands felt closer together than normal on this steering wheel  and while it did nothing to detract from driving it  it was disconcerting at first  The wheel might have been designed for those with smaller hands in mind  but it works for the bigger handed among us too The car does not seem underpowered  but one would not get that impression by listening to the transmission  which is loud  rough  and shifts very loudly  especially when starting up from a red light  When you floor the gas pedal  the transmission will suddenly shift down to first or second  and it makes the entire front of the car very  very  loud as it reaches and passes the 3000 RPM mark  Fortunately  this only lasts a few seconds  however  regular shifting is also quite loud  At least it doesn t shift very much on highway driving  and it rarely  hunts  on winding  hilly  country roads The front seats are comfy  and the footrest is placed just about right for my length of feet and legs  The rear seats are more cramped than other cars in it s class  and they could be less angled  at least in my opinion  The trunk is not small  however it is a tad shallow The pillars behind the rear seat are kinda wide  so backing up is a slight chore if you have to look to the side  for kids  for example  Also  the brake light hump is incredibly large  and it not only takes up a lot of space in the rear view mirror  but it also covers up a lot of the trunk area  so that it is hard to see the edge f the trunk when you look through the rearview mirror  so it is difficult to judge the length of the rear of the car Another unrefined part of this car would be the brakes  These brakes don t kick in until the pedal is most of the way down  and the brakes gradually get stronger so that they are grabby only at the end of the pedal stroke  and even to just slow the car down  the pedal should be pushed nearly all the way to the bottom of the stroke B The Verdict B This car  while not bad  isn t up to the competition  The Camry is a much smoother driver  as is the Accord  However  if you are a die hard American car owner  than this is probably the car for you  whil it might not match the import competition  this car is in many ways still far better than it s Chevy and Buick competition
