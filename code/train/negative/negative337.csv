 This is the first Epinions review I have done for a car  I usually stick to PC games and the like  and it might seem silly to review such an outdated car anyway  But I m sitting here with nothing better to do and some things to get off my chest about this HEAP that I drove for five years  and where better to do it than Epinions  I got my blue  92 Tempo Sedan when I was 17  It was a hand me down from my father  thanks  Dad  that s the best hand me down you gave me since I genetically inherited your asthma  and was already a few years old  Oh  and let me say this right now  I was working very hard to get good grades in a very difficult prep school and did not have the time to get a job and get something better for myself  okay  Let s just clear up this little question before anybody asks it  Some cars are unreliable enough to be annoying  A Tempo is unreliable enough to be DANGEROUS  Things went wrong with the car almost immediately  The automatic seat belts froze in place  permanently  The power locks failed so many times that my Dad just tore in and made them manual locks  saving ninety dollars every three months for new solanoids  The driver s side power window also quit working  Of course  this made going through the drive through at restaurants  or just rolling it down for some fresh air  quite difficult  The only reason it was still POSSIBLE is that Dad glued a metal handle to the top of the window  allowing me a very low tech way to raise and lower it  The car lurched  lunged  and shook while I drove it  It made grinding noises and occasionally made a sound as if a massive sledgehammer was hitting the hood  The transmission  linkage  and suspension on a Tempo are pure garbage  Cheaply made  and shoddily assembled  The air conditioner broke on at least three occasions  The guy who fixed it on the second time pulled off the button panel to find that the plastic on the other side was melted  and that I was lucky the car had not caught fire  Tempos do that  you know  They catch fire  And they burn  At least the brakes worked  If they hadn t  I might have been killed ten times over by now  I am over six feet tall  and this car was so cramped I could barely squeeze into it  My head touched the ceiling  It was like trying to drive a clown car  The paint came off of the roof in large patches  It didn t chip  but sort of  faded  away to reveal the primer  Luckily  a Tempo can t get any uglier no matter what color s  it is  I never expected much from this car  Just a means of conveyance  and one in which I could have some SEMBLANCE of trust and reliability  I didn t even get that  Hey  at least I had absolutely NOTHING to worry about as far as car thieves were concerned  A thief would have taken one look at my car and kept right on walking  unless he had some giant stack of fifteen foot by twenty foot typing paper that he needed a weight for  When  Old Blue   as I liked to call it sometimes  other things I called it can t be written here as these reviews are censored  finally died  I was 20 and working a summer job between college semesters  The transmission bled out  leaving a trail of fluid in the car s wake  I got in and started her up  but the car wouldn t move  I inherited my Mom s Buick Century  infinitely better car  after she got a new Regal  There was just the question of what to do with the Tempo  I wanted to push it into the Ohio River or maybe take it to a gun range and shoot at it  but my dad decided to have it towed away and repaired  He unloaded it on some chump for five hundred bucks  I still think Dad won on the deal  and I haven t seen it since  So ends the saga of my first and last Ford car  I am man enough to admit that  on occasion  this car terrified me  I feared for my life when driving this car  I did not take it on freeways for fear that it would malfunction at 65 miles an hour and kill me  My father used to say things like   You should be grateful for this car  because you didn t have to work a day of your life to get it  In my day  blah blah blah  Yeah  Dad  WHATEVER  He could have afforded to get me a new Toyota or Honda  but instead insisted on giving me this PIECE OF SH  to  I suppose   Teach me the value of a dollar  or whatever  It was a lesson that could have killed me  I saw that most other guys in the high school parking lot had nicer cars than mine  Not because they had jobs  but because their fathers weren t TIGHTWADS  I felt jealous and underprivileged  I m not much for wrap ups where grades aren t concerned  so  THE END PS  If you are a parent  you owe your kid better than a Ford Tempo for his her first car  Ask yourself if it s better to  teach your kid the value of a buck  while putting his her life in danger  or to get the kid a Honda Civic so he she can LEARN TO DRIVE A DAM  CAR WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO FIX IT EVERY THREE WEEKS  SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH  Okay  I m finally done
