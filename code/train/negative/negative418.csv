 My apologies first off for the rambling course this post is about to take  these are the things I ve encountered in the last 10mos as they occur to me  If you are under  5 8 quot  this truck is way too big for you  I am 5 4 quot  and when I shift gears  my legs rub against the dash  indicating that the truck would likely break my legs in the event of a front end collison  The air bags are nigh on fatal for a person of my size  and the seat has to be so far forward when I drive it  that I look like a hood ornament  If you are independantly wealthy and gas prices don t affect you  Go ahead  This baby s for you  It ll quickly help you lose weight  by first lightening your wallet  spare change jar  and mattress where you store that hidden stash of cash  Kraft dinner for a month after repairs  I researched the cost of a clutch in the event that I needed it   650 cdn for parts alone  I nearly crashed the truck upon reciept of that information I bought the truck because I wanted to have something to haul materials for house renovations  and for a horse trailer in the near future  I learned afterwards that the modifications required to handle a horse trailer greatly exceeded the ins and payment savings of having purchased a 6cyl  The truck has great  quot get up and go quot  but a word of advice  if your performance or milage decrease  don t let them reprogram it  it hasn t run run right since  It s been so expensive to me  both the gas milage and the cost of  quot diagnostics quot  to find out what s wrong with it  that I can t afford to gas it up anymore  nor can I afford to take it in to find out what s wrong with it Following is a copy of the email that I sent to Ford of Canada  To date  this issue has not been resolved  and I am about to trade the truck off on something more economical  and less prone to breakage I m sure there s more  but it s late and I can t remember anything else right now  Storm Why in the world would something as dangerous as the brakeline freezing due to the exhaust pipe being in front of the wheels not be a  quot recall quot  I bought a 97 F 150 about 10 months ago  upon the advice of a friend who had had wonderful things to say about the one that he has  I recently noticed that it was increasingly difficult to get out of my driveway some days  the truck smelled terrible  like something burnt  and my gas mileage was awful  I have been releasing the brake  the light was off  the pedal was up  but the brake apparently was still on  I called the dealership  because I had been told to watch for this problem  and had wanted it fixed  They said that because the truck was no longer on its  quot original warranty quot  that the repair would not be done by Ford  and that to have it done is about  700   This seems a little steep doesn t it  Especially since  a catback system for my other vehicle was only  200 installed  and that was tuned exhaust  And also that they thought that I should bring the truck in so that they can make sure that there s no damage to the wheels or brakes  So now  because of a design flaw on Ford s part  I have endangered my brakes and wheels as well  Why should I potentially be liable for a repair like this  This seems a little bit ridiculous to me  and frankly  with the way that this truck has  nickeled and dimed  me for the last 10 months  power steering pump  oil pan gasket  MAF sensor  computer reprogrammed 2x  a check engine light when I  silly me  decided to wash the engine  back firing  17mi ga combined driving  block heater cord  this was the last straw    I don t even have the money to do this sort of work anymore  It has steadily whittled my bank balance to practically nothing   I have had it in for warranty work 4 times in the space of the first 6months I had it paid a deductible 2 times  as some of the work relied on parts and I was asked to bring it back a second time  was charged for things that WERE on warranty  when I called Ford Customer Care  I was told that it was an issue between myself and the dealership  and that Ford would not intervene  That sounds a lot like the dealerships have been given autonomy  that s quite frightening  and there are numerous things that are not covered by the  quot don t worry  it s all covered on warranty quot  warranty  so sayeth the salesman that I purchased the truck from  as well as the Sales manager  Service manager and several other people of the dealership  coverage that I purchased  I had purchased this truck so that I could park a car that I  thought  was costing me a great deal of money  I had thought that I would have a vehicle that I would have to do only routine maintenance on  and that would be reliable  and not a source of financial drain  Soon I will have a clutch to do  possibly brakes  they say that my exhaust is shot  I think it s safe to say that I couldn t have done all this damage in the amount of time that I ve had the vehicle  I have had to do rear brakes once in my other vehicle  and a clutch once  as I learned to drive a manual on this vehicle  and had a leaky rear main seal  This is in the space of nearly 8 years  And exhaust doesn t corrode that fast  I don t care how many kms you put on it  Based on the last 10 months  I might have to park the truck  and I AM puttng my poor little 83 Firebird back on the road  It gets 22mi gal even though it s shooting gas out of the top of the carborator  If the brakes can freeze on  what stops them from freezing when they are not on  I m told there s a great deal of hydraulic pressure that stops this from being an issue  but the system is only as good as it s weakest part  and when using the  brute force  method to break them free  I would think that something somewhere has got to give  Not to mention what it will likely do to the tires  such as icing them up  This would cause poor braking conditions  wouldn t it  I would rather not find this out by hitting another vehicle or worse yet  a person  I understand that there were safety concerns that were the reason that Ford was making the modifications  do these safety concerns go away once the truck is not on warranty  I should think not  I would think that this would be a recall situation  and not just a bulletin  This situation concerns me a great deal  and if I do not find satisfactory resolution for it  I may have to lodge a complaint with Consumer Reports br br
