 After having my second child  I wanted a family car so I purchased the Ford Taurus  The car ran fine for the first 2 years  after that it has not been the same  The speedometer  odometer and power steering all went out  It was still under warranty so we took it back to the dealership and they fixed the speedometer  odometer and power steering but now 6 months later it is still not running right  It has trouble shifting from first to second gear and the dealership said they could find nothing wrong with it  That is just the way it runs  If that is the way all Ford Tauruses run  then they have a problem  I do like the roominess of the interior and the trunk  The backseat is large enough that with 2 children  they cannot reach each other with is a plus  The trunk is large enough to fit luggage and a stroller in it  If I just lucked into a bad one in the bunch and they are not all like this then this would be a good car for people with children  If they all run like this  then I would not recommend it br br
