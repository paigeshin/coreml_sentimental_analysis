 The Ford Taurus has survived almost 20 consecutive years since its first year in production  that s more than many cars that have come and gone over the last 15 years or so  So why is the Ford Taurus so successful  It certainly has not received the best reliability ratings  the ride is anything but smooth  and despite being relatively cheap in cost  the Taurus has never offered an extraordinary value  On a recent trip from Eureka to San Francisco the  94 Ford Taurus GL sedan provided decent transportation  but not without the typical problems so often associated with the mysteriously popular Ford Taurus  For the  94 model year the Ford Taurus comes in 3 trim lines  2 body styles  along with 4 different engines and 3 optional transmissions  Trim lines body styles include the base GL sedan  tester  and wagon  LX sedan and wagon  and the SHO sedan performance trim line  The base trims come with an OHV 3 0 V6  tester equipped  and an OHV 3 8 V6 both producing 140 horsepower and both coupled with an AXOD 4 speed fully automatic transmission  The SHO trim comes standard with a 3 0 DOHC V6 when equipped with the 5 speed manual or a 3 2 DOHC V6 when equipped with the optional  new for  94  4 speed automatic   Driving Impressions i With only 55 000 miles on the odometer my  94 Ford Taurus GL tester felt like it was on its proverbial last leg  Off the line  acceleration  is adequate with very little wheel spin torque steer  however under full throttle the 3 0 OHV Vulcan engine feels and sounds more like an unrefined 4 cylinder than the V6 that it is  Despite being somewhat slow  it was the transmission behavior that was the killer  Under full or even partial throttle the transmission clunks into gear  letting the driver know each time it up shifts or down shifts  The worst part of this 4 speed automatic transmission is its low speed operation  When driving between 10 20 MPH and punching the throttle  the transmission would many times slip completely out of gear revving the engine towards redline  only to eventually clunk back into gear when letting off the throttle  I m not new to this feeling  I have owned 2 Ford Tauruses and a Mercury Sable in the past to find similar transmission issues  I have also found the 2002 models to carry some of these same transmission characteristics  Like many mid sized family cars in the early mid 1990s the Ford Taurus offers less than exciting  handling   The handling limits on twisty roads are easily reached making the  94 Taurus GL uninvolving and uninspiring in this department  Body lean roll and lack of feel in the steering are the main problems here  The General brand P205 65R 15 all season tires only aggravate the situation  While the Taurus finds its home on the freeway  it s  cruising  abilities still pale in comparison to much of the competition for the  94 model year  The base GL model I drove offered some of the most unrefined highway cruising in a family sedan that had an original MSRP of over  16 000  Engine noise is kept to a minimum  even at 75 MPH  however  wind and roadgrain noise are prevalent throughout the cabin at high and low cruising speeds  The  94 Taurus GL also suffers severely from rattles  and sudden jolts when driving over small imperfections in the road  The  94 Chevy Lumina and 94 Honda Accord both do a much better job keeping their occupants in a hushed environment when cruising on the freeway  back roads  or even through town  Hills climbing is adequate  I could not get the Taurus GL to go up one large hill in top gear  although once the automatic transmission down shifted  again clunking into gear  the car could maintain a decent pace  but not without engine noise  and transmission fuss  If a used Taurus is a must on your car shopping list  and if you live in mountainous areas  the 3 8 liter option is probably the way to go  This particular engine offers much better hill climbing power VS the OHV 3 0 b Braking  was also poor  Having a front wheel disc  rear drum set up without ABS can be more than adequate for many cars  however it made for some scary moments going down steep hills in San Francisco with this particular  94 Ford Taurus  The brake pedal felt extremely spongy  and I found myself many times flooring the brake pedal just to get this car to stop  my Mercury Sable LS had this same problem b Fuel Economy  is good  the EPA rates the  94 Ford Taurus GL 3 0 at 20 29  I observed about 30 MPG overall on my trip from Eureka to San Francisco and back  The fuel tank is 15 gallons so fill ups are kept limited   Interior Accommodation i  The GL model I drove was bare bones  no amenity options  just basic everything  no power door locks  no power mirrors  etc  etc  Dual front air bags came standard and so did an ashtray  Instead of a cassette player that comes standard with most cars in 1994 with a MSRP of  16 000  my tester just came with an AM FM stereo system with 4 speakers  A major gripe with the interior of the  94 Taurus is all the exposed screws in the doors handles and in the plastic moldings around the doors and windows  one does not have to look very hard to find these exposed screws  The plastics also used in the cabin are extremely cheap looking  Cheap plastics and exposed body metal around the window seals also contribute to this  put together with wood and glue  theme  Seating is adequately comfortable  but the cloth bench seats in the front provide no bolstering whatsoever  and the rear bench seats are  full bench  so they do not fold down for added storage like the more accommodating 60 40 split variety Interior room and cargo are by far the  94 Tauruses strongest assets  Unlike the 94 Chevy Lumina there is tons of head and leg room up front and in the rear  The Ford Taurus design provides very good use of the space provided  also allowing for a very large trunk i Exterior Innovation i  When the 2nd generation Taurus was first seen in 1992 it was all the rage  unfortunately by 1994 these cars were getting quite dated looking  In 1996 the futuristic yet ultra odd looking 3rd generation Tauruses arrived making the 2nd generation seem even more dated  While not ugly by any means  I feel the  94 Ford Taurus is more of a practical somewhat handsome grocery getter design than anything sporty or otherwise   Price Reliability i  New  these cars could run close to  28 000 in top of the line SHO trim  My tester had an MSRP of  16 000  today the retail cost is about  4 000  I have seen these base modeled Tauruses go for as little as  2 000 with the owner s claim that they  ran great  Reliability has been very poor according to my own research with the 1st and 2nd generation Ford Tauruses  This particular Taurus has had few major mechanical repairs as of yet  however  hoses  belts  brake rotors  thermostat  struts  front turn signal covers  and power steering lines had to be replaced in 55 000 miles of use  I would also like to note that the car is constantly needing front wheel alignments and I forecast a new transmission is already in demand i Final Thoughts i Like the infamous Hyundai Excel  the Ford Taurus has showed us what it is made of over the years  While it has provided flawless transportation for many owners  it has created severe headaches for just as many  if not more owners  It s not only the reliability issues that has lead me to rate this car at 1 star  it is its overall build quality  ride  and lack of performance  If you are in the market for a used car in the  2 000 4 000 price range  I urge you to test drive as many cars as possible  Some of my personal favorite cars in this class and price range between 1992 1994 would be the Honda Accord  Toyota Camry  and the Nissan Maxima Looking for a slightly better built Ford Taurus  Check out my review on the    a href content 75710631556  2002 Ford Taurus a    Happy Car Shopping
