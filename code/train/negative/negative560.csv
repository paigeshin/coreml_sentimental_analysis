 A few years back  1991 to be exact  my dad purchased a Ford Explorer used  with about 20 000 miles for 10 grand  At the time  it was a good deal  and it turned out to be a smart investment  I enjoy the features it comes with  nice stereo  leather seats are comfy  good for the outdoorsmen  The only really obvious negative qualities is the backseats  and the shocks  The backseats are really uncomfy  despite the leather seats  It doesn t raise up high enough for me  it was uncomfy when I was 5 5  and now that I m 6 feet it is killing me  Also  as someone getting a driver s license soon  I have a permit  I don t enjoy a bumpy ride  I prefer my mom s 94  mercedes 520SE  I think it is the shocks that cause it to be so bumpy  It isn t horrible  but if you hit a pothole it could throw you off the road  Also  on another note  the engine began having some problems after 10 years  We had to get a new one  Overall  good suv with nice features  and a couple of halting problems br br
