 Let me start out by saying that I own a 1994 Ford Escort DX  see my review  that that particular car gets great mileage it s only a 4 cylinder  but considering everything it s been a great car and it s held together very well for all the miles that I have put on it  not to mention the fact that it is a Ford  Fix or Replace Daily  Now on to the 2000 Ford Taurus  I happen to work for local government   I operate this vehicle in the capacity of my job duties  and let me tell you that the 2000 Ford Taurus sucks  First of all it get lousy gas mileage  It has no real power despite being a 6 cylinder car  my little 4 cylinder seems and feels escort has more power and quicker reaction than this vehicle  I mean I have to put the pedal to the floor to get any real reaction out of this car and then reaction is slow and jerky  The brakes are noisy    not because the brakes need to be repaired it s just that the car just makes a lot of noise  The body and the look and the feel of this car is just yucky  It s very noisy  Here s something positive that I can say about this car  it holds the road well  and the seats are sort of comfortable  So I wouldn t say that I would not totally not recommend this car  but I would say buyer beware
