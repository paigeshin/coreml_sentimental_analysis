 My 1996 Probe SE was a gift to me  and the buyer got a great deal on it  at least that s what I thought at first   Appearance  The Probe is a great looking car  Some say it looks like an artificial sports car  but with the sleek styling and flip up headlights  it s got a very sporty look  It even had a small rear spoiler  which added to the sportiness  The shape of the Probe makes its length a little longer than I tend to like  It s difficult to park the car a lot of the time  The strangest thing about the Probe are the windows  There is no frame around the windows  and the doors are sealed with a rubber molding around the door frame  The problem with this is that it makes it noisy  outside wind is easily heard  and easy to break into  All it takes is prying the window slightly and then using a wire hanger to unlock the door  My car was broken into and  cleaned out  much to my dismay The interior looks great  and the seats are similar to the bucket seats you see in many sports cars  The material and workmanship of the interior seems top notch  The rear seats are not roomy  and passengers in the back seat will often bump their heads on the rear window b Features  My Probe SE had some great features  including excellent A C  great pick up and handling  and a decent sound system  It is versatile for a sports car  since it is a hatchback  It allows you to fit a lot of things inside  although the sporty styling means less vertical space for transport   Ride  The car is a front wheel drive  and handles very well in the winter  It accelerates quickly  and handles very responsively  At times the ride can be a little rough  especially when going over bumps and potholes  but overall it handles like a dream  The automatic transmission makes for quick starts  and the shifting has a sporty feel  The RPMs will run high  then quickly shift to give the quickest acceleration  Despite the fast acceleration  it gets great gas mileage  I usually got 30 or more miles per gallon on the highway My chief complaint about the ride is the noise  As mentioned before  the windows are sealed with rubber molding but no frame  This means that wind noise can be heard through the window and rain can easily leak in  Sometimes  in fact  the window would roll down on its own  The engine also rattles and squeaks a lot b Reliability  Here is the Probe s weakest point  reliability  About two days after I got the Probe  the engine stalled while I was in Chicago traffic  It started again  but then after I stopped for gas I couldn t get it started  After having it towed I found out it was a bad connection between the battery and the engine  and cost  30 to fix  Little did I know that repairs were going to be much  much more expensive later on During the two years I owned the car  I had to replace the oxygen sensors twice  700 each time this happened  I had to replace the catalytic converter  800 with installation  and have minor work on the transmission  about  350  After I had given up a few limbs to pay for repairs and had complete preventative maintenance done on it  I figured it would run for a while with no problems  In 4 months the  check engine  light went on for the 3rd time  I was told that the car needed a new catalytic converter  just replaced a year before  new oxygen sensors  just replaced 4 months before  and electrical work  all which would add up to  1800  In the end  I decided to donate the car to charity  and bought myself another car  The gift would have cost me almost as much as the original amount paid  This car is great for people that don t mind frequent repairs  or those who are car enthusiasts who can do their own repair work  It looks cool  and it s so much fun to drive  Even the automatic has power galore
