 When purchasing a new or used vehicle  one always wants to be as knowledgeable as possible about the options available  However  sometimes no amount of research can prepare you for the treachery that lies ahead  when you make an error purchasing a vehicle  The Ford Taurus is a perfect example of this paradox  When researching this particular vehicle  you will find raving reviews from many reviewers  everyone from housewives to the consumer reports The problem is  or it appears that  generally when a person is attesting to  or commenting on the reliability of a car particularly a new car  it is generally before the problems have taken place The Ford Taurus is relatively pleasing to look at  with it s sporty  areo dynamic design  The interior is very comfortable and roomy  The ride is quiet and smooth  and it generally gets very reasonable fuel mileage  Having all these things going for it however  does not alleviate the frustration of the fact that there have been so many recalls on many different areas of the vehicle  transmission  steering stabilizers  air conditioning  electrical system  etc  that it spends more time in the repair facility than it does in a driveway As well  I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the attitude and the lack of concern shown by the Ford Motor Company  when notified of the seemingly chronic problems that arose with the vehicle  Although this vehicle has been rated very highly in the safety tests performed on vehicles in this class  and although it is a pleasing vehicle as far as aesthetics  A consumer would certainly want to take into account the potential lack of reliability  as well as the difficulty in getting the adequate and appropriate service performance from Ford Motor Company that would make this car acceptable to own
