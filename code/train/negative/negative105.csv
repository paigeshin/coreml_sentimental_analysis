105
Neg
 I bought this because I needed 4WD and wanted something popular that I could easily resell  I bought it used at 128k and have put about 60k on it  In the 22 months of ownership  I have spent over  6 500 in repairs and have replaced the A C  the transmission  the 4WD gears and lots of minor stuff  The thing is my repair shop  to whom I am very loyal  explained they see the same repairs over and over on Explorers  This is the 2 A C replacement and the 2nd transmission replacement I put a lot of highway miles on my cars and have had this truck in 4WD for less than 100 miles total  I change the oil and have it serviced like a good boy and they fellow from whom I bought it was a nutcase for servicing  This truck  as popular as it has been  is not engineered to last  I will not buy another one of these
