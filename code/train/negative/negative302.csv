 We were rear ended while in our 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan  which I love to pieces  and had to have it repaired  Needing a mini van  we ended up with a 2000 Ford Windstar  Granted it was the lowest possible model that the rental agency purchases  but this van was terrible  It had the get up and go of a snail  and the blind spots  Boy  if you ever wanted to purchase a vehicle with really bad blind spots  this would have to be the one  You can turn  twist  and do all the maneuvering you want and you still can not see out of those rear windows  The vehicle felt too light for being the size it was  but then I am used to driving a 5500 lb Caravan  It did stop quite smoothly though  You did not have to mash on the brakes and throw everyone to the front of the van  The seats were a bit uncomfortable  and even in the basic model  for being the price they are  seemed to be missing quite a few features that you would expect to see  like something besides a plastic steering wheel  The road noise was also quite terrible  I felt like I was yelling to the passenger so they could hear me  Over all  I would not purchase one these  But please remember that this was a rental vehicle that we only had for a week  I would stick with my Caravan any day br br
