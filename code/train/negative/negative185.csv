 Beginning around fall of 2000 I told people interested in buying a mid sized SUV that they should wait until a totally redesigned Explorer was introduced in January 2001  It ended up being delayed a couple of months  but in March it finally arrived  I promptly took one for a test drive and posted the following review on March 15  At the time there was no 2002 listing  When a 2002 listing appeared I reposted my review to its current location I ve never cared for the Explorer in the past  It was based on a very dated Ranger chassis designed in the early  80s  This showed in how it rode and handled  Like most SUVs  and nearly every American car thirty years ago  the Explorer used a body on frame construction  The Ranger based frame was far too flexible for such a heavy vehicle  Combined with soft body mounts  between the body and frame  used to help the ride  this resulted in a vehicle that shimmied and shuddered over even minor road imperfections  So why did I have high expectations for the new Explorer  The first one was thrown together in a hurry on a tight budget  No one at the time knew SUVs would turn out to be so hot  Now Ford knows  Even more than that  it knows that the Explorer is the best selling of the all  that this makes a huge amount of money for the corporation  and that the Japanese are finally waking up and fielding some top notch SUVs  Put all of this together  and Ford knew that its continued financial success depended on redesigning the Explorer so that it was the best  I d like to maintain the suspense as to whether or not the new Explorer met my expectations  But you ve most likely already seen that I gave it three stars and a  not recommended  so you ve probably already guessed that I was quite disappointed once I had the opportunity to drive one  But if you want to know why I was so disappointed  you ll have to read on   What s new for 2002  Why were my expectations so high for the new Explorer  In an acronym   IRS  No  certainly not the Internal Revenue Service  The other IRS  independent rear suspension  Truck based SUVs like the Explorer generally have a solid  or  live  rear axle  This means that the wheels are rigidly attached to the end of a solid metal tube that contains the heavy differential in the center  When you hit a bump with such a suspension  this entire heavy axle and wheel assembly absorbs the shock without the mediation of any springs or shock absorbers  Because so much mass is set in motion  it has a tendency to jostle the entire vehicle  it s a matter of simple physics  force equals mass times acceleration  To help absorb so much force  the springs and shocks have to be made softer  What s more  the solid beam transmits anything that happens to one wheel to the other wheel  So  all else being equal  a vehicle with a live rear axle usually handles and rides significantly worse than one with an independent suspension on all but perfectly smooth roads   With an independent suspension only the mass of a single wheel tire brake assembly is upset when one wheel hits a bump  So why don t SUVs simply have independent rear suspensions  Well  live axles are better for the sort of serious off road driving few SUV drivers actually do  This is why Jeep uses a live axle in front as well as in back in all of its vehicles  until the new Liberty comes out  Live axles also tend to be more durable when driven over rough terrain  Finally  and this is the most important thing for a company like Ford  they are very cheap and easy to manufacture  Take all of this together  and you might understand why I suddenly had such high expectations for the new Explorer when I learned that Ford was going with an independent rear suspension  Because an IRS is so much more expensive  I took this as a sign that Ford was doing whatever it takes to make the new Explorer have excellent on road ride and handling  This is after all the same company that only recently has made an IRS available on the Mustang  and even then only with the top of the line Cobra  Information that the all new frame would be far stiffer than the old one provided further evidence that this might be Ford s goal  I have now learned that Ford also had other benefits in mind  Namely  they wanted to open up space in the rear for a new feature  an optional third row seat  Going with an IRS made this seat possible  even though the new vehicle is just a tad larger on the outside than the old one  Sure  it is a cramped seat  much like those in the Acura MDX and Dodge Durango  but many people want a third seat for kids  and for them it should do just fine  Going with an IRS also allowed for the amount of cargo room to be substantially increased and for the cargo floor to be significantly lower  Anyone who has had to put a lot of stuff into an SUV will probably realize the significance of that last improvement  Some other improvements are worth mentioning  In the powertrain department  the 210 horse OHC six is largely carried over  while a 240 horse eight is new  The latter replaces the venerable 302  which saw its final duty in the Explorer  The new eight is based on the base engine in the Expedition  but has an aluminum block to save weight  While the old eight was paired with a four speed automatic  the new one is paired with the five speed that only the OHC six came with before  The extra gear is between first and the former second  This should improve acceleration beyond first gear  since RPM will not drop as much after the shift  keeping the engine in its powerband  The eight is a  695 option  Are the extra thirty horsepower necessary enough to be worth this much money  Read on  Styling is not among the major changes  Most people probably won t even notice that the styling has changed  That said  the new design has sharper creases than the old  lending it a more upscale appearance  The Mercury Mountaineer  the Explorer s twin  has more unique styling than in the past  with a front end that people are likely to either love or hate  Personally  I prefer the classic styling of the Ford  I admire what they have tried to do with the Mercury  the trendy brushed metal thing  but don t feel they have quite pulled it off   Accommodations and amenities  With the above knowledge  I took a trip to the Ford dealer  Things started to go wrong as soon as I hopped into the driver s seat  You sit high  Too high  I got in  and the sunvisor was just barely above my line of sight and it was up  And I m not a tall person  only 5 9  Hmmm is the seat all the way up  I hunted for a power seat button  and found a rotary knob that adjusts the lumbar in and out instead  Was there no power seat in this vehicle  I figured there had to be  I was sitting so high  Somehow my hand found it s way between the adjusters for the lumbar support and the recliner and found the control for the power seat way down there somewhere  The seat was up  but only about an inch  Even in the lowest position I was sitting too high relative to the windshield header for my personal taste  The dash is quite low  providing excellent visibility forward  The seat could be lower and still leave the driver well above the top of the dash  Why isn t it  Beats me  Or why didn t they simply extend the windshield higher  the top of the roof is well above the top of the windshield  Again  I haven t a clue  Maybe I m unique in liking the windshield header well outside my line of sight  I don t know  I certainly don t like having it so low  It s like having a baseball cap on all the time  I don t like that either but maybe the market for these trucks does  Somehow I doubt that was the logic involved  Aside from the header issue  front seat comfort is OK  They provide an average level of back support  Nothing to write home about  good or bad  in terms of comfort  They could look nicer  though  The fairly small cushion with a rounded front edge just looks econocar ish  The rear seat raises even more questions than that low header high seat in front  In the new vehicle there s more room back there  enough to fit a very comfortable seat at a very comfortable height  As it is  the height of the cushion is about average  which is to say just a bit too low to adequately support the thighs of someone my height  Few vehicles do have a sufficiently high rear seat cushion  so I can t complain too much about this in the Explorer  I can and will complain a lot about the height of the rear seatback  It s really low  as if it was designed for small children  So low that when the headrests are down all the way they press into the upper part of my back  This is actually more comfortable than you would expect  Felt kinda nice having them there  The problem is that in this position the headrest provides zero whiplash protection  I couldn t raise the headrest because the seat had the plastic on it still and I didn t want to be the one to remove it  I assume you can raise it about a foot  as crazy as that sounds  because otherwise the rear seat would be unsafe for tall people  At the same time  I doubt many people will raise the rear headrests so much  most people leave them all the way down for aesthetics and driver visibility  So this seat seems unsafe to me given how most people will configure it  And hard for adults to nap in on trips  A final safety detail  the center belt is lap only  The spec sheet touts all of the stuff Ford has done for safety in the new design  including all sorts of airbags  This makes it all the more surprising that they blew the most basic safety stuff  Why did Ford make the rear seatback so low  I suspect it has something to do with the low cargo floor I mentioned earlier  This is great for loading cargo  But it means the second row seat has to fold that much lower to form a flat floor  which forces the seatback to be smaller  This is my hypothesis at least  I didn t fold the seat down  so I haven t tested it  Ford does provide two levels of vents for rear passengers  with a switch to select between them  This is nice  but some of the competition  namely GM  is now doing far more for rear passengers  Ford did do an excellent job with the cargo area  It s large  usefully shaped  well finished  and very easy to access  First  there s that low floor  so you don t have to lift stuff as high as you do with other truck based SUVs to load it  Then  there is the matter of the liftglass  It is nice to be able to open the rear glass without opening the entire tailgate if all you have to do is throw in a shopping bag or two  The problem is that SUVs tend to be so high off the ground that it s not always easy to throw something in through the glass  With the new Explorer  Ford has addressed this problem by having some of the door open with the glass  so that it is like a door within a door  This reduces the liftover to a very manageable height  The XLT I drove was about halfway between the base vehicle and the top of the line Limited  It had your basic amenities such as power driver s seat height adjuster  power windows  cruise  etc  but no more  Nothing you won t find in your typical Taurus from Hertz  At a price of  31 265  perhaps this is all I should expect  After all  if I want more stuff there is always the Eddie Bauer or Limited  and whatever options are available on them  Except no matter how much you load onto the new Explorer  it s going to still feel cheap  It s a matter of the interior materials  They look durable enough  so I guess  cheap  really the right word  But they look durable like materials designed for heavy duty commercial use do  This interior looks like it was designed for a work truck  not one often used as a family vehicle  not to mention one bought more and more as a luxury vehicle  The styling of the interior reinforces this impression  It s a very plain  very functional design  Like with so many aspects of this vehicle  nothing to write home about  good or bad  Except that it s not good  which if you want good is bad   On the road  As many faults as I found with the new Explorer before even driving it  they might have been forgotten if the vehicle delivered in the ride and handling department  After all  that s what I was really looking forward to trying out in the first place  So how well did the impressive spec sheet translate to the real world  Not well at all  I was sorely disappointed  Even in moderate turns  I didn t attempt any aggressive maneuvers  the new Explorer leans heavily and plows  Heavy understeer  The steering is fairly decent for an SUV it s only a bit on the light side for my tastes but there s just no joy to be had here  IRS or no  this truck remains a sloppy handler  The sole bright spot in the handling is a very tight turning circle for such a large vehicle  I wish my compact car turned this sharply  And it s not just that the springs and shock valving are too soft  Handling has not simply been sacrificed for ride quality  Fairly minor imperfections in the road surface made the entire vehicle quiver  I suspect the body on frame construction has something to do with this  The old Explorer seemed to have soft body mounts to help the ride  with the result that the body would shimmy on the frame over bumps  Though the new truck is definitely an improvement  it seems this trait has been carried over  Very sad  Worse  every bump sends a shudder up through the steering column  I like to be able to feel the road through the wheel  but at some point road feel becomes  kick back  Don t get me wrong  the ride is generally comfortable  These problems may even be most noticeable at low speeds over minor to moderate road imperfections  But all of this shimmying and shuddering makes the new Explorer feel far less solid than the stats on the new body and frame suggest it should be  These sensations say  work truck  not  family vehicle  and definitely not  luxury  The main quality lapse I noticed in the vehicle I drove was a minor squeak in the dash around the instruments  There may be other problems lurking  The launch of the new vehicle was delayed about six weeks to fix lingering quality issues  Overall I suspect quality will be about the same as with the old Explorer  which is to say about average  maybe a touch below average  On the sparsely populated positive side of the ledger  the new Explorer is fairly quiet  In contrast to the smaller Escape  road noise is especially low  I had to strain to hear the tires  which for the record were Michelins  Wind noise is moderate even at highway speeds  Unfortunately  more bad news is not far away  The six is just barely up to moving this much vehicle  Thankfully Ford added a gear between first and what used to be second a few years ago  so that once the transmission does shift you remain in the engines powerband  I never felt like the engine was letting me down I could accelerate as quickly as I d want to in regular driving but the engine makes a lot of noise while going about its work  It s not an entirely unpleasant sound I ve certainly heard nastier sounds coming from engines  But it always seems like the engine is working quite hard  if not quite straining  In regular driving  using about 1 3 throttle to accelerate  the transmission shifted at about 4000 RPM  This is a fairly high shift point for regular driving  A bit more throttle  and the tranny shifts at 5000 you get the idea  So while this engine moves the vehicle well enough  I suspect fuel economy will be very poor  High shift points will do that  All in all  between the suspension and the just adequate engine the new Explorer was not at all fun to drive  Maybe SUV buyers don t expect their vehicles to be fun to drive  I personally do  so this alone would be a deal killer for me  The eight will not be available for another month or two  I might test drive a V8 Limited once one is available  I don t expect the difference to be large enough to sway my basic opinion of the vehicle  but there is always that chance  Update  9 19 2001  I recently drove a Mercury Mountaineer with the 240 horsepower V8 and leather  The eight performed only marginally better than the six  It lacked the torquey feel engines of this size usually have  As with the six  even half throttle resulted in 4 000 5 000 RPM shifts  This engine should not have to work this hard  I have no idea why it does  At any rate  the six in the GM SUVs performs much better than Ford s eight  The Mercury s two tone leather made for a more luxurious interior  but parts such as the console detracted from the ambiance I did not do any off road driving  Given the on road experience  I do not expect this is a good vehicle for serious off road driving  The suspension is too soft  the handling too clumsy  and the vehicle is just too big for that sort of thing  Of course few people use Explorers this way  For light duty SUV stuff  like driving on snow or unpaved roads  it should be adequate   Last words  Ford has a lot at stake with the new Explorer  From the spec sheet it appears they went all out to guarantee that the Explorer will continue to be the best selling SUV  The inclusion of an independent rear suspension is especially impressive  Unfortunately  while the size and utility of the cargo area is exceptional  the new Explorer surprisingly falls short in many other areas  This fact was highlighted by my second test drive of the day  GM has also just introduced totally redesigned versions of its mid sized SUVs  There s no IRS  there s no available third row seat  at least not yet  and GM has fallen short so often in the past that I didn t expect nearly as much from these new vehicles  Once again a test drive surprised me  this time in a good way  For details  check out my review of the GMC Envoy  Though the GMC stickered for quite a bit more than the Ford  I suspect that they cost about the same comparably equipped   Once comprehensive pricing information is available I will update this part of the review  As for Ford  I d advise a bunch of quick revisions to the new Explorer  Otherwise  they can kiss their market leadership goodbye  A mediocre SUV was good enough in the past  But the competition is not staying still  so mediocre just isn t going to cut it much longer
