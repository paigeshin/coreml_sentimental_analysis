 OK  I finally went and did it  I took a test drive in the redesigned version of my truck  I guess I was kind of happy to be blissfully ignorant there for awhile  I was so in love with my  95 regular cab Ranger that I didn t want to have the myth shattered by driving the new one and risking disappointment  But  nevertheless  my curiosity got the best of me and I began to realize it s been awhile since I did a review on an actual car  So off it was to my nearest Ford dealership to see what they ve done with my truck I was quite surprised to find that they let me take the test drive alone  Not unhappy  mind you  but surprised  I was standing there while they put on the temporary plates expecting the salesman to jump into the passenger seat  but he just said   You know the area well  In response to my nod he tossed me the keys and said   Enjoy the ride  All the better for you  the reader  as I was able to get a better idea of performance than if I d had to treat it with kid gloves Equipment and options  I drove a 2001 XLT with the extended cab  four doors  rear jump seats  sliding rear windows  air  power mirrors  locks  and windows  anti lock brakes  and the premium stereo with CD and cassette  Quite a nicely equipped truck  There was nothing else in particular I thought I might need  In fact  I thought I could do without the cruise control  which I personally don t like to use  but it was a nifty feature for those interested  All in all  a very good bargain considering that it stickered for  18 600 Exterior  I m not too pleased with it  to be honest  The front has been drastically redesigned  while the rear is only slightly touched up with a lightly modified tail light treatment  The front makes this truck look far too much like a utilitarian appliance  with homely looking headlights on either side of a rather boring looking grill  It doesn t look as bad though with the body colored grill and bumper  My only problem with the tail lights was that it always seems weird to me when the white back up lights are on top of the cluster  as was the case here  The white looks better on the bottom  I know  I know  a strange hang up to be sure  but it s the way I feel  Overall  this truck is not particularly ugly or repulsive  just boring looking  They would have done much better by modifying the front fascia on the 98 2000 Rangers than they did with this one  If it were white I might have trouble distinguishing it from my washing machine The cast aluminum deep dish wheels are beautiful  I believe they had five spokes  They re a carryover from previous years and probably my favorite rim that comes with this truck  The 15 inch wheels and tires looked a bit small in the wheel wells though  I d probably need to go for a 4X4 or an Edge 4x2 with something a bit bigger  perhaps some 16 s The bed was a styleside  not those uselessly small flareside setups you see on some street trucks  The tail gate had the same removal system as the one on my truck  which is extremely easy and convenient  Pop two latches  flip the gate to about a 45 degree angle  and pull it out  The whole thing takes maybe 30 seconds It took me awhile to figure out what these weird looking things on the side bed rails were  I don t know if Ford was trying to come up with some sort of futuristic looking tie down bar or what  but it seems like they re for style more than anything else  They look like cheap  gaudy body cladding  except that it was on the rails instead of on the lower body panels  I guess it was an honorable attempt to blend bed rail protection with cargo securing tie downs  so I do give them points for that  But the tie downs on these rails were actually pretty difficult to use  as they were hidden out of sight beneath their protruding lips  If I get one  which is doubtful  I will put on real stainless steel tie down bars  not those cheap looking plastic pieces of junk Grade  C  for the exterior  Get rid of those bed mounted tie downs and change the front fascia Interior  As you might guess  I was less and less eager to get in the longer I looked at the truck  but I had already gone this far  The first thing I noticed was the vastly improved seats  My Ranger s 60 40 split bench offers almost no lumbar support  causing small aches to develop in my lower back after a couple hour s driving  The seats on this Ranger s 60 40 split bench were excellent for a truck  I could feel very good contouring at my lower back  right where the seats on previous Rangers got really flat  There was also good thigh support and noticeably more side bolstering  Not sports car like by a long shot  but it was nice to actually feel the seats curve up just a bit to keep me in place in tight curves The interior was a charcoal grey with black accents for the door handle  instrument gauge  and the radio housing  It looked a bit more upscale than the lighter colors  and the only parts that really looked cheap were the smooth plastics on the black inserts  This was a four door model  which made access to the rear area very easy for placement of groceries and luggage  One thing I would like to see on the Ranger that I ve found in the Tundra  but no other four  door pickup  is handles on the outsides so you don t have to go though opening the front door first to get the rears open The jump seats back there are still a joke  I wouldn t even put small kids back there because they d be unsafe in a crash due to the inward facing seating position  And those are the only people who would be comfy back there  Of course  it s only fair to remind you that pretty much every pickup in this segment except the Dodge Dakota  with its forward facing rear bench  tells that same joke  and you ll have to look at the extended cabs in full sized trucks or consider the light duty crew cabs if you want rear seating that is at least endurable in a pickup  Any adults who are not shaped like children will not be happy after more than a short 10 20 minute hop in those seats  which is about how long it usually takes for their novelty to wear off  The cup holders for those jump seats are an even crueler joke since no one should really be back there  The cup holders for front passengers are still in a bad place  placed on the floor of the cabin where they re difficult to reach  I d prefer a setup like I see on some S10 s where they unfold from the front of the center console  But one now has a removable carrying case for hot thermoses and other drinks The glove box is deep enough to be very useful  but that was about the limit of the lockable hidden storage inside the cab  The only other storage was a map pocket in each door  A locking bin under one of the front seats would be a welcome touch  I did like the special compartment for the jack though  On my truck it was just thrown back there haphazardly The gauges are all simple and clear  pretty much standard issue equipment since the early nineties  They have nice big white letters  You get engine and oil temperature gauges  a speedometer  fuel gauge  one to measure battery charge  and a tachometer  All the information I would wish to know  A useful twelve volt power outlet is displayed prominently next to the radio  This should be a very convenient way to run power tools and other small appliances off the battery  Buttons to operate the power accessories are on the door armrests  They were big  clear  and easy to figure out  Visibility was a big problem though  I get really annoyed nowadays at what seems too much of a willingness on the part of manufacturers to sarifice safety for style  Sleek  tiny side view mirrors may integrate well with a car s body  but they make for anoying blindspots  The rear view mirror was not long enough  The side view mirrors were too small and weirdly shaped  They angled upward sharply on the inside lower corner  right at a big blind spot  Buttons on the radio were big and fat and clearly marked  It s too bad really  The radio was very easy to use and offered dual media capabilities  but it offered flat  weak bass  However  it did have clear  finely detailed sound  The tape deck was a full logic unit with seek and scan functions  always an impressive thing to me  Definitely not powerful enough in the low ranges for my ears though  I would have to either specify that ground pounding 500 watt plus unit that will soon be available in the Edge or just order the cheapest radio I can get and swap it out for an after market system I noticed much more head  hip  shoulder  and legroom all around up front  The Ranger has now finally improved from liveable to very comfortable  with the much improved seating and increased space  When I put the key in I noticed that that stupid latch by the ignition that you need to push to release it is finally gone  thank god  However  the foot operated emergency brake no longer clicks when applied  something I missed  It just feels more reassuring when you can hear it go down to the last click when putting it on Overall  A  for the interior  It was much improved  Almost all serious shortcomings from previous models were addressed  with just a few annoyances left Ride  I started it up and pulled into traffic  One of the first things I noticed was the extremely low engine noise levels  The new 4 0 purrs like a kitten and makes smooth  refined noises at all speeds  None of the coarse  boomy quality of the old push rod engines The noises that really got to me came from wind  My  95 does not push air as loudly at over 90 mph as this one does at 60  One step forward in cost reduction for Ford  one step backward for noise levels  This is one loud truck  I believe the wind noise would slowly drive me insane on long trips  and that damn stereo isn t even powerful enough to overcome it Small bumps were well damped and never particularly jarring  The big ones really upset the cabin though and even elicited some rattles Ride  Gets a B  that would be vastly improved if they didn t skimp on sound deadening materials Handling  Body lean was very limited  and the truck felt sharp and agile in all situations  The steering was heavier than on some previous models I ve driven  including my own  allowing for much better road feel and requiring fewer inputs to plot a straight ahead course on the highway  I felt just a tiny bit of rear end floatiness at high speeds  but it was barely noticeable  In rapid high speed transitions there were no excess body motions  Even at over 50 mph  it was the same over and over  I steered sharply  the truck turned to its new course  and that was it  No bobbing and weaving  And what s best  on some tire spinning maneuvers that always upset the rear axle in my Ranger  this truck stayed composed and glued to the ground  In low speed parking lot maneuvers it seemed to require fewer twists of the wheel in tight turning  Braking was always straight and secure  though the brakes didn t grab quite as aggressively as I would have liked on sharp application Handling  A good  solid A  The truck points where you want it to go with no drama or excess body motions   Acceleration  This truck s biggest glaring weak point besides wind noise  I just never felt like the 4 0 V6 and the automatic transmission were working as a team  They felt more like enemies to me   Downshift now  screamed the throttle   Who s gonna make me  huh tough guy  Are you  is the defiant reply from the transmission  The power curve is weak  Sure  you do get a sharp kick when you floor it from a stand still  Things get quite boring after about 2 seconds though  as it gets weaker and weaker towards the mid ranges  There was a noticeable and disappointing lack of pulling power at medium and high speeds without a down shift  and those down shifts were slow and reluctant  usually coming 3 4 seconds after I asked for them  Passing power at higher speeds was OK because this motor likes to rev and makes good power at higher rpm s  but it still wasn t great even in lower gears  I had a feeling this had more to do with the 5 speed automatic s gearing than any inadequacy on the part of the new 4 0  And the transmission still had a tendency to leave me hanging  In general it didn t seem intuitive at all  And two different times at a stand still I could feel the idle skip ever so slightly  I wasn t sure if it was an engine problem or a torque converter problem  but it was not reassuring  The 4 0 does not come with stick right now  or so I hear  Guess that means I will not be going with the 4 0  The automatic just seemed to suck up too much of this engine s potential Acceleration  The engine could use a flatter power curve with more low speed torque and both a manual transmission and an improved automatic  C  sorry to say Overall tally  B  but let me emphasize that it just barely missed a C  The great ride  handling  and increased capacity really helped raise the grade My advice to Ranger fans considering this truck  Hold on to your older Rangers a little while longer  The 2001 redesign is not the huge step forward it would seem  It seems almost like a mediocre stop gap measure to fill in until the totally new truck arrives  Wait until the complete redesign coming up in 2003 to see if the Ranger can regain its greatness
