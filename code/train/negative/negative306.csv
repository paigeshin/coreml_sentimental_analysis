 I bought my 1990 Ford Bronco 2 years ago  It has a 350 5 8L V8 4X4  I bought it for  5000 00 and have spent that much plus more getting it fixed  It had one owner before me  When I got it it ran really great  at first  The windshield leaks  the front of the roof leaks so everytime it rains the inside of my truck gets wet  It also leaks wear the pedals are  It is currently in the shop getting the back brakes replaced plus all of the seals the axle that the brakes destroyed  My engine has  800 00 worth of work to be done  I have replaced my left window motor twice and the left door lock motor once  The air conditioner is also being worked on  I have replaced the exhaust system  The 4X4 has also had to be replaced  I know I m forgetting other things  I only get 12 mpg and with gas prices the way they are it costs me around  200 00 a month  Right now I have 175 000 plus miles and a very big headache  I am a little person and feel very safe in this big truck but that is about the only good thing about it  DO NOT buy this vehicle Any one who has a Bronco I wish them the best of luck  I think its time I get something else
