 Bought this car new in 1994  at night  in a snowstorm  I thought I was getting a champagne colored vehicle  But when I picked it up  it was a horrible pinkish bronze color  Has to be the ugliest color Ford ever used What do I love  It was cheap  It s got 70  on it and still runs pretty well  I ve recently had to replace broken springs  struts  brakes  rotors  and the exhaust system  but until now  other than an electrical problem  below  it has only needed oil  gas and tires  The guy who recently worked on it said  quot you must really love this car quot  To be honest  if I could afford it right now  I d give it to the kids and get something nicer and which had a quieter ride Early on  I had a lot of trouble with the cooling fan rotor burning out  Then the radio would come on when the car was shut off  The fan rotor burned out three times before the dimwit mechanics at my dealership finally figured out that it was a faulty ignition  which never really shut off  Once the ignition was replaced  the electrical problems ceased  So if you think your car is possessed  have the ignition checked I wouldn t buy another one just because I m ready to move on  Our first Escort  81  was a fiasco  We only bought another one because it was cheap and the dealership is close by br br
