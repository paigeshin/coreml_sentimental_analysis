 Here s everything I have nice to say about this car I purchased my 1994 Thunderbird from a Seattle car dealership 6 months ago  It was in impeccable condition and had 38 000 miles on it  The previous owners were a retired couple who had kept the car garaged the entire time they had it  They elected to trade it in because they wanted a full size Buick  Purchase price for this vehicle was  7800  and the original sticker price for this V6 equipped version was  17 000 I would have never anticipated buying a Ford Thunderbird this old  but the low mileage and condition of the car were what sold me  Compared to the 1978 El Camino I d been driving  this car was pure nirvana to drive One thing I like about the car is its smooth ride  The suspension is not so soft that you feel detached from the road  but far more comfortable than a subcompact like my Ford Escort  a great little econobox  by the way  but that s a future epinion Fit and finish of the car is above average  Seats are comfortable without being overly soft  Leg room is ample in front  but in back is only adequate My car has cloth seats  leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter  power driver s seat adjustment  power mirrors  overdrive  cruise control and for speaker JBL factory stereo with cassette  Sound system is OK  and now that everyone has CD s  the system is a candidate for upgrading Now for the bad news   buyer beware At approximately 60 000 miles the engine suffered catastrophic head gasket failure and completely toasted the engine  The engine had to be replaced to the tune of  4200 but in my case the bulk of this was covered by the extended warranty I purchased   Ford s reconditioned engines address this head gasket problem  The  94 T Birds did have a Ford  Customer Care  notification on record  not exactly a recall  but something just short of that  because of the problem they were having with blown head gaskets  Unfortunately  this notification is no longer valid on  94 T Birds My advice   stay away from this car due to this head gasket problem
