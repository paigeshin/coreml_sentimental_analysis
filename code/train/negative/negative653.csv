 As a Social Worker I find myself on the Georgia highways and byways usually doing a lot of commuting especially when it comes to traveling with a group of children  If you ve ever taken a trip with a bunch of teenagers then you know the importance of traveling in the right vehicle  Which brings me to my most recent outing to the movies with my group of weekend pre teens in the 2001 Ford Windstar LX  Frankly  as a bachelor the minivan would not be my first choice as a slime and trim sporty auto  Primarily due to its style since minivans usually have  family  written all over them  However for those looking for a family van you may find one of the six models of the 2001 Ford Windstar to your liking  The models or trims which is a term used in the automotive world to describe the different styles available which includes your base model  the LX  SE  SEL  the limited or the SE Sport  The vehicle we used was the Windstar 2001 LX passenger van  The Windstar van made me feel like I was turning into my father  I immediately began having flashbacks of our station wagon and all the family discussion regarding that vehicle  The other families in our neighborhood referred to us as the  Brady Bunch   The Brady Bunch was 1969 ABC TV series in which the Brady family used a 1958 Plymouth Station Wagon The Windstar is synonymous with practical family transportation and although I don t consider it stylish  and find it to plain for my taste  for some this versatile vehicle is becoming as popular as the 1968 Plymouth Station Wagon  This passenger van has a savage V 6 12 valve 4 speed electronic automatic transmission engine with an electronic ignition  It s almost identical to its 2000 Windstar predecessor with its 3 0 liter 6 cylinder engine  When driving this vehicle you can really feel front wheel drive the pulling to the front wheels  On the highway this machine floats like a 1970 Cadillac  If you ve ever road in a 1970 Cadillac you will remember how it almost floats like a boat on the highway  The van is a little bouncy on the road probably due to the soft suspension that seems to sway when driving  The front suspension uses the highly recommended MacPherson struts  while at the rear a twist beam axle acts as its own stabilizer bar with its suspension coil springs  The Windstar s steel body is very rigid  despite it s rack and pinion steering system it s considered a heavyweight in the minivan world  There is nothing fancy about the outside since exterior features are fairly rudimentary red color  Its red from the front and rear colored bumpers to the red colored grille  The Windstar s seven passenger seating offers lots of room and comfortable seating for smaller framed people however if you are traveling with a teenagers wearing baggy clothes it seats five comfortably  There are three rows of seats  the front bucket seats with the fixed headrest and armrest remind are fairly comfortable for the driver  however you can only adjust these two seats so far  Perhaps in a 2001 I was expecting a softer seat  or perhaps captain chairs like the seat on the Star Trek Enterprise  The seats were fairly comfortable during our trip to the movies however I would suspect that they would not be as equally comfortable on long distance trip  It s nice that the passenger seat is adjustable and removable with full folding 3 person bench second row seating  Legroom is plentiful if you are 5 9  any taller and you may feel a bit cramped  The Windstar LX features the much talked about 4 wheel anti locking braking system and dual airbags  with adjustable seatbelts plus daytime running halogen headlamp lights  Although the daytime running lights are popular  I personally don t like them  Perhaps its related to my childhood memories of attending funerals with my Dad driving  following a processional of cars streaming their lights during the day  Standard equipment on all of the 2001 Windstar LX include tinted glass  an AM FM stereo system with four speakers two in the front and two in the rear  It also features a passive anti theft system  cupholders and a locking glove box with a light installed  The Windstar is a functional piece of machinery  In a 2001 vehicle I was looking for more up to date features and gadgets  The simple dashboard with the typical Ford layout is boring  Ford is notorious for its poor ergonomics and dashboard layout  On the dashboard you will find the typical analog instrumentation with a tachometer  trip odometer  water temp gauge  and the usual warning indicators including the oil pressure  battery  lights on  key in ignition  low fuel  low washer fluid  door ajar  brake fluid  the only that s new to me is the bulb failure light In all fairness the LX does have a sliding door on the driver s side which seemed unusual at first and took a little getting use to  This van is ideal for people that want to use their minivan for a small business because it allows you the ability to toss out the rear bench seat  The Ford Windstar is an affordable minivan ranging between  20 000 to 35 000 depending upon the model you choose  Although there are no recalls on the Windstar 2001 LX  this particular Ford has a history of recalls and mechanical problems  In 1996 there was a recall on the rear power windows because the connections failed and the wiper switch needed to be replaced  So far it has not been reported that the Windstar 2001 faces the challenges of its predecessor s  It s been noted by Ford that the Windstar is the first minivan to earn the U  S  government s five star front crash test rating  The safety system  includes dual stage front air bags  crash severity sensors  safety belt usage sensor  driver seat position sensor  and safety belt pretensions plus the lift gate comes with a high mounted lamp which provides excellent light at night  We road on 4 good P215 70R15 BSW tires w  15 inch 5 spoke wheel coverings  However if you get a flat you ll be riding around on a donut since this vehicle comes with a mini spare tire  The Windstar 2001 LX uses unleaded gas  yet guzzles it like a 1970 Cadillac  In a time when gas prices are sky rocketing this 3 8 liter engine is not the most economical  Albeit my experience with the Windstar LX was limited  and in spite of this vans impressive safety rating  this vehicle would not be my first choice for family travel  It would be ideal if Ford would match safety and customer satisfaction  I was looking for a little bit more out of a 2001
