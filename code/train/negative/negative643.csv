 Back in December 1995  I purchased a 1995 Ford Thunderbird LX V8 with 15 000 miles on it  When I was handed the keys after signing all the paperwork and had put a deposit on 4 days prior when I first test drovie it  the car now had 16 000 miles on it  One of the salesman decided he was going to use this car to commute back and forth to work  this was the start of my problems I specifically had a car alarm installed by the dealer as my prior vehicle  a convertible Suzuki Sidekick  which was an absolutely wonderful vehicle  was a target for theives  Well  they didn t install a second switch to cut off the alarm should the remotes die or the alarm short circuits  I discovered this 6 months later and they said there was nothing they could do about it unless I paid  Oh well  I just hoped nothing would happen  First thing I did when driving out of the dealership was get new snow tires   it snowed that night Well  during the course of owning this vehicle  for 4 and half years  I put about 50 000 miles on it  Not too bad  I went through 5 sets of complete breaks  All the U Joints and CV Joints were replaced twice  The radiator and fan  not the fan belt but the fan  was replaced three times  When I got the car  I noticed the antenna was bent and the windshield wiper motor was shot  Brought it to a closer Lincoln Dealer to have these items fixed under warranty to discover the dealership I purchased it from signed me up under their own extended warranty   not the Ford warranty which I specified 10 different times  We had to go back over there and pay 800 dollars more  Then they fixed the two problems Lets see  the transmission was rebuilt twice  the driver side window would stick on occasion and not shut completely  the radio was awful  and the kicker   the Ford service people don t know what the problem is  Ooooohhhh I get so steamed when I think of this   I find out toward the end of my warranty after dealing with countless service people being rude to me  telling me it was a figment of my imagination that the car is stalling and three dealerships to figure out that there was no oil in the engine even though the dipstick said there was oil  They told me that happens when an engine gets old   and refused to fix it under warranty During the time I owned this vehicle   I contacted Ford corporate repeatedly and they never responded  Finally 2 months before the warranty ended   someone called me back   all sarcasm aside  they finally tell me there is a dispute settlement board   oh  I was supposed to get a free loaner anytime my car was in the shop for warranty repairs  Never got it   now I wanted my money back  The Dispute Settlement board refused and conveniently stated this is between me and the individual dealerships  They also said it was past my warranty   I sent it in two weeks before it expired  you get the idea I will never buy or claim ownership another Ford product again  They left such a taste of vile in my mouth  I have a Jeep now and its wonderful  Ford  may you rot in a garbage can   your service and vehicles are way below acceptable standards
