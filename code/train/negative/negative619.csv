 This was the first car I got when I turned 16  and I haven t liked it one bit since then  Sure it s cheap  and it gets good gas mileage  but it is not comfortable and does not handle well under bad conditions  This past winter I went out one day to go get some baby food for the new baby while my mom was still at work  it was snowing out but I thought nothing of it at the time  No more then 1000 feet away from my house I go to hit the brakes  and they lock up as my car goes sliding into a ditch  The back seats in this car are very uncomfortable also  I recently was going to take it on a trip to Niagra Falls  about a 3 hour drive  but decided against it because anyone in the backseat would be very uncomfortable the whole ride  I wish I could trade it in and get a new car br br
