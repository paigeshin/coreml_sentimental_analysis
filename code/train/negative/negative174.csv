 I just got rid of this vehicle  My family bought it used in 1995 and it was my first car that I had driven from the moment I learned to drive until just a few weeks ago  During the time that I owned the vehicle the rotor cracked causing the wheel to fall off  luckily while moving slowly  The air conditioner went bad around 60K miles and never really worked again after several repairs  The transmission started failing before 100K and finally went out around 110K miles  I had the transmission replaced and it began to fail only 15K miles later  The water pump also went out and the brakes began to stick  Even though only the first rust spots were beginning to form on the vehicle  it felt as though it was only a matter of days before something else would go wrong  so I traded it in for a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire  Unfortunately  the dealer would only offer  450 for the trade in value because of its poor condition  This poor condition  after 127 000 miles was only the result of regular wear and tear and more than  5000 invested in repairs over the course of 5 years  If you are a regular mechanic and think you can get a bargain on this vehicle then go for it  but otherwise I would recommend steering clear br br
