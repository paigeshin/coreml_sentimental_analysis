 Well  on a road trip to St  George  Utah I rode in one for 5 hours on each trip  there and back  It was a base model F 150 with a stick and base wheels and no rear bumper The ride was pretty smooth  The suspension was really soft  I don t think this one was made for towing or heavy duty work  The interior however  wasn t very roomy and comfortable  The seats were rigid and not very comfortable As for speed  it was fairly good at keeping its momentum on hills although it did lose some speed  I think it would keep its speed better than most other cars with less than 200 horse power  It wasn t that great on acceleration with the manual gearbox The transmission was not very nice either  When you shift it and let the clutch out it jerks the truck no matter how smoothly you perform it  It is also geared way too high  It can t put any power to the wheels when it needs it like in acceleration If you are going to buy a new F 150 then get the one with bucket seats  automatic transmission  stiff suspension and a towing package  That way you will get some torque going to the wheels when you want it  The bucket seats would make it a more enjoyable ride  The Chevrolet and GMC seem to ride more smoothly and be able to take more heavy duty work br br
