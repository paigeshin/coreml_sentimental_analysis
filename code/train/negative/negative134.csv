 Well I for one am personally glad they stopped making the Ford Probe  I actually love the look of the car  It was my first choice for a new car just coming out of college  Back in the early 80 s the look of the Probe did not really move me  But when they redesigned it I totally fell in love with it  For over a year it was the only car I wanted  Well in 1994 I purchased a brand new 1993 Ford Probe  It was the last one on the lot in the perfect shade a green the actual color I had been dreaming about  Well from then on it was a jinx  Within my first month I had to get a brand new set of breaks because they started squeaking two week after I got the car  Afterwards I continued to have minor problems with it  such as alignment and so on  But I stilled loved the car because it was so cute  Then for some reason my engine locked up  right after Christmas  I could not understand it because I got regular maintenance  Well thank goodness for extended warranties  Well I put the car in the shop to get a brand new motor  and when I went to pick it up from the Ford service dealer low and behold someone had hit my car and completely tore the rearview mirror off the passengers  side  Well of course they offered to pay for it but I had to bring it back on the following Monday so they could get me a loaner car  Well before I could get it back to them Monday morning  another car hit me and totaled my car  Well I was faced with getting a new car and I chose the 96 Ford Probe  Stupid me  Three months after getting the car my transmission goes out  Completely  I m still thankful for warranties Since then it had never really driven right  The performance of the car used to be so good  Greta pick up  speed ect  But the problem you encounter are sickening  After talking to some other Probe owners they have all encountered difficulties with the car  I m really sad that such a good looking car has so many problems under the hood br br
