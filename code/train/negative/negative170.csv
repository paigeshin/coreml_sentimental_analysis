 I have a 91 Ford Taurus 3 0L AXODE in Silver Grey  This car is excellent for a family of four  and has plenty of leg room  and for a 91 a well designed ageless feel to it  The car has 200000 km  It was the first attempt by Ford to use Dr  Deming s Japanese quality theory  It s still going  however I do use rust check spray every other year to stop salt damage in the Canadian winter  The car handles very well  is low and wide and I never feel unsafe driving  The car still has original alternator  steering  radiator  fuel system  engine computer  emission control  convertor  front shocks  engine  wiper motor  master cylinder  fuel pump tank  I had to replace the transmission  below  starter  failed relay  brake booster  front bearing  front CV  right  muffler  tie rods  inner and outer  front bearings  water pump  2  plugs  wires  cap rotor  battery  A C clutch  A C seals  Apart from the transmission  I consider this all normal wear and tear Now the A C has failed  Last year there was a musty odour  and perhaps the evaporator has failed  Regardless it will cost 1500 2000 to fix and is simply not worth it at this age  A C must be the most unreliable part of any car  Transmission Failure   Avoid cars with the 3 8L engine  gasket failure  and all cars from 1991 onwards  They suffer from weak transmissions  clutch failure and lube tubes  All Taurus Sable and Windstar are prone to expensive repairs  I have had to replace the transmission at 130000km and 6 5 years  Ford attitude is unacceptable even though they extended the warranty  I should have been a total recall  Once the warranty is over  Ford are not interested in further compensation    All being said  however for a second hand vehicle   I paid 10000 and i ve owned it 8 5 years  I think I have had overall value for money but I do not like the shoddy transmission If you own a Ford  expect niggling problems  and possible major component failures  I suggest you invest in a web based extended warranty and buy a 2 3 year old product  At least you still have service life out of the car  and did not pay much for a decent family car  Check out the web carefully for upcoming class actions and general comments on this car It also helps if you are a bit of a do it yourselfer and are able to figure out what might be the problem  before you go to your chosen independant local mechanic br br
