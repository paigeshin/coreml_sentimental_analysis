 I bought my 1997 Taurus LX from Tom Wood Ford in Indianapolis in April of 1998  It was a demo and had 6 000 miles on it  Listing for  28 700  I paid  21 000 for it  I asked the dealer twice to provide an owner s manual  none was ever provided so I switched dealers to Capital City Ford  I have had the Taurus in the shop MANY times for non routine items  including  The cigarette plug broke  the overdrive switch broke  a component in the steering linkage failed  and the stereo is garbage  Let me tell you about the  700 mach 460 radio Ford is so proud of  It has intermittent static in the front speakers  and I have taken it to Capital City Ford FIVE times to be repaired  The static is still there  The service department will not replace the stereo because they are afraid Ford will charge them for the item if it tests OK at Ford  In the meantime  both Ford and Capital City have ensured that my wife s next car will be a Daimler Chrysler  In fairness  I have a Ford Ranger that is flawless  but my Taurus is a piece of junk  I called Ford to have them tell the dealership to fix the problem  and they gave me the runaround  Goodbye Ford  hello Chrysler 300M
