 Just a warning this is a review of the Taurus station wagon  not the sedan The car is nice  Not amazing  but nice  Its a good family car  good steering  but both the braking and acceleration feel unresponsive  The brakes have to be pushed pretty far down before they start working  and it always feels as if the engine is trying to catch up with my accereleration Furthermore  my transmission has started to die  The transmission is always banging into place The car  however  has been very reliable  It has 120 000 miles on it  and has only been in the shop for a new head gasket  It has not even needed a new timing belt  which  to the best of my understanding  is expected to break after 60 000 miles br br
