 The first serious driving lesson I ever had was in this car  so I have a certain soft spot for it  My father frighteningly guided me through the suburban roads of Concord  Massachusetts as I learned the nuances of control and timing that comprise the art of driving  I will always love the 1992 Ford Taurus for heralding me to the wonderful  amazing world of driving  But  I must concede that it is a far from perfect piece of machinery My father owns the Taurus GL  mid range model  with the optional 3 8 liter V6 engine  With a reasonable price  this car is the perfect family hauler  or at least it would be if were not for a few problems This car is very spacious  While the seats are not exceptionally comfortable  there is plenty of leg room front and back for just about any potential passenger  Because of this fact  long road trips are not a large hassle with the Taurus  The cargo space is simply massive  larger than most other wagons and some SUVs The handling of the Taurus wagon is not spectacular  The steering feel is somewhat heavy  almost truck like  The brakes are also very heavy  although they work exceptionally well with the optional anti lock system  On turns  the car goes where you want it  but torque steer is VERY heavy and the wheel does not smoothly spin back to its center but instead jerks and stops repeatedly on the way there  Still  the handling is appropriate to this type of car  and compared to other American made station wagons  it is actually pretty good The internal controls of the car are placed very well  The window and lock controls are placed as well and are as easy to operate as those in Japanese cars  The Speedometer and tachometer are very clear  The speedometer does not go very high so the exact speed is very easy to determine from a quick glance  The only control that I do not like is the gear shifter attached to the steering column  Unless you have the exact sequence memorized  which is not too hard  shifting gears is difficult  Despite my preferential gripe  this feature frees more floor space and makes possible seating for a small person between the driver and the front passenger The Wagon looks nice enough  Not terribly sleek  but not heinously ugly like the 1996 and later Taurus models  I personally think that this particular generation  92    95  is the best looking of all Taurus models The Taurus is pretty safe  My father was hit on the side at highway speed and he walked away without a scratch  the only result being a large dent on one door  The frame was not warped at all and the door was all that had to be fixed The 3 8 liter V6 gives only 140 hp  but they are available at a low RPM  3800  and they are accompanied by a whopping 215 pounds foot of torque  These numbers mean that the engine has more than enough muscle to tackle any hill or haul any load just so long as blazing speed or off the line performance are not needed  Actually  the acceleration is pretty good for a larger mid sized wagon  This does come at the expense of gas mileage  In city driving  the mileage is well under 20 miles per gallon Unfortunately  this 3 8 liter V6 power plant is apparently one of the least reliable engines ever made by Ford  Together with Ford s standard average to below average reliability  we have a volatile combination  My father spends quite a bit of money on repairs  most recently and notably  he had to have the transmission rebuilt and he had to have extensive work done on the brakes  These repairs were done at both great expense and great inconvenience The Taurus is a good family hauler with decent power and good space  however the reliability problems make it hard for me to recommend it even though I very much want to
