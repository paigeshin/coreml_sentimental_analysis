 I bought a 1994 Mustang LX coupe for a decent price  but quickly learned it was not quite a solid vehicle  After having owned 3 Mustang convertibles in the past  I was confident that the new body style wouldn t have been a compromise in quality  but from the day I brought it home  it had problems  I was told that I would have to replace the transmission to fix the shutter  but a full servicing fixed that problem for the most part  it still didn t shift quite right  but the shutter disappeared  I d had transmission problems with my  93  so I was happy that it only cost  200 to get it fixed this time   but within 3 months  I was sorry I ever purchased the car  At 136k miles  the head gasket blew  When I called the dealership to get a quote on repairs  I was told there had been a recall on this car  so I took it down there after the engine had cooled back down  Turns out  Ford won t back their cars after 100k  and I was going to be stuck with  1200    1500 bill to fix it  I traded it in  got less than 1 3 of what i paid for it  and got a 1996 Thunderbird  and it s a very solid car  My strong recommendation  if you are interested in a 1994 Mustang  is to check its history  Find out if it was recalled for the head gasket before purchasing it  because mine went FAST  Also  I was plagued with permanently squealy brakes that noone could figure out  so make sure it has a good radio to drown out that annoying noise
