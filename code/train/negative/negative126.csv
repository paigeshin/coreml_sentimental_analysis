 There is a great deal of history to contend with when talking about the Mustang  Its appeal to a large segment of American drivers is impressive  and to some degree a Mustang lover will not be swayed by better performance found in foreign automobiles   that s not the point  Their loyalty is to the Mustang brand first and foremost With that history of loyalty has also come a great tradition of performance tuning these cars  so that there are several appealing options available to someone who has some money to spend  and wants a true high end performance machine  They will all cost you  though  the Ford produced Cobra SVT starts at about  34 000 while both Saleen and Roush make impressive models that will cost  35 000    40 000 or more This review  however  concentrates on the models at the other end of the scale  the entry level  affordable Mustang Coupe  The base Mustang comes in three option levels  Standard  Deluxe  and Premium  starting at about  18 000  and going up  500 or so with each level ENGINE DRIVETRAIN The base Mustang comes with a 3 8 litre V6 which makes 193 hp and 225 lb ft of torque  It is a dramatic step down from the V8 available on the higher end models  both in performance  and aesthetics  Where the V8 has the throaty growl you expect from a muscle car  the V6 of course does not  Married to 4 speed automatic  it is relatively quick  but not overly impressive  especially in the low end  You ll be able to merge into traffic and pass without discomfort  but is that really the performance level you want if you re buying a Mustang   I think we re looking for a little more performance  and to get it  you need to step up to the V8 The transmission is another sore spot  If you have to get the V6  stay with the default 5 speed manual instead of upgrading to the automatic  You maximize the performance  of the engine  and still get some performance  feel  with the stick  but the automatic is awful  Early shifts  still some lag when you mash the pedal   not good  The automatic increases your price by almost  800  so I wouldn t bother unless you have to For those who have grown up on today s front wheel drive vehicles  it is also worth noting that this is a rear wheel drive car  Yes  it comes with traction control now  but you will still be surprised if you get into rain or snow and try to gun the engine  The rear end is twitchy  and you ll have a hard time getting it back into shape once it goes EXTERIOR The Mustang retains its burly  muscle car appearance  The high rear end  and sloping windshield into the  fake  hood air intake give it its distinctive appearance that ensure you won t be confused with any other car on the road  That definitely has some appeal in an era when you sometimes can t tell the Jaguar X Type from a Taurus  Individuality is good  With that said  some of the old fit and finish concerns remain  The covers on the fake air dams are flimsy and look ready to come off at a moment s notice  Those air dams are another pet peeve  It smacks of pretend performance to include the hood  intake  with those behind each door  They re not functional for my money  you can leave them off next year  The available  on the Premium model  16 inch machined aluminum wheel are a positive  though  They re beefy  sporty  and fit well with the Mustang style INTERIOR Remember that you re essentially buying a detuned sports car  so the interior is not necessarily designed for touring  You slip down into the bucket seats  and while they re not impossible to get in and out of  some may find the extra effort needed to accomplish this annoying  When inside  the seats are comfortable enough  though if you re any taller than me  5 11  you may be a little cramped  Controls are conveniently located  and are standard Ford issue  The leather wrapped steering wheel available in the Premium model is a nice extra touch  While on the road  a driver unfamiliar with the Mustang may have a few complaints  Wind noise  while reduced from earlier model years  is still more noticeable than it should be  Part of the price you pay for that distinctive appearance  In addition  be aware that visibility is not on par with a larger  higher ride sedan  Again  part of the price you pay for getting into a  sports car  where you sit low The rear seats are utile  but not overly comfortable  Children will have no problem sitting there  but larger adults will be somewhat cramped  especially on longer rides MISCELLANEOUS Ford includes some decent options  Remote keyless entry  6 way power driver s seat  and an in dash 6 CD changer are standard in the Premium model  The ABS and Traction Control are also nice  and offset a bit the difficulty drivers may experience with the rear wheel drive CONCLUSION Ford markets the Mustang to a very specific market of American drivers who appreciate the history  the muscle car feel  and aren t looking for a cookie cutter Accord or Camry to drive around  For about 20 grand  you get a decent ride  a distinctive appearance  and reasonable power  The trade offs are iffy quality  some slightly old technology in the engine  transmission  and design  and poor visibility  If you re comfortable with that trade  this is the car for you  If true performance is your goal with the Mustang  consider stepping up to the higher end models available from either Ford or one of the performance tuning outfits like Saleen or Roush
