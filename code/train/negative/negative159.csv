 While the Ford Taurus is a comfortable  and rather inexpensive car  it won t get high ratings from our family  True to form  this car has lived up to the FORD reputation of  quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  Bought used after our beloved Jetta was totaled in an accident  this car seemed promising at the start  The front seats are plush and comfortable  The back seat is roomy enough for children  fits two car seats easily  but the middle seat is hard and uncomfortable  An arm rest can be brought down in the middle  and there s even a lap shoulder belt for the middle seat  but it feels like you re sitting on a rock hard surface  The back seats also folds down to expand the trunk room for hauling larger items The trunk itself is fairy large  not quite comparable to the roominess of a VW Jetta s trunk  but still plenty of room for playpens or groceries  The air conditioner and heater work well  but sometimes seem slow to kick in  The stereo system is an iffy item  On one hand  it has decent sound  and provides enough bass to make most music palatable  while on the other hand it is part of the console and pretty much irreplaceable  I wouldn t advise buying this car if you re the type to pop stereo systems in and out However nice the amenities seemed at first  we started having problems with it  It features a faulty Ford transmission that s always begging for repair  slipping in and out of gear  If you use any brake pads other than the Ford ones  they squeal  squeak  and squawk within a thousand miles  The disc pads do not just go in with a C Clamp either  you have to buy a special tool that looks like a little block  This makes a simple job a pain to complete Overall  while the Ford Taurus may be inexpensive  fairly comfortable  and feature decent power  it is no fun to constantly be repairing something or trying to figure out just what is squeaking this time  This Taurus needs to be put out to pasture br br
