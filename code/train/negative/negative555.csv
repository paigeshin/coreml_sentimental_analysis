 I live in the Houston area so seing a big truck driving down the road isnt anything special  but seing one of the new F350 s crusin down the road just leaves me at a loss for words  I love theese trucks  They are solid work horses that can handle just about anything you throw their way  We use them for pulling big 5th wheel car trailers to the race track and hauling our cattle trailers around  but they are more than just work horse  They are also beautiful  on the weekend it makes a perfect truck to take out on the town and with the crew cab their is room for plenty of people  When its at the track we get just as many compliments on it as we do our 8 second camaro
