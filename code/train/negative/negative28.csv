 If you have a 1992 Ford Econoline van and bought the vehicle used as I did you will find that the dealer or the factory will not be of any assistance to you if you find that the paint on the horizontal surfaces is falling off  I purchased the vehicle in 1994 and within a year the paint started to delaminate from the body and even though there was a  secret recall   This is a factory related defect confirmed by internal service bulletin  93 8 4   quot Microchecking quot  sent to dealers in April 1993 and covered under your  quot Owner Dialog quot  program  to date nothing has been resolved  I have written numerous letters to no avail  All I can say is if you are looking at Ford products  caveat emptor
