 I bought my first new car in 1994  After many test drives of other SUV s I chose a brand new Ford Explorer Sport  I had it custom made and bought an extended warranty 75 000 miles or 4 years  After a year I started to have problems  I can t remember all the problems  mostly brakes  Every time I brought it in I had to pay a  50 dollar deductible  even though I had a warranty  It was always something I brought my vehicle to a reputable garage in town every 3 000 miles to have the oil changed and I went by the book with all the maintenance that was needed   Ford gave me a book with maintenance checklists  I never failed to miss a 3 000 mile maintenance  I even had the tires rotated when I brought the vehicle in for a oil change  I had the book checked and signed by the mechanic before I left  I never beat on the vehicle or drove it recklessly  I was at 78 000 in August 1997  I was in town and the vehicle died  It was the transmission  I had to have it towed to a local transmission garage  They told me it would cost at least  1 000 to just get it going  not including anything else to do it right  I called Ford and they wouldn t even listen to me  They didn t care that I had proof that I properly maintained my vehicle because a Ford mechanic didn t do the maintenance  They said my Warranty expired 3 000 miles ago  nothing we can do  I had just paid off the vehicle 3 months before and I was stuck with a piece of junk  I also have to say my tires lasted longer than the transmission   I just replaced the tires for the first time a few weeks before  No one at Ford cared or would listen to me  I told the transmission mechanic to fix it quick to get it going  It cost me  1 000 to get rid of it  I traded it in for a Honda Civic and haven t had one problem with it in two years and my warranty has no deductible  I am currently looking for another SUV  My employer is currently advertising any Ford vehicle for purchase over 4  dealer invoice  Even with this incentive I will never purchase another Ford again  I can only recommend this vehicle if you have the money for all of the repairs or you buy an extended warranty without a deductible and trade it in before your warranty expires br br
