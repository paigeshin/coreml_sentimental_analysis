 Wednesday night  who goes out on a Wednesday night  There s this reggae party that happens at one of the beach front hotels in my area  Kind of a tradition for the locals  but I haven t been to it since 1995  Well  a bunch of my fianc s co workers talked him into going with them and of course  he wanted me to come  Because I usually don t get off work until 6PM ish  I knew we d have to leave as soon as I got home  Wow  almost 7 years and it hasn t changed much  Because it s a beach party that involves cheap alcohol  it can be pretty amusing  But something about sitting outside when it s like 800 degrees and the food selection is limited to picked though chicken wings  ripe cheese squares and crackers doesn t really make me want to drink  But some of the people are interesting to look at  like that little hippie looking guy with a camel toe and a belt buckle bigger than his head  Or how about that screaming lady who forgot a bra that the bouncers are escorting out  Hmm  have another beer  I m glad I didn t drink  because my fianc  friends did  What s scary is one of them owns a 2003 Expedition and felt he could drive it home  In short  I got to drive a 2003 Expedition  The Expedition  introduced as a 1997 model  is the 2nd flagship to Ford s high profit SUV line that lead Ford to introduce the Excursion  which is still struggling  So much so that Ford had to cut manufacturing in half about a year and a half ago  Like GM  Ford has a large selection in SUVs and SUV like trucks  But in a market flooded with costly SUVs constantly being shoved down consumers throats  consumers are now starting to choke on the high gas prices and cost of ownership  The success of the 2003 Expedition is very important for Ford and their recovery after last years 5 45 billion dollar profit loss  proving that not all consumers need 5500  lb  gas guzzlers  that is  unless you re a soccer mom  It looks like SUVs have taken over the reputation the minivan once had  One of the main selling points for the redesigned Expedition is it handles much better off road and is not as  soft  and GM s Tahoe Yukon line  I wanted to find out who the Expedition is really targeted to and how much it really improved over its predecessor B I Exterior   At first glance  I mistook it for the 2002 Explorer  the Expedition looks very identical to it with the same front grill  headlights  bumper trims and overall body shape  Maybe this helped Ford save money on the redesign  I m wondering why they look so identical when the previous models of the Explorer and Expedition looked nothing alike  I think some consumers are still weary about the Explorer after the whole Firestone mess  so maybe this wasn t a smart design move  The Expedition is 205 8 inches or 17 15 feet long  78 7 inches or 6 5 feet wide  77 6 or 6 46 feet tall  It has a ground clearance of 8 9 inches and weighs in somewhere around 5 600 lbs  depending on the engine and if it s 2WD or 4WD  Color options for the Eddie Bauer Edition include white  dark green  black  light green  red and dark blue  There is no silver option yet and I prefer silver  but that s just me  But  you d think it would be an option because it s a basic color  Color options for the XLT model include a plain beige  tan  dark green  black  dark gray  light green  red  blue  while  silver and light blue  All are plain  everyday colors  but I suppose it would look a little funny in bright yellow  aqua or even the iridescent blue Honda offers  But I would still like to see some metallic orange tones and maybe a dark plum purple b CON b  Overall  the looks are bland  lacking the ability to turn heads  but clean  The Expedition does sport a lot of black plastic on the exterior  like many new SUV Trucks  depending on what trim options you get  I m not really fond of that because it s a maintenance pain  requiring regular polishing so it does not turn white in the sun  I used to gripe about polishing the front and back bumpers on my old Tercel  it took a lot of elbow grease get the plastic to absorb the polish and it was time consuming  The Expedition has a lot more plastic than my old Tercel  I recommend getting it professionally detailed every 6 months to keep up the plastic  but that can cost around  200 for a vehicle that size each time    Interior   It s hard to say what people like in interiors  everyone seems to want something different  Some look for leather  polished wood and a dial clock  I ve never figured that out  while others may want a unique layout with cool upholstery design  colored gauges and lots of light up goodies  But I think most want the interior to feel like a home away from home  whether it s conservative or bold  But it s not quite as easy to customize your car interior as it is your home  I think Ford tried to please everyone with the Expeditions interior  but did it with as little statement as possible and no real  boldness  and seemingly sucking the  sport  out of sport utility vehicle  I say this because it s a little on the bland side  according to Ford s site and the one I drove  there is only one color option for the interior  so far  It s tan  or light beige  with a tan and black plastic like dashboard  Because the dash is so big  there is a lot of negative space on it with no controls or vents  making it seem like an ocean of plastic  I would prefer more storage cubbies instead of wasted space  There s a large gap between the climate control panel and the stereo of just black plastic  The steering wheel is beige  but the background is black creating a strange mismatched feeling  The power controls are located on the door armrest area and were easy to reach  but did not get in the way  The captains chair for the drivers seat is nice  offering an armrest on either side  The leather is comfortable  but gets very hot in the sun  may want to consider a seat cover for the summer  The gauges are standard black background with back light  Again  this is bland  old styling  It would be nice if they used a white background instead  like the Escape or even get a little crazy with the new metallic tones  such as the Matrix Vibe duo  The climate control vents are large and round and the AC seems to cool down the cabin fairly quick considering the size  Both the 2nd and 3rd row of seats fold down  creating 110 cubic feet of storage    CON b  But  the seats only fold down  they can t come out  so they re still there taking up space  Most minivans have an advantage in that aspect because both rows of seats can be removed creating more storage space  The storage space isn t bad  but not good compared to many minivans  The Toyota Sienna has 133 4 cubic feet  the Honda Odyssey has 146 1 cubic feet and finally the Kia Sedona has 127 5 cubic feet of storage with the seats removed  all more than the large Expedition  The Expedition only has 20 7 cubic feet of storage behind the 3rd row of seats  while the Sienna has 26 6 cubic feet  the Odyssey has 38 1 cubic feet and the Sedona has 21 8 cubic feet  again susprisingly more than the Expedition For head room  the Expedition has 39 7 inches of headroom for the front row  39 8 inches for the 2nd row and 38 2 for the 3rd  while the Honda Odyssey has more with 41 2 inches for the first row  40 0 for the 2nd and 38 9 for the 3rd  In fact  even the new small to mid sized Honda Pilot SUV has more head room than the Expedition at 41 9 inches for the 1st row  40 9 inches for the 2nd row and 38 9 inches for the 3rd  If you re interested in the Expedition for space and cargo capacity  looks like a minivan would be the better choice An optional feature is the 3rd row of seats can powered down by using switch in the back reached when the back is opened up  I m not sure that s really helpful and I wonder how that can go wrong in the future  I would rather the seats be removable to open more space  than powered down B I Engines   There are two V8 engine options for the 2003 Expedition  The first is the standard SOHC 2 Valve  4 6 liter V8 with 232 hp and 291 lbs  of torque at 3 450 rpm  Though it sounds powerful  sadly  it does not seem to carry the Expedition s weight well  The Chevy Avalanche comes with a 285 hp engine that gets about the same gas mileage as this engine and it didn t seem much better  Depending on 4WD  the gas mileage on this model varies from 14 19 to 14 18  However  you may not get this mileage right away  I have read from other Ford owners that there seems to be a break in time of lower gas mileage for the first few months The 2nd engine is the optional SOHC 2 Valve  5 4 liter V8 with 260 hp and 350 lbs  of torque at 2 500 rpm  This is an improvement  but the gas mileage is between 13 18 to 13 17 depending on 4WD  This engine can tow up to 8 900 lbs  The gas tank capacity is 28 gallons  giving you 394 miles to 532 miles to a tank  depending on engine type and city of highway driving and can cost between  45 to  60 or more to fill up the tank  depending on gas prices in your area b CON b  The gas mileage is a major gripe about the Expedition  no improvements here  I realize something of this size needs power  but it s insulting when a V6 minivan that gets about 25 MPG can hold as much or more than the 2003 Expedition  About 3 years ago  Ford was making noises about a hybrid 200 hp V6 engine that gets around 40 MPG and possibly a V8 version with the new hybrid technology  When it was first mentioned in 2000  I think  the targeted release date was in 2003  But that seems to have faded  possibly due to profit loss  But if Ford can produce a mainstream SUV with a hybrid engine  I think it would give them the market edge they need to recover the lost profit and change the standards for SUVs  But  I guess that technology is beyond Ford at this point and we ll have to leave it to the Japanese to introduce the first US hybrid SUV  Ford can comply with car standards and have the new Expedition can achieve mileage of 17 22 or higher  but Ford choose to keep the Expedition in the old  utility  class  where the gas mileage requirements are lower  they save money on manufacturing and the consumer pays more for gas  Most consumers buying this model will not be using it for utility  but more as a minivan commuter car  In that aspect  someone needs to tell Ford we re moving forward not backwards in technology B I Handling   Handling is one of the major improvements in the next generation Expedition and I will say it s quite an improvement  Road noise and wind shear seem to be non existent  It s a quiet ride  unless you have the stereo cranked  But it was almost too quiet  I found myself getting sleepy  maybe boredom played a role in this as well The power steering was very easy and somewhat responsive and the brakes seem to work well  But don t take that for granted  something of this size and weight has a lot longer stopping distance than a car  I don t recommend tailgating anybody in this because you may not have enough time to stop if they slam on the brakes  The overall handling was a little mushy because it felt like the body was reluctant to turn with the wheel  making tight turns a challenge  It has independent front and rear suspension  While I did not get to take it off roading  I would imagine it would do well B I Standard Features   b PROS b  Standard features include Keyless entry pad and remote keyless entry  4 wheel disc brakes with ABS  child safety seat anchors  dual front airbags  leather seats  Eddie Bauer  power steering  low profile roof rack  17  wheels  40 60 bench seats in the first row  XLT only  captains chairs standard on Eddie Bauer  3rd row bench seats  tilt steering column  cruise control  CD cassette stereo  power windows  power locks and dome light B I Optional Features   An optional feature that proves the Expeditions minivan likeness is DVD rear seat entertainment center  It offers 7  screen that folds down from the ceiling and a control panel with headphone jacks  A interesting feature  but I m sure parents will agree that if this kind of entertainment is needed  a Gameboy or two is much cheaper and portable Other optional features include Safe canopy system  tire pressure sensing  power fold down 3rd seat  climate controlled front seats  Eddie Bauer only  4WD  2nd row captains chairs  power fold 3rd row seats  front hooks with 4WD only and moonroof B I Safety   One safety concern about SUVs  minivans and any vehicle with open storage area in the cabin is in the event of a bad accident  any large items in the cabin  such as a cooler  groceries  supplies for a beach trip or a sheet of wood  can hit passengers and cause injuries or worse  So if your in the habit of driving with a lot of stuff in the car all the time  you may want to rethink that or look into putting some kind of wall or separating barrier between it and the cabin that s strong and will not come loose easily  One thing mentioned in the ads is a Safe Canopy System with roll over sensor  What the heck is that  Well  it s an optional safety feature that s basically a wall of side airbags lining the 1st and 2nd row of seats  The roll over sensor allows the airbags to stay inflated it the vehicle is rolling and will deflate when it stops rolling  I can t decide if this is comforting or scary with all the roll over controversy around SUVs  but I did chuckle a little at the irony  if I were a better comedian  I could base a whole routine of this alone    CON b  This system does not cover the 3rd row of seats  kind of cheesy  If you re going to advertise such a complex safety system for a so called large family vehicle  make sure it protects all passengers  The 2002 model did very well in the government crash test ratings  however  the close relative  the F 150 did horribly in the IIHS tests  Because this is so new  it s too soon to get crash test ratings on it  I would assume Ford would only improve from the 2002 model    Warranty   The 2003 Expedition has a 3 year  36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty  5 year  50 000 warranty on the safety restraint system and a 5 year 100 000 mile power train warranty B I Resale   Like a minivan  I think most people buy a vehicle like this hoping they won t have to drive it for a long time  maybe just until the kids grow up or until the boat phase is over  Mainly because it s expensive  uses a lot of gas  is a pain to wash and not the most exciting thing to drive  So it s important that a vehicle of this price range holds a high resale value  Being a new  redesigned model  that can be a gamble  especially with possible gas problems in the future  I recommend taking a look at reviews of older Expeditions from owners and look at what used Expeditions are selling for  You

run of the mill SUV  The looks are nothing to get excited about  power is mediocre  while gas mileage is poor and space seating capacity are average  While it does have a promise of improved safety and improvements in handling and suspension for off roading uses  the  32 000 to  42 000 price tag and yuppie soccer mom feel may not appeal to the class that will go off roading  Overall  the 2003 Expedition is a nice vehicle  in terms of some what luxury with refined off road handling  But I did not find it  fun  to drive  When I say fun  I mean something that handles with a little spirit  is easy to drive and park  and a little different  unique in some aspects from other vehicles in it s class  Like the looks of the Toyota Matrix Pontiac Vibe  or the above average power and gas efficiency of the Nissan Sentra Spec V  or even the new hybrid technology and looks of the Toyota Prius  But I did not find any of these qualities in the 2003 Expedition  I like something I can look forward to driving every morning  but I think I would look forward to the Expedition about as much as I would to a bowl of bran cereal with skim milk  There is nothing  special  about it and I can see where it can be classified with the  tan minivan  in terms of excitement  Even though it has more luxury qualities  it by no means has the reputation or demands the attention that one would get driving a luxury sedan  such as a Lexus or an Acura that I think luxury buyers are looking for  Nor is it as fun to drive because it s more sluggish and the handling is mushy  I don t think luxury buyers want to be mistaken for a dreaded soccer mom  even if they are taking their kids to soccer practice  It gets a 2 star rating As stated in my Avalanche review  my major complaint goes something like this  The newest Expedition is another Ford contribution to the SUV Truck power craze that has brought dreams of big bucks to the big Detroit three and I must say I m not impressed  As an answer to the now outdated SUV craze  we are starting to see a lot of these over powered utility vehicles that are being shoved down consumers throats with high price tags through extreme advertising  The problem  By using loopholes in the emissions standards  American and other auto manufacturers make more profit by selling vehicles  such as SUVs and SUV like trucks  classified as  utility  vehicles  designed for utility  not for commuting or everyday uses  Problem is they re being advertised and sold as everyday use cars  The Reason  Selling a utility vehicle is cheaper for a manufacturer is because there is 33  mileage and emission standards required  However  consumers are the ones reamed with the extra fuel costs  but the manufacturers are saving money and that s what s important  right  These loopholes have allowed American manufacturers to become dependant on the profit from selling more utility vehicles than cars  A good example of this is Ford s latest advertising campaign with Bill Ford talking  I ve only seen two versions of these commercials  for trucks and for SUVs  just their  utility  vehicles  Not for efficient family sedans or compact cars  because Ford does not make a lot of profit on those  I wouldn t have a problem with large trucks and large SUVs if they had more efficient engines and better safety ratings  It just seems that the consumers and the environment are the losers in this greedy game of profit  Pardon my instantaneous rage  I just read a disturbing article on how America s gas consumption and emissions pollution has nearly tripled since 1985 because of the SUV boom and what the government is not doing about it  I like American vehicles as much as the next American  but it seems that the Detroit three are shooting themselves in the foot by manufacturing all these trucks and SUVs we don t need with old standards when gas prices are going up  the environment is becoming more of a concern and there is a big oil controversy on whether or not to drill in Alaska  If the standards were tighter and they did not use the loopholes to manufacturer  America would never need to drill in Alaska and gas prices would probably be cheaper now  Agree  Don t agree  The comment section is open  6 25 02   I came across this article that s rather disturbing today http www thecarconnection com index asp article 5020 Other vehicles to consider Honda Odyssey   Has more styling looks  more versatile space  better gas mileage  great crash test ratings  will seat 7  is cheaper and can even tow up to 3 500 lbs Ford Focus Wagon   Has lots of cargo space  head room  good looks  good gas mileage  American brand  is cheaper and comfortably seats 5 Honda Pilot   Cheaper  smaller  better gas mileage  seats 8  tows up to 4 500 lbs  and has more head room Thanks for reading
