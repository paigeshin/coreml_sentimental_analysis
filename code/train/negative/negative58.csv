 Could things get any worse I loved how it looked  after that it was all down hill  Besides the neat oval theme there is nothing about this car I liked  First problem was a short in the steering column  ever time you turn right the radio would shut off  Then as I drove home from a long vacation  at night  made a right hand turn and the headlights shorted out   We ended up sleeping at a rest stop until the sun came up and comfort is not included with the oval theme  Then I had problems with the tranny slipping and when you put it in reverse none of the electrical worked  And to think this all happened before I could make my first loan payment br br
