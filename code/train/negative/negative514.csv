 Well  my landscaping saga continues as I venture to get stonewall siding and this time I got to borrow a  2003 Ford Excursion  to get the siding  You would have thought I would have learned not to do this after my less than impressive trip with a GMC Yukon Denali I borrowed  But I figured another great review chance and I wanted to see if this vehicle is a great as many owners hype it up to be  One of my co workers is a mother of 3 older kids and their Explorer and king cab Dodge truck just wasn t enough space for the kids and crap they usually lug along  Before they bought an Excursion  we were talking one day about what their next vehicle would be when the lease runs out on the Dodge and how she wanted more space  I told her to consider the Honda Odyssey  Toyota Sienna or even a Kia Sedona because they a lot of room and seemed to fit her needs  She says   No way  I can t drive a minivan  I m not the minivan type  They re ugly  However  what they brought home was much uglier  I thought her views were a little uh off considering they don t tow anything and never go off road  but thought an Excursion would be better than a minivan  Well  it certainly costs more  Problem is  they re die hard Ford fans  i i  and there s not much in the minivan or car selection from them now  Matter of fact  it s predicted that by 2005  Ford will only sell trucks and SUVs  i okay  not really  but this wouldn t surprise me  I decided to check it out when borrowing the Excursion for another landscaping mission  hoping I would not come to the same conclusion as with the Denali  And that is that for these type of trips  picking it up yourself can be more time  work and money than simply paying to have it delivered  So  another half of a Saturday down the drain  but with a better insight on the Excursion  The Excursion was introduced in 2000 and sales have been suffering since  so much so that Ford had to cut production in half in 2001 b i Performance  Power and Handling   This model has the  6 8L V10 with 310 HP   but you can also get a  5 4L V8 with 255 HP or 7 3L V8 Diesel with 250 HP   For a V10  I was not impressed with the power  maybe I was expecting too much  It was able to move  but acceleration was minimal and not exciting  don t expect much when passing on the highway  this engine is designed to pull a lot of weight  but not fast  It can  tow up to 11 000 lbs b  with the V10  but despite the Dumbo like side view mirrors  this elephant would not fly  I think the major problem is it weighs in at about 7 200 lbs  by itself  not including passengers or cargo  using a lot of power to move itself  The Excursion has a  44 gallon gas tank and recommends a minimum of 87 octane fuel   I had to put 32 gallons into it before returning it  costing me  49 60  to fill it from empty to full would cost about  68 20 at current prices in my area  This angered me because the delivery service from the landscaping place would have been cheaper  not to mention less time consuming  Depending on the engine  the gas mileage ranges from  7 10 MPG to 11 15 MPG   Problem is the low gas mileage has earned this model a spot on  The Meanest Vehicles for the Environment  for 2002 list  which can be viewed at www greenercars com  It will most likely make the list again for 2003 and may not be good for the resale value  The Power Stroke Diesel V8 engine requires 1D or 2D diesel and achieves marginally better gas mileage than the other two options  many owners report around 17 MPG and a max of 24 MPG  Maneuverability is a big problem with the Excursion  for making U turns  I found it needed at least four lanes  It s also a challenge to park in smaller  single lane parking lots because of the large turning radius required  you will most likely be readjusting in reverse at least once  I would not recommend this for regular city driving With nothing in it  the ride was fairly smooth  not really noticing small bumps  However  larger bumps sent a sharp jolt through the Excursion and made the vehicle continued to sway afterwards  something I also noticed in the Denali  With the back end weighed down  I was noticing every bump in the road and feeling many clunks  making for a bumpy ride  I was a little disappointed by this  expecting something this size to handle smoother  There was also a significant amount of body roll on tighter turns  Shortly after getting in and taking off  I started to despise the visibility issues with the Excursion and found myself constantly leaning forward and twisting around to double check everything  getting a strange kink in my neck  It s hard to get used to the larger front end and how close it is to other objects  Looking through the review mirror  it s hard to see lower objects  The Excursion is about  6 4 to 6 7 ft  tall   depending on if it has 4WD or not and the added height makes seeing over traffic nice  like the Denali I drove  but I found lower visibility to be a problem making it hard to see lower objects  This model had the  optional reverse sensor  that beeps when you get too anything close while backing up like a house  Parking the Excursion was a hideous nightmare  I m sure many people already figured this  The Excursion is about  19 ft  long and about 6 7 ft  wide   the average parking spot is only 18 ft  long  some less  No matter how you park  it will always be sticking out in the back and I was struggling to get it in as much as possible without hitting the car in front of it  the visibility issues weren t helping  it took 3 tries and a small portion of my sanity  Also  it s tricky to park next to other vehicles close to its size with those side mirrors that stick out so far  It s important when parking it to make sure it s centered in the spot to reduce the risk of it getting hit by the door of the car next to it  I found it was always close to the lot lines making something like this easy to happen b i Interior Looks and Features   Overall interior space on the Excursion is close to the Honda Odyssey at  146 4 cubic feet  behind the first row   100 7 cubic feet  behind the 2nd and  48 cubic feet  behind the 3rd  The leather captains  chairs in the front were comfortable  but got really hot in the sun  The instrument cluster is nothing to get excited about  it s very plain and dated looking with white on black gauges  black plastic and a steering wheel that was a strange shade of brown  The controls were well laid out and easy to reach for the most part  but all in black plastic and a plain layout  Maybe that s the young  wild side of me talking  but I found the interior very plain and drab with lots of black buttons  know knobs  silver or wood accents  kind of generic looking  I did not like the all button climate control  it seemed awkward to use compared to the large knob based systems  I couldn t reach over and easily make adjustments while driving  The power lock and window switches were easy to reach and seemed well laid out  Power adjustable pedals for different sized drivers is an option this model had  This model had the optional DVD entertainment system for the 2nd and 3rd rows  but I didn t get a chance to play with it  Remote keyless entry is standard on all models The Excursion can hold up to 9 passengers if you get the 3 bench rows seating option  this one s body count was only at 8 with two captains chairs in the front and 2nd and 3rd rows being benches  It can be as low as even 7 with the 1st and 2nd captains chair option  The 3rd row seemed roomier than the Denali  but still lacked a little in leg room for my 6 ft  tall frame and my head was still close to the roof and could possibly hit on a big bump  Up front  there are four cup holders that would hold just about any size cup and they re easy to reach  There are two interior color options  gray and beige  this one had beige that looked nice and warm  I don t think I d like the gray too much in something this size  the interior would seem too barren  The 3rd row of seats is fairly easy to remove  just flip them forward and pull a bar at the rear to slide them back b i Exterior Looks and Features   The Excursion has the front of the Ford F 250 and up series  the front end of a work truck and it s not attractive  The front grille is larger and sticks up higher than the head lights  I think Ford got this design from Dodge shortly after the RAM series were redesigned with a similar grille  But  they did not improve it  the grille is big and blank looking with no crossbars  just the blue oval in the center  creating a lot of negative space on the front  The headlights are standard  no metallic effects or any hints of stylization  Also  the large side view mirrors stick out very far from the sides  making me think of Dumbo looking at the Excursion from the front end  The mirrors also made me nervous parking because of the extra width to the truck  From the side  the Excursion looks very boxy  it has no sexy lines or curves  just an enormous wall  Getting two tone paint helps this a little  but not much  The front side windows have a gap in the front that slopes down  maybe for better visibility but I did not find how this helped A sad thing about the one I borrowed  it had been keyed twice on the driver s side  The owners weren t very happy about it and they re still in the process of getting estimates to have it fixed  Fortunately  this happened before I borrowed it  I m not sure why it was keyed  but have some theories with the controversy around an SUV of this size  however I didn t think that was a problem in this area  Anyway  the exterior color of this one is Estate Green  only available to Eddie Bauer editions  I have to say it was not attractive  a light flat pea green that looks like it came from the 70 s  anyone that has ever had a baby throw up on them is probably very familiar with this color  I guess I was not the only one that thought this because while getting ready to back out in the parking lot of Home Depot  two guys walking behind it made puking sound affects  Other color options include aspen green  hunter green with yellow hints  black  mineral gray  flat silver  white  red  true blue  light navy  and wedgewood blue  lighter blue The ground clearance is 8 1 inches  but it seemed a lot higher to me while loading the back  maybe even higher than the Denali  making it harder to load heavy objects  I realize the back opens up in 3 parts because of the size  but I still hate it  To open the back  first the window has to be flipped up  then the lower tailgate is in two doors that swing out on either side  Again  making it less convenient to load things quick  You can just lift the glass to load objects  but the height almost forces you to heave them in over the tailgate    Safety   The Excursion comes with 2 front airbags and 3 point safety seat belts  no safe canopy system like the Expedition  but it does have side impact beams  Reading other reviews  it seems everyone mentions safety as being a pro for the Excursion  but I can t find safety ratings for the 2000  2001  2002 or the 2003 model  not on NHTSA or IIHS  The Excursion is based of the F 250 truck and I can t find crash test ratings for it either  Also  there s no rollover information on it  So I can t say weather this is a safe vehicle or not  the only thing I know this model has going for it is weight b i Parting Shots   Pricing on the Excursion ranges from   35 500 up to  49 900   I m young and don t have a family  so I don t need to worry about a lot of passengers  But  growing up in a large family  I can understand why having a bigger vehicle is nice  I remember we had a large Dodge van that only came out of the side yard for family trips and or towing the boat  my parents used their smaller cars for commuting to work and short trips  After having experience with a couple of large SUVs over the past weeks  I can understand why my parents did not want to drive the large van all the time  It s just not fun to be stuck driving something this size all the time  I felt that way about the Excursion  It s big  can tow and has space  but it was not relaxing or exhilarating to drive because parking was a nightmare  forget parallel parking  visibility issues were stressful and it needs at least four lanes to make a U turn  which isn t always available  adding to the stress  Get up and go power is just not there  even with the V10  making for a sluggish ride  Also  I can see where loading kids might not be as easy as a van or a minivan because of the added height and the extra work to get to the 3rd row of seats and interior space is only slightly better that a minivan  very slightly  However  the higher ground clearance can make this space less convenient to use  This is a utility vehicle with a lot of towing power  but pricey for something used for occasional uses and pricey to drive all the time  I would only recommend it for people towing all the time  like for maybe a horse business of some sort or landscaping business  Off roading is not a big strength of this model because of the size  long wheel base and weight  I believe the Kia Sorento ad pokes fun at this  I don t know how it would handle in snow  because we just don t see that in Florida  but from what I read  having 4WD or AWD is good  but having a heavy vehicle  like the Excursion  is not always good  Something to look into and consider before buying if you live in a snowy area  The reason I give this model such a low rating is because it has such a limited targeted audience  very expensive for a truck that may not be used on a regular basis  has terrible gas mileage  worse than many in it s class  except the diesel model  and is not fun to drive  If you need a truck for towing  I would recommend looking for a good deal on one used to have around when you need it  If you need convenient space  look into a minivan that has equal room and is easier to drive  cheaper and gets better gas mileage  If 4WD is your primary need  maybe for snowy weather  look into a smaller  more nimble SUV  truck or sport wagon  again  you ll save money and have more fun driving it  The Excursion tried to combine all these uses in a big  expensive package with mediocre  less efficient and less usable results  This is essentially an F 250 truck without the rugged bed and only major strengths are towing  towing and  uh  towing  Did I mention towing  But  keep in mind  many minivans and smaller SUVs can tow  usually between 3 000 to 4 500 lbs  enough to accommodate many boats and trailers  The Excursion seems to be targeted to the larger loads and more industrial business uses hence the narrow targeted audience  But hey  if you paint it yellow with black stripes down the side  maybe the county will help pay you to drive it
