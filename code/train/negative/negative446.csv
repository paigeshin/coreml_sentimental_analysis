 I had a  95 Hyundai 5 speed and wanted to step up  What I really wanted was a  99 Cougar but the salesman was just too much of an idiot to deal with a women buying a car  So I went to another dealer  and he treated me well and I bought the exact same car that is in the picture above  Love that red car  The engine and drive train are great  The rest of car is the problem  The whole driver side of my car is incorrectly installed  From the dashboard to the door to the outside trim to the interior window molding  I have had them rip out my dashboard to find a rattle  they can t find it but we all can hear it  They have replaced my hand brake  They have replace the rear window and molding  And unfortunately  it is slightly better than when it went into the dealer  There are now stains on my seats  tools left inside  my manual is now under the hand brake console  On the up side  it is a guy magnet br br
