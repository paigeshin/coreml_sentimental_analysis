 I rented a Ford Explorer 2000 for 3 days and was unimpressed  This was an 8 cylinder and had less than 1K miles on it  The gas mileage must have been around 14 15  The first thing I noticed in the rental parking lot was the Firestone tires on the vehicle  The car seemed stiff to me in handling  The steering is tight and any small movement will cause the car to pull appreciably  So  it is easy to see how one could turn one of these over with a sudden yank on the steering wheel The interior was nicely designed  but the leg room was inadequate  I am only 5 5 quot  and found that I could not put the seat back far enough for my comfort  Also  I found that after a while  the seat felt uncomfortable  There were four different buttons for seat positioning  but two seemed to have the same function The interior was great for cargo space but there seemed to be even less leg room for the back seat area  This vehicle was hard to get in and out of because of the wheel height  Even using the running board  it was not easy to get into  I had to pull myself up into it The visibility is good since you are sitting higher than most other vehicles on the road  There are many settings and features on the radio and this one came with a very good quality cd player  The quality of the sound was good The locking mechanism was on a fob key holder and it worked well  Although I thought that they could have increased the sound to better hear the locking mechanisms for safety sake The power was okay   this one was an 8 cylinder   not impressive and not a real powerhouse  despite the mileage  or lack thereof I doubt that I would ever own one of these Explorers  I currently own a Jeep Grand Cherokee and have been a Jeep owner for over ten years  So  perhaps my bias is showing br br
