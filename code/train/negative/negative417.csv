  Introduction  Man  I can t believe I m doing this  I m breaking my own rule  I m updating and reposting the article  Why am I doing this  Because my opinion of this truck has completely changed  It has transferred its weight from my love it list  to my hate it list  all in one day This truck is the SuperCab  4 6 Liter  Automatic  4x4  XL with add ons  Flare side pickup b Pros  Not many The airconditioner is cold  Very cold  I love the airconditioner The cupholders are great  Easily holding anything up to huge drinks confidently The radio sounds great and I love the controls  easy to reach from the driver seat The paint is still beautiful  even after 162 000 miles not on the same engine It is very roomy  you could easily seat six in the interior You are sitting very high in the truck  command of the road is there  you feel powerful but you aren t We haven t put any transmissions in it  lack of power from the engine is why  I m guessing The doors are cool when you need to unlock them  pull up on the handle and they are unlocked  The single key is also nice b Neutral  A third door is great  albeit on the passenger side  when it would be really helpful on the drivers side One gas tank is enough right  I expect two in Ford trucks  Especially with this gas mileage b Cons  Bear with me  this is going to take a while The engine that I thought was the original wasn t  original replaced at 80 000 miles  died at 159 000 miles  It was gutless then  I forgave it  assuming that it was tired from 159 000 miles of service  The new engine is worthless  4 6 liters of gas guzzling worthless junk  Zero to sixty was measured not professionally  to be 18 or 19 seconds  Towing has to be less than 4 000 lbs Gas mileage is always nice  this truck doesn t get it  It gets gas footage  It gets 67 584 feet per gallon  Or more commonly referred to as 12 8 mpg  In a tiny V8  This was with AC on not max  on the highway  with overdrive on  This was my low  average is about 15  with a maximum of 17 once  25 mph for two hours because of hazardous road conditions The bench seat in the front is stupid  I hate it  It moves with the driver  so if the driver is short  the passenger better hope  s he is too  The rear seat is no better  very cramped The seat in this truck is ridiculous  Lack of lumbar always leaves me with a back ache  There is no padding which leaves my backside sore  and the headrest pushed your head forward The cruise control freaked out on me  I pushed resume  assuming it would reach 65 mph assigned  it looked down to the surprise of 80 mph and climbing  Sometimes it won t work at all The radio has the curious gremlin of not shutting off sometimes  It will continue to be on  although the button is in Styling has to be the worst  It looks like its trying to be aerodynamic  but at the same time appears as if it is going to fall on its nose This truck will not hold an allignment  After the first one wore off  we replaced ball joints  steering items among other things  It has been alligned three times in the last year and was out of allignment yesterday b Overall  This truck downright sucks  The engine sucks  the gas mileage sucks  the little things drive me crazy I do not recommend this truck  Look elsewhere br br
