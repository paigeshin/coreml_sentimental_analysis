 You may think that a new design will improve the previous design not necessary with 2001 Explorer  The only change is the head and tail light I went to the dealer with a very positive attitude to test drive the new Explorer  Was I impressed when I left  not at all  the same opinion as last model The ride is very bumpy  it feels like sitting on wood  The engine sounds like a tractor trailer and cornering is a disaster  I felt very unsafe driving without the seat belt because I was sliding all over the place Front seats are so so  but rear seats are very uncomfortable  You ll think that after all the complaints that people made about seat comfort that Ford will make some improvement  but unfortunatlly they did not and 2001 model is the same as previous except for little minor changes Ford Explorer does not have the car like ride as Nissan Pathfinder  Toyota 4Runner or Grand cherokee  It has very rough bumpy ride Does it really worth  30 000  please think again br br
