 I own a Ford Econoline E150 1998 model conversion van  I like the quality of the van as well as all the convenient features such as cruise  cassette  air  ABS  etc  However  I was surprise to discover after I purchased the van that one safety feature is missing  That is the Door Ajar warning is not included as standard  So  there is absolute no warning if one of the doors is not shut tight  I can not believe the van with all the standard features does not have this important and basic feature  So to the prospective buyers of this van  make sure you check that feature and ask for it when you buy it br br
