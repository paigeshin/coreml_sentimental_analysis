 Why oh why do people continually by the Ford Mustang  The answer is because they are cheap and some people think that they look cool  The Mustang is a car that formerly had a proud heritage and used to stand toe to toe with the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird  Now  decades later  the only car the base level V 6 powered Mustang can beat is the Honda Accord  The fact that Ford  quot upped quot  the power output in the current generation Mustang V 8s just goes to show that Mustang owners everywhere were getting trounced at red lights by the GM faithful in their Camaros and Firebirds  Is this not humiliating to a Mustang owner  Can the Mustang loyalists hold their heads up proudly knowing that there are a plethora of more superior vehicles out there  The answer      yes they can  In the past the Mustang was am amazing car and it single handedly defined the  quot muscle car quot  genre  but the same cannot be said for the Mustang of today  If I wanted a mid sized car that was reasonably quick and rather sporty looking  I would opt for an Accord coupe  Then at least I would know that my car would outlive me br br
