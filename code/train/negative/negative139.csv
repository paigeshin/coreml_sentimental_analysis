 My 2000 Ranger is my first Ford product in 12 years  My initial reaction to this vehicle  The quality of their products has remained the same or dropped in that time period vs  the expected improvement As a truck  my expectations were somewhat different vs  a passenger car  particularly in areas of ride and cab comfort  Generally  I was pleasantly surprised in both areas  However  the overall quality level of the truck quickly eroded any positive feelings for the vehicle Some of the quality problems were superficial or cosmetic   incorrectly cut carpeting  exposed wiring  radio knobs that have no start stop points  Not show stoppers  but enough to leave you uneasy about things you don t see or use on a regular basis Other quality issues were more problematic  The truck was delivered with loose front wheel bearings and was badly out of alignment   to the point of ruining the front tires within 800 miles due to cupping I have experienced  severe vibration in power steering assembly that it intermittent irregular idle and loss of power when clutch is disengaged air conditioning that fails to discharge evaporated water correctly  causing mildew in the evaporator box that must be flushed and deodorized on a regular basis  These are problems that I would expect to encounter at 80 000 miles  not at 800 miles As a daily driver  the truck is a mixed bag  Gas mileage has been disappointing   18 in town  20 on highway vs 22 27 rating  The ride is better than expected   somewhat choppy  but acceptable for a truck  especially with a short wheelbase On the positive side  the standard bench seats are comfortable and come with a 60 40 split  Legroom and headroom is adequate for a 6 0 person  The standard stereo system has a built in cd player and delivers better than average sound quality  The heater delivers more than adequate heat  but does suffer from A C odor problems  Dash board control and gauges are easy to read and provide more than standard idiot lights  A tach would be helpful with standard transmission models  especially to monitor idle levels This truck initially caught my eye due to its sticker price  which seemed very reasonable  Unfortunately  low price does not always mean value  and in this case  it didn t br br
