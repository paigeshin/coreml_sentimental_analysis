 Dear  Reader  I regret to inform you that Ford motor company has the worst minivans in the world  I bought a 1995 Ford windstar and since 4 months after I bought it Air Conditioner problems arrive  A faulty clutch in the A C didn t allow the A C to run so my engine will keep every 2 minutes going up and down in the RPM  Not to mention my major overheating during a 2 mile trip to church  During that trip I got so mad that I went to church and drove back home with a white smoked cloud and the temp gauge in the H  At the end a head gasket problem  water pump  and a Catalytic Converter full of  Antifreeze Coolant  try to beat that one  My tires lack of pressure all the time and aligment is done every 4 000 miles  Fuel economy is actually called Fuel Waste  13Mpg in my Windstar  The bench are 150lb each and the rear vent windows don t open anymore  My plastic headlights cover turn in to a crack yellow color and the windshield washer work when it wasn t to  I am waiting to finish paying for it so I could just put it in front of a railroad track and see it blow  Probably with the 5star rating on accident I will need to put it two or tree times on the tracks  I almost forgot my sliding door don t close completely  If you look from the back you can see it slightly open  I don t even mention Ford recalls letter 17 in total
