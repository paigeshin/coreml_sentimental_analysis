 My husband and I leased a 1995 Ford Contour 4D  auto  with air  and power everything  We were pleased with it at first but slowly became disillusioned About a month after we bought it both cup holders were broken  which ever genius decided to put them between the front seats and made of such flimsy plastic ought to be fired  Then the drivers seat broke you couldn t move it forward or backward come to find out the seats had been recalled so they replaced it free of charge   took them almost a month to do it  Then the blower for the heater air would only blow on low kind of cold to ride in in the middle of the winter in New Hampshire  Cost to repair  350 which it stopped working again in about 3 months  Lastly the engine light would come on and off and we took it to Ford they said a wire was loose causing this to happen  Well one day just driving down the road in 1997 the car just stopped running  After all was said and done the engine had seized  No one to this day has been able to explain this to us since it had oil in it was a well maintained car  Cost to repair  3 000  We left the car at the dealership and haven t seen it again I feel sorry for the next sucker to lease buy it br br
