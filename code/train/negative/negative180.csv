 My little sister owns a 1991 Ford Taurus  and I ve got to admit it really sucks  Now  I m not trying to cut down Ford Motor Company in any way  I just think they can build a better car  This particular Taurus has a 3 4 L V6 that barely has a downshift  and couldn t go fast if your life depended on it  and I m talking about when it was brand new  Now  it s even worse  The suspension is too rough  the transmission shifts too hard  and the over all quality of the interior is just  well  tacky  Not only is it too plain  but it reminds me of something you would see in a 1970 Volkswagon Van  Now  I have to admit  the stereo and sound system are pretty good because I installed them myself so I know  I asked her if I could take it around town for a little while and see what it sounds like and see if I can get anyone to look and try to see where the music is coming from  People did look  well that s beside the point  While driving her car  I realized that it is just a pile of scrap metal on wheels  I don t know what the newer model Ford Taurus handles like  but this one can t and won t perform  I believe I have told you enough of about the piece of mobile junk  so I ll quit taking up your time  Thank you  that is all MAC
