 The new mustangs dont really impress me that much  One of my best friends have one and i find it a pain in the butt to take people around in it  Dont get me wrong  the car looks allright bt inside unless you are in the fron seat you are going to be very unconfortable  The sound system in it sounds nice even without the subs he added  Hes got a 6 cylinder and it feals like its got alot of power but only 190 HP my truck can out run that but of coarse i have a standard  Having a CD player and a Tape was a good thing  It takes corners well and its ok on gas The mustangs have gone way down in price  i think that is why they are becoming a little more bland  When i was looking for a car i test drove a 98 GT and i was impressed wth everything except the size of the back seat  I will write a epinion on it too look for it The mustang carries a great name but they are turning int a 2 seater that really doesnt have the power that it used to  ever since they stopped makin the 5 0 engines in 94 Overall you get a car wth a small backseat  ok gas mileage  looks kinda nice  a name that every1 knows  sounds ok  It is great for my friend he is single and usually carries one friend  But only one friend  I would say get something with a little bigger back seat br br
