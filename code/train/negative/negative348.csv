 The Expedition is seen as Ford s response to the GMC Suburban  I must say that I prefer the Suburban to the Expedition which merely seems to be a larger version of the Explorer  The Suburban was the original oversized SUV and Ford tried to imitate it  I think that the Expedition is too big  Bigger isn t always better  For one thing  it is hard to drive the Expedition on narrow roads because it is so wide  You can t park in tight parking spots for the same reason  It isn t good for hauling things when it is full because there isn t enough trunk space  the seats are uncomfortable and cramped  and it is built poorly  I had neighbors who owned the Expedition and they had to take it to the shop quite frequently because of one problem or another  The gas mileage isn t that great either  That thing is a gas guzzler  The Expedition seems like a ploy to sell vehicles by riding the SUV craze  In my opinion  you would be better off avoiding it br br
