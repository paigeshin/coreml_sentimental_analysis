  The Product The 1990 Escort LX  the sporty version  is a four door with hatchback model that I have owned for the last year 1 2  I have driven approximately 2000 miles on it  This is due solely to the fact that there are parts missing from the transmission  I believe this is due to somewhat poor maintenance on the part of the previous owners and second due to that the transaxle on this model  down to the LX  is considered crap  Try auctioning for a 90 escort on ebay  If they list the cars faults  it ll be  busted transaxle  on there for sure The Experience I may be the only person alive that was excited to get an escort  I paid for it all by myself  cash  We were aware it had a  slow shift  but had no idea how long it was going to be before the car was a goner I ll tell you the exact expiration date  June 25th  2000  I was driving along on Kingston Pike in Knoxville  TN when I heard a fire engine  I glanced in my rearview mirror  and the guy in front of me  who I left  well  over two car lengths between  STOPS with SUCH SPEED  must be nice to have anti lock brakes a feature my escort didn t have  that I SLAM on my brakes and my brakes lock and I smash into him We patched up the car  We named her doo wop  as she had never bebopped in her entire 10year career as an automobile The car started having more trouble after we patched her up  The transmission fluid tube that runs from the resevior to the transaxle came off on the interstate and I had to exit with my lurching car to the nearest service station  The muffler fell off I bet it would have worked better if it were younger
