 Hey everybody  I don t own this car  I haven t ever driven this car  But I do have opinions about it  and I might as well share them My car is a Saturn SL1  go read my review  a car that is constantly subjected to being blinded at night by SUVs and trucks coming up behind us  This is an annoying problem  maybe one that Saturn should address  but still something of a concern  And I love trucks  I wanted a truck  before I got my car  and maybe someday I ll get one anyway  I m not in any way implying that there s any reason not to make trucks But the Excursion  named Big Truck by some of my friends  is simply too big  If you live where I live  you just don t need this vehicle  most likely  and you re endangering all of us by just driving it  I d like to know why half of the parents in my town bought their Excursions  whether it was for safety  or trendiness  or because minivans just aren t cool anymore  I d like to start a discussion about these mammoth SUVs so that they don t just keep getting bigger and bigger  so that eventually cars and trucks can be of compatible sizes and not create major problems for each other just by sharing a road The excursion is intimidating  and maybe that s what s appealing to some people  If one is near me on the highway  I want to get away from it  I do not believe they can see me  in my smaller car  and I don t want to get crushed  I ll do whatever I can to avoid an Excursion  and I m no meek flower of a driver  These cars are apt to roll over  can t stop quickly  and the blind spots are tremendous I have seen the most amazing sights concerning the Excursion  One day I was in a parkinglot behind one  and I sat mezermerized as big truck tried to fit into a rather wide space  It took more than seven adjustments  back out  pull in  back out  for Big Truck to park crookedly  and there was absolutely no room for me to squeeze by  Then  another day  in another parking lot  I saw a ten year old kid try to hop up into the passenger s side of the truck  He missed the seat and fell right onto the ground  I don t doubt that this happens all the time  I had a hard time not thinking about my tiny grandmother trying to get into this tremendous truck  A simple footstool  like the one she uses to get into our Plymouth Voyager  wouldn t be enough to even reach the Excursion s step  Big Truck is much too big Please  Excursion lovers  don t hunt me down to run me over with your truck  I m not trying to take away anyone s fun or anyone s vehicle  I just wish that people would think a lot harder before buying into the Excursion club  The power is appealing  the size is apalling  buying this truck makes you responsible for driving in a whole new way  If you need an Excursion  surely  go buy one  If you have to cart around ten people and a boat and luggage and some furniture all at once  by all means  get this truck  But please  keep in mind that not everyone on the road is in a Big Truck and that we have rights as well  Just don t buy this truck without a lot of heavy thought
