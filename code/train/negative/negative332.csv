 I m not a car person  I see a vehicle only as a means to get from point  quot A quot  to point  quot B quot  I don t know about cylinders or  quot x liter engines quot  or anything like that   I don t care  Never have  and probably never will  This is why  several years ago  I was looking at the Ford Escort  It s pretty low price  available in colors I wanted  and had a lot more power than the Honda Civic POS that had spitefully sputtered and died on me on a deserted highway several months before  I had everything worked out   I knew what color I wanted  and I had a down payment ready   I was ready to sign the papers and drive out of the lot in my brand new car  I was probably a little too eager to get a new car  as I had been riding the bus to and from work every day for three months or so  When I discovered that my insurance folks considered the Escort a  quot sports quot  vehicle  and wanted to charge me twice as much per month as the car payments would be  I was crushed  Bitterly  I returned to the car lot to see what else they offered The salesmen  who I m sure was almost as disappointed as I was for not making the sale  pointed me towards Ford s lowest level vehicle  The Aspire As I understand it  the Ford Aspire was only offered in  97  After seeing the vehicle  I could certainly understand why   the Aspire is an ugly vehicle  and I can t imagine how it could have sold enough models to warrant being offered again in  98  Imagine a more rounded Geo Metro       no  wait   imagine an egg  Yes  a giant egg that someone had the morbid sense of humor to fit with tires  skinny little things that are almost impossible to find replacements for when they go flat   I know this from personal experience twice over  It s a tiny car  but I was nevertheless amazed after opening up the hood by how incredibly  minute  the engine was  After spending too many hours groping around my old Honda s engine in the past  cursing every time I couldn t reach a vital bolt because of the cramped space  I sighed pathetically at the thought of trying to navigate around the even tinier engine of the Aspire  In fact  the only big thing about the car is the trunk space  Let me give you an idea how big it is   I m a drummer with a seven piece kit  I can fit the 22 quot  bass drum in the trunk without folding the seat down  and fill the rest of the car with the rest of my drums and hardware  and still drive quite comfortable  despite the fact that  even after two years  I m still a little embarrassed by my  quot Nanoo Nanoo quot  vehicle  After folding down the back seat  over half the space of the car becomes trunk space  Impressive  Another impressive aspect is the gas mileage   the Aspire s flagship feature  I suppose  It has a pathetically small gas tank  8 gallons  but that will take me about 250 miles  I often go 300 miles on a tank on road trips So  if you can get excited about pretty decent gas mileage and a lot of trunk space  and don t mind driving around in a giant chicken egg  go ahead and get this car   it s cheap  Otherwise  don t make the same mistake I made  Shop around and see what else you can get
