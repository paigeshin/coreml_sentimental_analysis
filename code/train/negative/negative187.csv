 I get a new Windstar LX as a company vehicle every year and I am disappointed by the lack of quality in this 2002 model  This is compared to previous Windstars  not to other makes and models  This van was made at the Oakville Ontario plant This is a minivan  not an expensive sports car  With that in mind here are my observations Ride  smooth and comfortable except for the out of round wheels and tires on this particular van making it vibrate at highway speeds  Handling  this is a minivan and it handles like one would expect it to  At high speeds  over 60  it doesn t like to go straight without constant steering corrections  At really high speeds  over 85  it can be tiring to drive as you are trying even harder to keep it in your lane  Maybe this is how all minivans are  I can only compare it to our Town Car which drives fine at ultralegal speeds Acceleration  quite good  This van has the 3 8 engine and has adequate power  The 2002 model doesn t seem to blast from 0 60 like the 2001 did  Maybe they changed the gear ratios  It s still pretty good though Transmission  not bad  Shifts smoothly and usually picks the right gear for the conditions  Much better than some other Fords I have driven although not as good as GM s I have driven  Brakes  seem fine to me  The pedal pressure is just right and the van seems to slow and stop just fine Noise  generally a pretty quiet vehicle  The engine makes quite a bit of noise at full bore as compared to other vehicles but it is noticeably quieter than the 1999 model I had several years ago  Interior  The front seats are great  I ve never used the back seats  one of them is in my garage unused  so I can t attest to their comfort  The kids haven t complained though  The back seats are the full width ones and are very heavy  One person can remove and install them if you want a backache so I always get someone to help me move the seats  I think other companies have done a better job at designing the seating on their vehicles Reliability  so far so good  Hasn t broken down yet  In previous years I have not had to do any repairs to my Windstars  just normal scheduled maintenance Quality  WHAT HAPPENED  This one has both front doors and the right sliding door and the rear hatch door all squeaking in unison as I drive down the road  Two wheels are out of round which causes vibrations at highway speeds making everything that isn t adjusted properly shake and squeak  I can see that the rear hatch door and the right sliding door are not adjusted properly and do not close tightly against the weatherstrip  The front suspension makes squeaking and grunting noises at low speeds  This is probably not a design flaw but an assembly goof  I would accept these flaws from a 10 year old vehicle with lots of miles on it but from a new vehicle  None of my previous Windstars were this poorly assembled  BTW  this is the first Windstar I ve had with the stamped  el cheapo wheels  the kind that need full wheelcovers on them  In previous years the wheels were the cast aluminum one piece  no wheelcover  wheels and they were fine
