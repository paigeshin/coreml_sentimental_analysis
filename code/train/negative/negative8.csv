 You ve probably heard about the giant 2000 Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle  which carries a significant price tag which relates to its size  According to safety experts  when you spot the Excursion on the road  pull off the asphalt after having wet your pants in fear and hide in the gutter to avoid any chance of making contact with a machine so big it feasts on coupes for snacks  and sedans for entrees  The Excursion isn t a utility vehicle meant to haul large families and large things that smaller vehicles can t  Only about 50 000 will be built the first year Excursion s strong point  its huge size  is also drawing criticism  It took a 310 horsepower V 10 to maneuver the 19 foot  Excursion over winding roads with minimal strain  Not sure if the base 5 4 liter  255 h p  would have fared as well  Ford estimates that the 5 4 liter will deliver 10 to 11 mpg city highway  the 6 8 liter 15 to 16 mpg  and the 7 3 liter turbo diesel 17 to 18 mpg With boat attached  the V 10 performed admirably  which  after all  is why Excursion exists  to provide those  who need to tow big  heavy things  a big  heavy vehicle  Once the boat was unhooked  the V 10 managed twisty  hilly roads without coming up for air  But even without a boat  Excursion isn t going to run from the light  The suspension has a tendency to be firm but has been adjusted to prevent bone jarring movement on uneven pavement  Handling is surprisingly pleasant  The steering offers  low effort movement  to balance out the size and weight without being so loose you don t feel in control  But don t expect to take a tight corner with ease as you would in say  an Explorer  And the turning radius is  well  let s just say you ll need three to four lanes for a U turn  Excursion comes with four wheel  anti lock  disk brakes  Even with normal braking  be sure to apply the pedal earlier to account for its size  There will be some who complain Excursion is too big  They probably will be the owners of tiny vehicles frightened by the Excursion  In my test drive  the Excursion never grabbed another vehicle and slung it from my path In back  the standard trailer hitch and associated hardware was designed to sit low to keep vehicles from submarining under Excursion in a rear end impact  Excursion is garageable  if the garage is at least 20 feet deep and the door at least 7 feet high  Inside  Excursion has three rows of seats to handle eight passengers  nine if you decide to go for a front bench seat rather than a massive center section with a writing top  4 cup holders for front and rear passengers  and enough room inside for tape CD coin holders plus the optional six CD changer  Entry to the third seat is easy  Press the handle and the second seat back lowers and the bottom slides forward for wide open entry exit in back  However  once in the third row  you are directly over the rear axle  putting you in touch with all the road harshness  Other features include a full size spare inside along the side wall that still allows a decent amount of room  and folding second and third seats increase cargo capacity  The third seat is on rollers so it can be removed or folded against the back of the second seat for more cargo room  and it contains tons of room behind the third seat for luggage or golf clubs without removing it  Other goodies include 10 cup holders  5 power plugs  4 coat hooks  second and third row reading lamps  rear cabin audio controls with dual headphone jacks  overhead console for garage door opener and eyeglass holders  Despite excellent glass hatch visibility  there s one glaring problem in back on Excursion  It stands so tall I lost sight of a BMW Z 3 that pulled up behind me at the light  which means objects such as pets or kids that are even smaller won t be seen when you back out of the driveway  Ford offers a sonar reverse sensing system on the Windstar mini van that beeps to warn of objects when backing up  It should already be here  but it will be offered on Excursion  hopefully  soon  If you have kids  you might want to wait for it  Dual air bags are standard with Belt Minder  which sounds a chime every 30 seconds as a reminder to buckle up  The Excursion is offered at a starting price of  33 460 for 2WD  and  36 775 for 4WD
