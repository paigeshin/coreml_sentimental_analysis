 We bought an  04 Eddie Bauer  hoping it would have the refinements to make owning a large SUV tolerable  Wrong  For a list price of  48 000  you re better off buying a fully tricked out Toyota Sequoia  and still have plenty of money left to take a family vacation  The Expedition interior materials and controls are of poor quality and feel cheap overall  including the  Special  Eddie Bauer leather and carpeting  The 2nd row captains chairs are narrow  cheap  and shallow  The 2nd row leg room is no better than that of our Acura MDX  Which is generous for a mid size  but not for a full size SUV  The storage in the cabin is limited with very narrow door pockets  no sunglass holder  nor a two tiered console storage system  And if you get an aftermarket rear entertainment system  they put the play unit in the console  which already houses the multi CD changer  which is out dated  requiring you to load into a multi cassette instead of directly into the dashboard unit  very hard to change CD s while on the move  taking up what little room you have to begin with  The vehicle is not outfitted to take on Satellite Radio either The ride is harsh  and not refined at all  The independent suspension does NOT make a difference on vehicle stability nor does it soften the ride  The handling is very heavy and the engine is very noisy when accelerating The navigation system is outdated  using multiple disks instead of one DVD for the whole country  the screen is tiny  and not letterbox  which is easier to read  The disks do not have the level of detail that you would expect with a multiple dvd system  In fact  the Acura Navi has more info on one dvd in letterbox format So why did we buy this vehicle  We needed space  plain and simple  On long road trips with our two boys and our dog  we wanted a substantial vehicle under our seats  The Escalade Extended was WAY too much money for not much value  and it s navi was outdated as well  The Navigator had less room and a poorly designed cabin  with the shift taking up needed room on the console  and no  loose  storage room  To get almost as much rear storage room in the Sequoia  you have to lift and remove their heavy  bulky third row seats  and then you are seatless when you get to your destination  The Expedition has a fold flat rear seat  which is comfortable for an adult  or two  or three  The Nissan Armada did not have the curb appeal  nor the interior space of the Expedition  and the large engine and drive train are in untested waters for Nissan  We ll wait for the Infinity version of that one  So that leaves the Yukon Denali XL  which was nearly as costly as the Cadillac  and the Suburban  which is  I m sorry to say  just a cheap Chevy We wish that Acura would make a bigger granddaddy to the MDX  which we feel is the best value in an SUV on the market
