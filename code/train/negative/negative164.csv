 This car is okay  but not at all what I had anticipated  I would classify it on the smaller end of mid size car  at least in the passenger seating area  Maybe because mine is a wagon they moved everything up to make the wagon end bigger  I don t know  But to fit 5 people in is very cramped Also  it is a V6 but lacks any ooomph in its acceleration  We bought this 96 vehicle in 98 with 30K miles and it only has 40K miles now but it already has problems starting on occasion  On the upside  I think it is a decent looking car for being a wagon and the rear seats fold down for more carrying area when needed  Mine has the third seat in back too which will come in handy down the road  For a smallish person like myself  the car is actually perfect   I get lost in a mig car anyway  It is just not the perfect family size vehicle we thought a stationwagon would be br br
