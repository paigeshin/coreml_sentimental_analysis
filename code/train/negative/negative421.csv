 I own a 97 F150 supercab V6 with automatic transmission  I now wish I had my old 5 speed Nissan back  If you go to the NTSB website you will see that Ford has more recalls than any other car maker  First  some credit  The truck looks and rides nicely  But that s where it stops  With the kind of money you put into a car these days  you expect value  I bought the truck for more roominess and a bigger payload  I bought it used in  99 with 33K on it  Since then  I have been mailed 3 recalls  one for fuel line leaks  one for a timing cover gasket leak  and one for a steering shaft possible breakage and accident  The truck developed a rattling noise that sounded like a loose exhaust part  it turned out to be both catalytic coverters  This cost me  550 to replace  During that time the check engine light had come on  Why  Because the head gasket on the right side had blown  97K miles  Had to replace that  and all 4   oxygen sensors  The catalytics failed because they were filled with coolant from the blown head gasket  Total   1200  Next  the alternator went out  100K miles  Then the oil pump went bad  nearlt ruined motor  Then the a c clutch bearings gave out and made the most horrible noise while driving  Replaced that  When this truck gives up  and it s close now at 150K because I think my head gasket is going again and catalytics are rattling again  I will strip what parts are still good and sell them off  then get a Nissan or Toyota  They may not be as pretty or have all the bells and whistles  but you can take one 200K or more and never have to replace anything major with proper care
