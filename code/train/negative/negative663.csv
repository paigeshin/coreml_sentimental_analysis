 Point by point I ll talk about the Ford Focus LX Sedan I bought a Ford because of my previous experience with the 1993 Ford Escort hatchback  Wonderful little vehicle  roomier than one might think  very fuel efficient with just enough power to get me onto the Interstate  it has a manual transmission with the 1 9 liter engine  A very low maintenance car and with over 110 000 miles I still drive it  I bought the Focus LX sedan  with the 2 0 liter SFI engine  because of this prior experience and because I was impressed with it s roominess and the layout if the dashboard  Also  I felt that it had a relatively smooth automatic transmission  And  viewed from the proper angle it looks nice  Took it for a test drive that should have been more rigorous and signed on the dotted line  Well  as I said  I should have really tested it  particularly up hills and not necessarily steep hills  This car  with this engine and transmission  has next to no power  I was aware of its sluggishness when accelerating  even on level ground but I was not prepared for it s utter reluctance to go up a hill  I dare say that if I had more than two people total in it I would be in the embarrassing position of stopping the car at the base of the hill and asking my passengers to get out and push I firmly believe that this engine and automatic transmission in this car body is a total mismatch and that Ford is a car company that either does not know what it is doing or feels that it can purvey anything it wants on the car buying public and too bad  once you sign on the dotted line it s yours and you deal with it  After only 5 000 miles I m already looking into trading it in for a Toyota or Honda  which I did not consider out of a misplaced sense of brand loyalty and  quot buy American quot  but for some strange reason American car companies still lag in designing engines that are fuel efficient yet have a little zip  And the Focus is not necessarily all that fuel efficient given it s lack of power  I am not impressed by the Focus s fit and finish either the rear fold down sets require a very hard push to get them to lock back into place  the front hood requires the same and some of the plastic moldings inside the car fall off  It is my opinion that American car companies still believe that they can push anything on the market  I get the impression that the Focus is a newly designed body with some old engine technology  This is not a knock on American manufactured cars but on American car companies  If they want to compete with the foreign car manufactures they should design and build cars that really do compete with them  Then I ll gladly turn my money over to them  But for now  it s Toyota or Honda I ll admit that on the highway the car handles like a larger car but that s part of the problem Ford built in a large car feel without approximating anything like a large car s power  As to who should buy this vehicle  Well  if you live in the Plain States and don t mind an unresponsive gas pedal  but very responsive brake pedal and don t have to deal with even moderately sloping hills than you are probably okay  On the other hand  if you live in the Pocono or Catskill mountains  not to mention the Rockies  or if you appreciate good highway acceleration forget about this car  I purchased the extended warranty for this car but I am about to ask for a prorated refund on it as I certainly do not intend on keeping this car for anywhere near the 75 000 miles that is covers  Shame on me for buying it  shame on Ford for making it Bob Hastings
