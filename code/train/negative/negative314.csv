 We bought our 1999 Windstar SE in August 1999  We looked at the Windstar  the Honda Odyssey  the Nissan Quest  and the Dodge Caravan  We decided on the Windstar even though we would have preferred the Odyssey  We didn t want to wait 3 months or pay over invoice  We ended up with a completely loaded woodland green SE model because at the end of the 1999 model year  the only SEL we could find was gold  The only option we didn t add was the backing up sensors  the beeping thing  This is basically an SEL without the two tone paint What we like We like the controls  They are very logically placed and if you have a large drink in the drink holder  it doesn t block the radio or other controls  the Quest was the worst for this We like the looks  It is a very nice looking van  in our opinion We love the dual remote controlled sliding doors  My two year old loves to play with the buttons  so for now  we have it turned off on the main control and I only use the remote for it right now  I m concerned too about safety  I stuck the large plastic key holder box at the dealership in the door as it closed and it dented it  I have VERY small hands and no way would I test it with my hand  Not worth the risk  The salesman did it though and the door opened back up It is very easy to get my 2 kids in and out of  10 months old and 2 1 2 years old It has a very nice  albeit noisy  ride  It drives a lot like my 1998 Honda Accord did  I replaced the Accord with the Windstar What we don t like The windshield washer button is on the end of the blinker control  I can t tell you how many times I ve washed the windshield while turning the corner  LOL  This might seem petty  but it is driving me crazy It is noisy  Not in terms of squeaks and rattles  but general road noise  poor insulation  My older son likes to sit in the  quot way back quot  and I can barely hear him talking  It is quieter than the Caravan though I slammed the middle two fingers of my right hand in the passenger sliding door the first time I closed it from the inside  The handle placement is VERY POORLY DESIGNED  If you don t completely wrap your fingers around the handle  WATCH OUT when you close the door from the inside  I m afraid to close it now I ve never gotten more than 15 miles per gallon and I drive 80  highway  The manufacturer claims 17 city 23 highway  The dealer said there is nothing wrong with it  It s not my driving though  because I get 15 mpg in my husband s Tahoe which has a huge V 8 engine and weighs twice as much While this is not necessarily a bad minivan  I would not buy this car again  I m already wishing for a new one We have not had this car in for repairs yet  we ve had it 6 months  but I have heard some weird transmission noises when putting in reverse  It also shifts from reverse to drive with a clunk and sometimes a lurch UPDATE 1 11 04 We ve had this car for 3 5 years now  It has about 38 000 miles on it  Most of our complaints repairs have been nuisances  However  last summer  we had to replace the entire steering system at a cost of about  1 400  The cruise control  from the beginning  has only worked when it wants to work  not necessarily when we want it to work  They can t fix it because it always seems to work when we take it to the shop  The rear air stopped working  and luckily that turned out to be a fuse  The automatic doors occasionally don t work  We had the transmission reprogrammed  and it doesn t clunk anymore We are in the process of trying to sell this car as we have replaced it with a 2004 Honda Pilot  which we absolutely LOVE
