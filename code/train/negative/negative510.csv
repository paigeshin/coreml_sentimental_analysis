 Having recently suffered through a disastrous experience with a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport  I ended up in an Escape XLT which I thought would ultimately be a better choice The Escape is a thoroughly modern SUV   well proportioned with a large interior  it matches or betters the Explorer in comfort in almost every area  The exterior design is efficient looking though not as stylish as the Toyota Rav4  In the forest green  I ve had people mistake the Escape for the new Rover Freelander b The Interior b The leather seats are not as firm  contoured or supportive as the fabric seats in the Explorer Sport  The dashboard styling is disappointing generic  And whoever designed the automatic gear shifter arm should be shot because one can t see the defrost button  Power outlets are not designed for cell phones to be used and plugged in   they are too low  And if you use a speaker cell phone cradle  the hockey stick of a shifter will get in the way Interior space for 4 passengers is very good  fine for 5  In fact  if you compare the specs  the Escape interior is almost identical to the larger Explorer Ergonomics are good everywhere else   gauges are the currently trendy white with black markings  The dash seems to be made of a cheap  hard shell plastic as opposed to the cushioned dash of the Explorer  I also have a wonderful 6 CD sound system that reminds me of the Mach 460 system in the Mustang  Unfortunately  on a very hot day  the CD system mysteriously failed for the afternoon  And recently  the rear window wiper motor failed as well Also disappointing was that the Escape didn t have the same back lit switches as the Explorer has  Power windows alone should be back lit at night  The Explorer also had puddle lamps which were very handy b Engine b The V6 engine is smooth and torquey though not much better than the Explorer V6 for gas mileage in the city  Highway driving seems to yield better mileage than the Explorer  This is apparently a derivation of the V6 used in the Taurus b Dealer network b The first time I ve dealt with a Los Angeles area Ford dealer  I was mortified at the poor support in the area of post sales  After taking the Escape off the lot  I spent the first weekend documenting a few things that needed to be tightened  fixed or touched up  When i brought the vehicle back  you would have thought I had asked them for their livers  I tried a different dealer who surprised me by telling me to go back to the dealer I bought the car from  Hardly a unified Ford team b Recalls  With the number of recalls on the Escape  I ve received 3 so far  the dealer network should be helluvalot more supportive to make sure that these cars are 100  Given the Firestone debacle with the Explorer  the Escape should be job one  When you get a recall  the Ford dealers don t seem to see how inconvenient it is to take the car in in the morning  get a ride to work  get a ride back to the dealership b Driving b The Escape is a pleasure to drive in the city and on the highway  Great pick up  a commanding view of the road and yet environmentally friendly than the giant Expeditions or Excursions I see  Very easy to park  The seats could be more supportive   especially given what the car can do  With all the talk about SUV rollover  the Escape startles traffic light racers with its speed and handling capabilities  Surprisingly  the turning circle is bigger than the Explorer so U turns end up being 3 pts b Overall b This is the first rational sized SUV and it made me rethink what city dwellers really need in an SUV  The Escape is a nice compromise but in its first year  iffy quality  poor dealer support and poor gas mileage would make me choose something else or wait another year  The Escape should be a very good car by next year once all the bugs and recalls are ironed out  Don t forget   this is Mazda engineering  the Mazda twin is called the Tribute I m looking at the PT Cruiser for my next car  see my review  because its size and proportions fit my needs  the styling is a lot more interesting than the Escape  the interior is a lot more innovative  and the bad Ford dealer experiences finished off my 16 year loyalty to the make
