 I bought this vehicle thinking i could take it on long trips  access remote vacationing areas  and hauling my boat  What I got was a gas guzzling snail  The Ford Explorer provides absolutely no power and is capable of nothing  While unsafe for street driving  it lacks the ground clearance for off road use  i bet i could find a Ferrari with more ground clearance than that of the Ford Explorer  I bought this car fully loaded  It had the works and let me tell you about these  quot works quot  The leather is of lowest quality  It comes with air holes poked all over the seat which look very cheap  This rig is about as nimble as a 747  Watch out for the roll factor when cornering at what you think is a reasonable speed  The Explorer has an extremely high center of gravity which makes it one of the most flipped automobiles on the road today  dispite the minimal ground clearance  Ford has found a way to still make the Explorer unsafe  The constipated roar that lurkes beneath the hood is nothing but empty power  There were VERY few things that satisfied me about this truck
