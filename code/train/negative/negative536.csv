 I must say that when I leased my new Ford Explorer Sport 4WD it was to replace my 1998 Ford Explorer Sport  I loved the 1998 model  It was dependable  reliable and got me where I needed to be even in the worst weather  Even on the beach it was super  When my lease expired and it was time for me to choose another vehicle  I went to the same dealer and traded the 1998 for the 2000 model  At first  I loved it  Then came very minor things that went wrong that I didn t think should have been wrong with a BRAND NEW SUV  The dealership fixed these things without problems but then came the Firestone tire recall  I must say I would not recommend the Ford Explorer to anyone after this tire recall  It truly is not fair to be so down on Ford and I realize that the tires were not known to be defective when they were installed on my vehicle  however  it was the WAY THE RECALL WAS HANDLED  or should I say mishandled  that turned me off to my SUV  I was told my car was safe to drive  dependable and reliable  I was also told that even though my tires on this vehicle were defective  there was no need to worry and that I didn t need to replace them  If it made me feel better  they recommended I find the nearest Firestone tire dealer  go there and have them replaced but that it was NOT NECESSARY to do so  It was this mishandling of the incident that makes me hate this particular vehicle and I wouldn t recommend this vehicle to anyone  Furthermore  I took the SUV back to the dealership  told them I didn t have time to be calling running around looking for Firestone tire dealers and that since this vehicle was under lease and I didn t own it and since I have been a loyal customer to this dealership for many years  I felt strongly it was their problem and they should replace the tires  I was told next that I should contact Ford Motor Company in Michigan and take it up with them because the dealership had no intention of replacing these tires
