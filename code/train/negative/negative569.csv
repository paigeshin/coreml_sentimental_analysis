 I bought the Contour in November  1975 as a second car  About a month after I drove it off the lot I started hearing a rubbing noise from the front  The problem turned out to be a front stabilizer bar bushing  Unfortunately the bushing is  pressed  onto the bar at the factory  so you have to buy the entire assembly  another Ford  better idea profit maximization at the expense of the customer  The extended warranty refused to cover the repair  so I was out approximately  185 A short time later  my  check engine  light kept coming on  The problem was diagnosed as a defective exhaust gas sensor  Once again  the extended warranty company wouldn t pay for the estimated  200 repair since it was not a covered component  Ford s emission warranty likewise passed the buck despite the fact that the sensor is part of the emission control system In the summer of  97  the engine cooling fan fried and the blower switch to the heater air conditioner stuck in the  low  position  After spending almost  500 to replace the cooling fan and fuse assembly  I just received a recall notice from Ford almost 4 years later  In addition  this car chews tire  suspension  and brake components with reckless abandon  I ve been through two sets of rotors both front and rear  three sets of disc brake pads  and two sets of tires  The car has also developed a head gasket leak and drips oil on the exhaust manifold  creating a most unpleasant smell when the car is warm Although this is a trifling problem by comparison with the other woes I ve had with the Contour  the ergonomics are poor  The power door lock button is located so close to the armrest that I ve locked the keys in the car on a few occasions getting out  and I might be the luckiest Contour owner on the face of the earth because the cheap plastic springloaded cupholders in my car still haven t broken yet  imagine that  This is the 11th Ford product I ve owned since 1978 and the most trouble prone of the lot  It will definitely be my last
