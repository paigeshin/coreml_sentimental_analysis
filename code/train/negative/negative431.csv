 My father recently fulfilled his dream of owning a sports vehicle  He went out and purchased a brand spanking new blue convertable Mustang  I guess when you reach the age of 71 you can do whatever you please  When pop s showed up at my house with his new  quot toy quot  my first impression of the car was  quot Wow quot  It sure was a beauty  And he didn t have to twist my arm to take a test drive  Getting into the vehicle was quite an obstacle  I think this car is made for people under 5 feet tall  And it felt odd sitting so close to the road  I m used to driving my Chevy full sized pickup  so this was a very unusual feeling for me  Almost like sitting in a little go cart  Lowering the top was pretty easy  once I figured out that I had to have the car in  quot park quot  and the  quot emergency brake quot  set  Then  with a simple push of a button  the roof smoothly went down  Away we went  Not as powerful as I expected a sports car to be  but a very smooth and comfortable ride  You ve got to really pay attention to the speedometer because it s easy not to realize just how fast you re driving this baby  In fact  my stepmother got a speeding ticket within 2 weeks of owning this car  There weren t too many features in this particular Mustang  It did include a pretty decent stereo system with AM FM radio  cassette player  and CD player  There were built in cup holders  and a covered compartment for storing things  The A C works great  Automatic seat adjustments  mirror adjustments  windows  and locks  Sure  it was thrilling driving this toy around  I particularly enjoyed the looks on my neighbor s faces as I passed them by  But is this car worth the price just to impress people  I think not  As a family man  this vehicle would not make a good choice  There is very little room for passengers in the back seat  and they must have very short legs to even have some remote comfort  Feeling pretty cramped  I just can t imagine making a long trip in this car  If you re single  have the money  the insurance is outrageous  and enjoy expensive showy cars  this one is for you  Personally  once the novelty had worn off  I was glad I own a truck br br
