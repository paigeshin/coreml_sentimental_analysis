 This is a beautiful car  Great styling  very comfy  The convertible top is almost childlike in it s ease of operation and the Mach 460 sound system is the best stock system that I have heard Now  for the bad news  The Mustang lacks quite alot in the performance area  To be the flagship sports car in Ford s line of autos it is sadly disappointing  I bought the Mustang after owning a 1998 Chevy Z 28 with a 6 speed transmission  Supposedly these two are  quot comparable cars quot  Not Quite  Though the Mustang s suspension rides nicer and sits better on the ground to allow for better cornering  in the long run that doesn t remotely make up for the difference in power  The Ford s 4 6 liter engine  though good on gas  lacks the gusto of the 5 7 LS1 in the Camaro  If you are in the market for a great looking  comfortable ride in a car that has a sports car imagine but passes up most gas stations due to the lack of raw power this is the car for you  But if you want an all out beast and want to get your money s worth in a so called sports car  I suggest you pass up the Ford dealership and head for the nearest Bowtie shop br br
