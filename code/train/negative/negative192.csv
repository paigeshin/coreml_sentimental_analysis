 One year ago driving by my local ford dealership I noticed a sharp looking SUV  So I turned around and took it for a test drive  Pleased with the price and the way it looked I traded vehicles  I was very pleased with the way it drives for the first week  then came rain  Having owned two SUVs before this one and had no problems driving during bad weather  Well it was a different story for the explorer  IT S VERY HARD TO HANDLE ON A WET ROAD  And if the wind is blowing hard you might as well pull over  Besides driving during bad weather I have been haunted with recall letters I think i have had 4 so far and i am sure there will be more soon  Now lets talk about ford quality parts that the explorer is made of  5 months after the impulse buy that I made several parts STOP working first thing to go was the back windshield wiper  well it works when it wants to not when I need it to  Then my fog lights  ground lights  work when its warm  haven t figured that one out yet Nor has the dealer  any suggestions  Also when I turn on the turn left signal my wipers come on and then go off  I m no expert when it comes to wiring but is this not a short in the electrical system  now the cigarette lighter does not work   there are many other small things about the explorer I don t like but I guess that s what I get for IMPULSE BUYING  And after going through all of this in less than a years time   I would NOT recommend the 99 explorer sport to ANYONE
