 This is an update of my adventures with this car I ve had it for more than a year now  I ve driven back and forth to Portland four times  I moved once in it  I ve taken it up a mountain pass twice  and you know what  I don t like it any better  It s been towed at least three times  gotten two flat tires in a month  and had to walk or borrow other people s cars far too often  Just when I think I have everything taken care of  and am beginning to grow fond of it  the car betrays me again  It truly breaks my heart  A guy s first car should be something he can be fond of or something  not a POS that he hates with all his soul and curses regularly  The transmission fell out one and a half times before I just bought one and handed it to a mechanic  I have scars from this car  It hates me  too  I m sure  This is not my fault  as I loved it at first because it was my car  and it was zippy and fun  and it was wheels  Now it is my wagon of the devil and we disrespect each other equally Negatives  Maybe I got a lemon  Brakes go from fine to shot in no time at all  Front wheel drive makes it extremely hard to do routine maintenance on  The body is easily succeptible to damage  The tire and brake wear is very uneven  Positives  Does not guzzle oil  Once you get a good tranny in it  will wear for a long time  Gas consumption extremely efficient b Original material  I see millions of these on the road  and I notice that all of them are LX s  That s the model with a stereo and A C  I bought  about four months ago  a grey Pony at the beginning of the summer  It had a stereo and A C  Never do this  The A C fell out  literally  causing me to have to work on the serpentine belt almost all summer long  the engine runs really hot  and the seals around the axles gave out almost immediately  Once I got used to running this car without A C  it seems to run really efficiently  not needing any thing to be changed much  and with very little maintainence  I should also point out the speedometer lead fell off  and I racked up at least a 1000 miles that will never go on the odometer  This is pretty disappointing  My parents had an Areostar van they ran into the ground  and it went forever  I haven t even cracked 100 000 miles yet  and it s already sounding like it s going to come apart around my ears  I probably won t for a long time  but who wants to drive a car that sounds like it could fall apart at any moment  Doesn t impress the ladies much  For a budget car  if you can get a model like this that wasn t jerry rigged by some swine in a used car dealership  it will probably serve you well  My sister got a car like this  wagon  at the same time  only two years newer  and hasn t had a single complaint  so go the little extra and buy a 94 LX  You won t notice the difference  because you ll have a car that won t have anything perpetually going wrong  Before I complain too much  I should point out that I really like the lines of this car  and for a cheap pile of junk  it hauls pretty well  and I like it even though I complain Thanks for reading my opinion
