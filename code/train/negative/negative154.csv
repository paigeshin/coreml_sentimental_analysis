 I bought my Ford Explorer because of the way it drove  looked and performed  Last week I would have given the Explorer an A  review  However coming home from work last week  I experienced the fear of a lifetime  I always use my cruise control  and never doubted that when I put my foot on the brake  the cruise control would disengage  This was NOT the case last week  Instead  it went faster  I got off the Interstate  going about 70 miles an hour  I was relieved to be heading for a field  where I could not hurt anyone else  I tried to disengage the cruise control on the panel  with no success  As I neared the field I noticed that there was a rocky culvert and a barb wire fence surrounding it  making it impossible to get to the open field Having slowed the car down to 40 with the emergency brake  I was forced to throw the Explorer into Park  When my knees stopped shaking  I got out of the car and noticed that the tires were smoking  A man on a tracker came by and called for help When my friend arrived  he got in and the brakes worked fine  This leads me to believe that it is a defect in the cruise control Now my  Check Engine  light is on and the car does not idle  I have to push down on the excelerator  just to get my car to move  My tires are dangerous to drive on Hopefully Ford Motors will take care of the damage it caused  But I am not sure they will  as the car now has 50 000 miles on it and no longer under warranty  Has anyone had this problem occur to their Explorer  Whether under warranty or not  I think they should take this episode very seriously
