 Having been a FORD worshipper for many years  I have finally  quot de sourced quot  FORD as a supplier for my family cars  Dating back to to the late 1980 s  I had not purchased anything but FORD products  From a Taurus Wagon to two Escorts and two Explorers  FORD products were  in my opinion  the best quality cars suv s on the market  Lately though I have changed my mind  Yesterday I received my second recall letter in less than six months Everyone has heard of the Firestone fiasco  Today s recall concerns the suspension system  And over the years I have had a huge amount of trouble with the 4 wheel drive system  The new FORD Focus has been out for less than a year and has had 5 recalls already  What s going on  Since my company is a supplier to the automotive industry  I can only assume that FORD will be going steadily downhill  For the past 6 or so years  to boost their profits  they have demanded from all suppliers a 5  per year reduction in price  Their Q1 program is supposed to reduce costs such as waste  and inefficiencies to allow the supplier to pass along the savings  How many years in a row can you reduce your price and not cut back  Could you work for 5  a year less every year  Sooner or later you would need to cut back some critical area affecting your quality of life  Well the same is true with suppliers  you can only go so far  Some suppliers have redesigned their product so they can sell a cheaper product   Note  My company supplies a non critical item  My guess is that they are cutting corners in quality which passes the initial FORD testing but is failing in the long run  The blowouts involving Firestone were mainly on original equipment tires  not the aftermarket  I no longer trust FORD or their products  They are our worst customer I will no longer buy a FORD vehicle br br
