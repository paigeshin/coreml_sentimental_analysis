 It s funny  as I read the reviews for the Ford Windstar it sounded just like my exact thoughts I had when I first bought the van  I loved my 96 Windstar for the safety features  strong engine  low insurance costs  roominess  and ride  Then the warranty ended and the problems began  The cruise control worked only when it wanted the upper subframe mount broke  the ABS light came on  electrical short  the automatic locking feature would lock every few minutes the one feature that I have come to hate even when working properly  and lastly  and most expensive  the head gasket blew at 65 000 miles  2500 00  Ford has had many problems with the head gasket on the 3 8 V 6  in fact they have extended the warranty on 95 s to 100 000 miles to cover the problem  but I have a 96 and that doesn t count in Fords eyes  Calling Ford customer service  1 800 392 3673  is useless  sorry sir your file on this matter is closed I m filing a complaint with the NHTSA and I am writing a letter to Ford for reimbursement  Lastly  I would like to break down the overall rating at the end of this review  4 the first two years of ownership  1 for the reliability and customer service  dealership and Ford hotline  and for after the warranty period br br
