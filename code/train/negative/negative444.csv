 I am a young woman and a first time car buyer who grew up around cars  I have always wanted a true  quot muscle quot  car and when I had the chance to purchase a new  99 Mustang I did  It was the car of my dreams  Well  actually a  67 GT Fast back was but beggars can t be choosers I bought my car in Canada at a reputable dealer and was thrilled  Not long after I moved to the city for a new job  I had never had any problems with my car and I loved it but as luck would have it little things started to happen Well  I have now had my car for a year and a half and slowly but surely things have started to deteriorate  I have had my heat sheild replaced twice  My side mirrors have been replaced because the gears that drive them have gone bad  My transmission is going already  There is a major lack of power when going up hills  For the longest time my brakes would work when they felt like and according to the computer system in my car there is nothing wrong with it  I am writing this simply to warn all prospective buyers  Please  please  please take the car for a long test drive first  Make sure that where you purchase the car they are willing to listen to you when you tell them there is something wrong  And last but not least  search the internet for horror stories on any car you are going to purchase before you do  You find out a lot more about a car that way then what the salesmen are willing to tell you br br
