 Ford taurus  have to be the worse car on the road today mechanically  sure  it looked good  but not worth all the money you need to sink in to it to keep it running  I put a total of 4 transmissions in mine and even that one was on it way out when i traded it in  There are also 2 safety issues i have with this car  first one is the engine mounts fell off  yes  my engine flew to the ground just about  they did recallit butnot until after ipaid that expense  The second and more serious flaw is that on a 90 degree turn into oncoming traffic  the turn signal switch that is inside the steering column broke off inside causing me to loose control of all steering  They still have not recalled this even though i know many people this happened to and they called it in also  I would never purchase a ford taurus again  heck  i wouldnt even take one for free unless i owned a money tree br br
