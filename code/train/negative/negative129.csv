 If you look around high school and college campuses around the United States you will notice one thing is similar about all of them  that is the number of Ford Mustangs parked in the dorms and student parking lots  I remember as a younger driver  I always wanted a piece of the good old American muscle car and had narrowed my choice to a  68 Fastback and a  70 Mach 1  As my opinions differed and I grew up I noticed that the car I once held on to in my dreams became less appealing to me  It was a simple explanation really  I wanted to be different and how could I manage that without giving up the Mustang as a car choice  Granted up til  96 the engines were 5 0 liter and it seemed that the  89 GT was the fastest GT on the market  the one thing I could not overlook was the number of them on the road  I knew of two friends from high school who had consecutive models of mustangs  one was a  95 Cobra and the other a  96 GT 4 6 liter and that really discouraged me from buying one of my own  Another thing I encountered was the actual materials used to make a Mustang  My junior year of high school a friend and I were in a car accident involving a Mustang and an Explorer  Needless to say i was furious at what I saw constituting as a front bumper on a Mustang  styro foam  granted it was hard styro foam  the fact remained it was styro foam instead of some material more solid  For that I made my decision final  a mustang was not for me  Now I am not knocking any Mustang lovers down for their opinions but I am saying that when it comes to actual muscle cars of the nineties  this old boy will stick with the Chevy Corvette br br
