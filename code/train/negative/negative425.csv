 This vehicle was a first time lease for my husband and I  It was the only car we qualified for so our choices were limited  We really enjoyed owning a new car  It ran great and we were very pleased with the outside body and all the functions of the motor We found the interior very disappointing  From the first week we had the car there were problems with the interior  The carpet pulled away from the frame and it took 18 months for them to get the parts to fix it  We also had problems with the plastic molding that enclosed the seat belts This molding broke 4 times in 2 years and has to be replaced each time which put the car in the shop for at least one day  At about 20 months the driver side window crank broke off and the dealer said it was not under warranty  Then a week later the passenger side broke also  Neither of the cranks had much use at any time  This car drives smoothly  but if you are looking for good wear and tear this car is not the one  I can not see children doing well in this car br br
