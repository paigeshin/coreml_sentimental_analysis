 My husband and I were needing a bigger car after our 2nd child was born  We wanted something larger than our civic so that we had room to grow and wouldn t have to buy another car for awhile We saw this beautiful burgandy Taurus  It had great features  It had only 17 000 miles on it  It had power windows  doors  steering  airbag etc  The interior was very clean also  It in a dark burgandy suede feeling like material  The dealership said that it had been a rental car in Hawaii  So we figured that maybe it was a pretty good car We wanted it really bad  It was a closeout and they were offering a pretty good deal on it  We ended up buying it and brought it home  After about a month or so  the air conditioner went out on it  My husband took it back to the auto store that we bought it from and they hesitantly fixed it  There were a few other weird things that went wrong with it  We decided to sell it  because we both thought that it would die on us any minute  My sister wanted to buy it from us  thinking that we were making up the weird things in our heads  We hesitantly sold it to her thinking that if something went wrong  she knew where we lived  etc  When we sold it to her  we had took the miles up to 23 000  She hadn t owned the car even two years  when she got stranded 200 miles from home  because the transmission went out on it  A year or so later  the engine went out on it  They ended up selling the car  It was a bad apple  They also ended up having to replace the struts on it  Now  I know that we weren t hard on the car  In fact  I really only drove it around town for errands  etc If you are smart  you will stay away from this year of Taurus  I don t know about the other years  but my husband and I have not had any desire to own another one br br
