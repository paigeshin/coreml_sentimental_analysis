 I purchased this vehicle in 1998 as it was coming off a lease  The mileage was low  and the body was in great condition  and when I drove it there were no problems  Since purchasing it though  we have had quite a few problems  Brakes went early  and of course you all have heard about the tire recalls  We also had to replace the front stabilizer bar several times  This was another recall  but as a second owner  we didn t hear about it  and had to pay for it ourselves  Finally  our transmission died with still low mileage on the vehicle  Doing some research online  I found that this problem has happened to thousands of Ford owners  and that Ford is aware of the problem  but is unwilling to help with costs  or to even address the issue  See this website for an example  http www carlounge com cgi carsbbs read php f 1 i 1722 t 1411  I decided to trade my car in  since the cost to repair or replace the transmission was estimated at  2000 3000  I didn t get a whole lot for it  certainly not blue book value  since dealers are having a hard time reselling Fords  I now have a used Infiniti Qx4 that has a 7 year  100 000 full warranty  Can t beat that
