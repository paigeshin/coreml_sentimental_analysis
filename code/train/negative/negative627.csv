 IS THIS SUV FOR YOU The older style Ford Bronco  1966 1977  is most suitable for someone who has a working knowledge about cars is prepared to do a little maintenance  This car makes a better hobby than daily driver  However  there is plenty of room and it is very simple under the hood so it is a good car to learn on if you are not confident with your automotive abilities  It s a great attention getter on the street and performs very well off road  It can weave through narrow obstacles yet has a long enough wheel base that it isn t too  quot squirelly quot  on the road  It is nice because the hard top is removable  but very heavy  and can provide the open air feeling of a convertible  Original equipment  especially body panels  can be a challenge to find for a decent price but there are many after market products available if you d like to modify it  In my opinion  the model fills the void between a jeep and full size SUV  WHAT DO I LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING AN OLDER BRONCO  It depends on what you d like to use it for  If you have any intention at all of  quot fixing it up quot  one day  the most important thing you can look for is a rust free body  Body panels are expensive and tough to find  A good rule of thumb is to check the floorboards under drivers feet   if they are rusted through move on to another vehicle  Be aware that many people put sheet metal over the rusted area to cover it here  If you are looking to use it off road make sure to buy one with the Dana 44 in the front end and  quot large bearing quot  rear end  all models came with a Ford 9 inch rear end  The large bearing has stouter brake drums and wheel bearings  Many models came with a Dana 30 front end  The Dana 30 has many drawbacks  parts are hard to find  it s unique to Broncos  it is more costly to upgrade to disk brakes  and they are not as strong  However  the Dana 30 is sufficient for daily driving and occasional off road use  The other main consideration is power steering and power brakes   these options were primarily available on the 1973 1977 models  There are many after market kits you can buy to upgrade to these options but these are pricey and can be tedious to install  I see non power assisted Broncos as being better for off road use because there are fewer things that can break off road and leave you stranded  However  daily street driving is compromised without these luxuries  especially if you install larger tires  A Bronco with power steering and power brakes will bring a premium  Finally  you ll probably want a Bronco that has an automatic transmission   even if you us it off road  The manual transmission equipped on Broncos was a 3 speed  on the steering column  and it often has inoptimal gearing for driving off road  There are many after market adapters available for upgrading to a 4 speed manual transmission from an older Ford truck but his can  again  be pricey and a tedious conversion If you want power  find one with a Ford 302 cubic inch engine  Not only is this a V 8 but the components allow for the  quot bolt in quot  addition of a Ford 351 Windsor motor if the 302 is not enough for you In summary  the premium Bronco will have a no rust  Dana 44  large bearing  12 inch brake drum v s  10 inch  power steering and power brakes  automatic transmission and a 302 cubic inch motor  If you want to own the Bronco that everyone will envy and will be less costly to upgrade or restore in the future  don t buy one without these options  However  if you have a specific use you plan on using your Bronco for  buy the one that will best suit your needs  WHAT ARE THE PROS OF OWNING AN OLDER BRONCO Every other Bronco owner you meet will wave at you  it s almost like joining an elite club  They perform very well off road  especially with the right modifications  After market components are abundant  You get a lot of attention driving these cars  They are fairly simple under the hood and are practical to fix off road and under poor conditions  The front and rear drive lines are interchangable in case one is damaged  There are many after market parts available  They are a very fun SUV   and one of the first ever made  There is ample sheet metal and provide great protection in an accident but make sure a roll bar is installed  WHAT ARE THE CONS They are expensive to maintain  especially if you take them off road  Even thought hey have a longer wheelbase than a jeep they still have a stiff ride on the highway  Expect  quot bump steer quot   steering wheel will move when you hit a bump  especially if you own one with no power steering and larger tires  Body parts are scarce  They are prone to rolling over under extreme driving circumstances   Never drive one without a roll bar
