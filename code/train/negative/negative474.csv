 Real life comments on usability on our 1995 Ford Escort Wagon We sold our Toyota PU  for a family car  because we were expecting a child  and needed to be able to have a child car seat in it  We also are a one car family  Going from the pick up  which had good mileage and hauling capacity  we wanted a station wagon We picked the Ford Escort over the Subaru for a few reasons  but mostly cost and fuel economy  The Subaru has become a  quot sport utility quot  and the cost has shot up  while the fuel economy went down We have not been disappointed  The Escort gets good mileage  mid 20 s in the city  and 29 30 mpg on the highway  With a stick  it s zippy and responsive  We feel safe in it Ours we picked up used  45K for  5 500 in 1998  when it was almost 4 years old  We bought from an owner directly  But as I looked in used car lots  I saw alot of similar cars  in the  6 500 7 000 range  and didn t have as nice packages  automatic  no AC  etc  So I think we got a good deal  Plus  all we ve had to do to it is regular maintenance b Good things about it   are some of the features like the stock radio is nice  having a tach  and nice dashboard layout  It s got several dome lights and has power rear view mirrors  that make it easy for adjusting  It s also got a tiny  insignificant feature I like  a little arrow by the fuel gage that tells you what side of the car the fule lid is on  The front seats work nice  and the back has a split 1 3rd 2 3rd seat  for loading b Bad things about it   are that the car is a bit small  I m 5 10 quot  210 pounds  sometimes I bonk my head  but I don t feel  quot cramped quot  once settled in  And while the car seat for the kiddo works  my back does get a big tweaked from time to time  and she s had her head bonked a few times as well  I m not sure this car would work as the only car for a family with two teenagers  Right now  and until the kids are 7 10  I think it would be fine The other downer  is that the car sometimes sounds a bit  quot tinny quot  this is kind of unfounded  but my worry  it that it won t hold up over time  I mean  will I be able to put 200 000 miles on this car  or will things start to break  A few insignificant things are starting to show wear at 56 000 miles  My concern is how the car will age  will I see lots of this in the next 20 30 000 miles I ll keep you posted b Andr b br br
