 I purchased our Ford Taurus LX Wagon used with 19K miles and we bought it because I was impressed by it s long list of features and by the way it drove  We had just sold our Ford Aerostar minivan and we were looking for a smaller  more economical family car  What we ended up was a car that just cannot be repaired properly and is not very reliable We have had problems with the interior door panels cracking  the dash bubbling  the power window motors burning out  turn signals that work when they want to  a moon roof that has hardly ever worked  inability to align the front end so we go through a pair of tires every 20K miles  I have only had it serviced by Ford and they have failed to repair most of our problems even after numerous attempts  The Ford dealers no longer believe in test drives  they just look for a problem and charge you even if they cannot find it  I got charged  75 00 to be told that I needed a new  55 00 battery  I also took the car in to have a rubber seal around the door replaced and they charged me  30 00 just to tell me how much it would cost to replace This is my 3rd and last Ford  I had two Ford Explorers and Ford bought both of them back under the California Lemon Law I wanted to love this car  I wanted to forget about my bad experiences with my two previous Explorers but this car is by far worst in every manner I have had it with Ford  Quality is not Job  1  Profit is  Don t even get me started about the fact that Ford knew about the Firestone tire defects for years but still kept putting them on my Explorer and all others  I was the lucky one who is still around to express my displeasure with Ford  The only reason I still have our Taurus because the value has dropped faster than my loan for it  If I sold it today I would lose a few thousand bucks
