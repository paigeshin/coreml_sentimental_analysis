 We bought this car for price and fuel economy  as a 2nd car It is a reliable car that gets good gas mileage Unfortunately  it is microscopic  the ride is unpleasant  it rattles like crazy uncomfortable seats  no features  and if it came into contact with anything larger than a basketball it would be smashed to bits  Not a fun car to own  buy only if desperate You feel every pothole like you are being dragged over it face first  and it rides as high as a skateboard  The front seats are bearable  but the back seat is quite possibly the most unpleasant place on earth  It s acceleration is weak from its pitiful 1 3L four  but it can nip in between cars and gets you where you need to go though I wouldn t take it on the highway at gunpoint  I could almost call it sporty if its top speed was higher than 85 mph  But all it is is a small hatchback  nothing more  Go for a sedan  you probably shouldn t buy this under any conditions  Its only plus is that it never needs repairs  but we never use it much  it has 25k on it  that s all  Much more and I m certain there would be more problems  It s lack of power locks and windows is infuriating  I d more than trade the power seat belt for those What s more ironic is that this is the GL model  which by all rights should be better br br
