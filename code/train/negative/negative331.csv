  L ike the  a href content 51265113732 Geo Chevrolet Metro a  the tiny Ford Aspire has the same ultimate goal in mind  excellent fuel economy between point A to point B transportation  If you buy the Ford Aspire  and  aspire  something from this car other than the fuel saving micro machine that it is  than you are setting yourself up for a unfortunate let down   S ince the Ford Aspire s introduction in 1994 as a replacement for the Festiva  it has come in 2 trim lines  a 2 door hatchback and a 4 door hatchback  my test car  The same 1 3 liter SOHC 4 cylinder engine has been used since introduction  The engine out put remained the same until its last year in  97 at 63 horsepower at 5 000 RPM  and 74 lb ft of torque at 3 000 RPM  Ford offers 2 transmissions for the Aspire  a 3 speed automatic  and a 5 speed manual gear box i Driving Impressions i  Off the line  acceleration  is what you would expect from a car pumping 63 horse power to the front wheels via a 3 speed automatic  very slow  I m sure the standard 5 speed manual transmission would have increased the performance a bit  but we are still talking about a car with 63 horses and a curb weight of around 2 100lbs  so even a 5 speed gear box would not have been the saving grace for this car  At a light  or from a standing start  the Ford Aspire  under full throttle  almost doesn t know what to do  At first the car stalls  as if it is preoccupied looking at the much more intimidating car next to you  then it realize s that the driver needs to move in a hurry and does its best to scoot from the light  Unfortunately  its best  comes in the form of a buzzy exhaust note  tons of engine noise  poor shifting  and acceleration that could match an 18 speed bicycle   Handling  is also not exactly something to write home about  The 13  wheels and the tiny 90 7  wheelbase make this car very skittish over poor road surfaces  and the suspension doesn t help this car achieve any driver confidence while on the twistys   Cruising  in the 1997 Ford Aspire is  to say the most  uninvolving and quite annoying  The 1 3 liter engine  when it finally does reach a freeway speed limit  is still very loud  Wind  road  and engine noise plague the cabin of the car   Braking   despite having a dinosaur set up of disc brakes in the front and drums in the rear  braking was quite good  Braking in the Aspire assured relatively quick emergency stops with little fade   Fuel Economy b  The 1997 Ford Aspire is rated at 34 city 42 highway  yet I observed around 28 city and 32 highway  this significantly lower observed rating is undoubtedly due to the optional 3 speed automatic that was equipped in my tester i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior   unlike the performance of this car is not what you d expect  Despite the tiny size  this car is actually relatively roomy  about the room you d find in a Ford Escort  The Instrument cluster is easy to read  but the dash looks cheap  as does all the materials in this car  Cheap  kids toy like  plastic is what Ford has always loved to use in their economy cars  and the Aspire is no exception  Amenities are far and few  my option list included a 4 speaker cassette player  air conditioning  power steering  and driver   front passenger air bags are standard  The seats are stiff and offer no lumbar supports  but I found them to be relatively comfortable  and superior to the seating in the  a href content 51265113732 Geo Chevrolet Metro a  Front leg room is adequate  but like most compacts the rear is very cramped  The seats in the rear fold down to offer a boat load of cargo room  something I did not expect i Exterior Innovation i  You have no doubt seen the  exterior  of a Ford Aspire  they are almost everywhere on the road  despite being in production for only 4 full years before its demise in 1997  The Body of the Aspire is very oval  almost reminding me of an  egg on wheels  I believe this opinion is shared by many  The wheels are also very small  13  so this exacerbates this unattractive  egg  theme  My test Aspire came with a rear spoiler  and semi sporty hubcaps  I m not sure if this made this car look more  sporty  or made it look more like a mistake   Price   Reliability i  Back in  97 the Ford Aspire ran for around  10 000 12 000  depending on the optional equipment  Today most people who are selling their  97 Ford Aspire s ask for less than  3 000  If you go to a dealer used car lot you can expect to pay around  4 000 or more  These cars have been very reliable over the past 8 years  according to many owners  although I have a sneaky suspicion that these cars will have their share of problems after 100K miles due to the engine constantly working overtime to keep these cars up to speed b Other cars to consider b 1  Hyundai Accent 2  Ford Escort 3  Geo Metro  a href content 51265113732 http www epinions com content 51265113732 a   My Review 4  Pontiac Sunfire 5  Chevrolet Cavalier 6  VW
