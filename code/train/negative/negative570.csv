 I purchased this vehicle after driving my  86 Toyota Celica to the ground delivering pizzas  I was then done with that job and wanted a decent car to last me a long time  I found a two year old Contour for  9000 and decided it was a good deal and got it And in fact it hasn t been a horrible car  Despite a few recalls  it keeps running with minimal maintenance  I think the worst problem I had was that the tires needed replaced  But there is always a feeling owning this car that it is going to break down any time  The engine is loud  the V4  and doesn t have a very smooth sound  There were some knocking too that had nothing to do with the type of gas I was giving it  I had also spoken too other people who had owned the car  and their opinion was more negative than mine  They said that the car was plagued with recalls and was not very reliable The drive was decent  nothing too notable  Compared to the Celica I had  it rode up high  The V4 didn t have a lot of muscle  despite the fact that my Contour had a manual transmission  I am certainly glad I didn t get the Automatic All in all  it was a good car while we owned it  We traded it in after it had 65 000 miles  I didn t want to press my luck any further  Speaking of trade in  I didn t get much for it   2k for a 1995  I know I could have gotten more but not much more  But overall  there are much better choices out there  I traded it in for Toyota and I am very happy with that  The  quot comfort quot  level  i e  the confidence in the car  owning the Toyota is much higher than it was for the Ford If you can find a good deal on a Contour  a really good deal  go for it  but otherwise keep searching br br
