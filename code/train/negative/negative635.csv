  SHO  is supposed to stand for  super high output  I personally wouldn t call 235 HP from a 3 4 liter DOHC V8  super high output  but I guess Ford thinks thought it was worthy of the name  Its 235 horsepower V8 and good road manners means that this Ford can almost hang  in out right performance  with the finest sedans from its European and Japanese rivals  such as the BMW 325i and the Acura Legend i Driving Impressions i  The latest  SHO  is much more manageable to drive than the original models  Although sadly to say  much slower  and nowhere near as fun  Unfortunately the SHO is FWD  RWD with an added traction control would have been a nice feature  The  suspension  set up provides a comfortable highway ride  while keeping the car flat through fast turns  letting you really enjoy this small V8  The only problem here is that rattles seem to be abundant throughout the cabin over slight bumps  or at high speeds  Throttle response is good  and there is power all the way up to the 6 800 RPM  red line  It can go 0 100 MPH in less than 22 seconds  according to specs   whoopi di woooo  you might say  but this is very fast for a family sedan costing less than  35 000 for the  98 model year   L ike the SHO s first V6 engine  the 3 4 liter  all alloy  60 degree V8 is a collaboration between Ford and Yamaha  Each concentrates on its own strengths  so Ford builds the bottom end  with balancer shaft to keep it smooth at high RPM  which is then shipped to Japan for the 4 valve per cylinder Yamaha twin over head cam heads to be fitted  Although torque peaks at 4 800 RPM  70  is available at an almost idle 1 200 RPM   U nlike Ford s other V8 powered cars  the SHO has its engine mounted transversely  and driving the front wheels  It does this through a 4 speed fully automatic transmission  Unfortunately A manual is not available The two electronically controlled shocks and multi link rear  suspension  give relatively good handling  Despite being an all alloy engine  the 3 4 is heavier than the previous  before  96  3 0 and 3 2 220 horsepower engines i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the Taurus SHO is quite luxurious  The comfortable interior is designed to compete with rivals from BMW and Audi  Sorry Ford  but the SHO does not compete in this category if you ask me  The plastics in the SHO are of marginal quality  and the seating feels cheap  and offers nowhere near as much support as the seats in the BMW 325i  The SHO does however have good ergonomics  and tons of standard amenities  power sunroof  power door locks etc  comes with an ice cold AC  and power seats with lumbar support i Exterior Innovation i  Some say this car is  smooth and sleek  I say the SHO s  exterior  design looks more like a big  egg on wheels than anything else  This design never grew on me  in fact  on the contrary I disliked it the more I saw it  The only thing this car has going for in the looks department is the dual exhaust  Ford has changed this design for the 2000 model year  unfortunately the SHO trim line did not return  making the regular 200 horsepower 3 0 Duratec V6 the top of the line power plant i Pricing i  The  price  is getting pretty low for these cars  Nobody really wanted the SHO beings that the competiton offered much more value  i e  the Grand Prix GTP  These cars are not  that fast  they have good  but not spectacular interiors  downright ugly exterior looks  they get relatively poor gas mileage  are not on the top of the list for reliable cars  yet Ford has the audacity to stick a  31 000 dollar price tag on it  I don t blame the public for not wanting to pay that price  A 1998 model however now can be found for around  14 000 or less  typical Ford Taurus resale value i Conclusion i  Because of the poor resale of the 98 Taurus SHO these cars are now an exceptional buy  If you are looking for a cheap family sedan on the used market the Taurus SHO does offer good bang for the buck b Other Cars To Consider b i 1  Chevy Monte Carlo  a href content 61018443396 http www epinions com content 61018443396 a   MY Review 2  Chevy Lumina Z34 3  BMW 328i 4  Saab 9000 Aero 5  Dodge Stratus 6  Dodge Intreped 7  Ford Thunderbird V8 8  Mercury Cougar 9  Toyota Camry V6 10  Honda Accord V6 Coupe  Happy Car shopping
