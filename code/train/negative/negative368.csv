 We  quot inherited quot  a 1993 Ford Explorer in December of 1998  It was great until it had about 100 000 miles on it and just stopped at a red light  It would start  but when we put it in to drive  it stalled  We had it towed to a transmission place  When we called the mechanic  he said   quot Let me guess it has between 70 80 000 miles on it quot  We said no  that it had about 100 000  He then told us how lucky we were because we got an extra 20 000 miles out of the old transmission  He told us that he installs at least five new transmissions on Explorers a week  It was a pretty good car up to that point  other than the fact that it s small engine can t go up hills very easily  We drove this car to Colorado from Texas and prayed the whole way  It barely made it there and back  struggling the whole way  I urge you to call a transmission shop before you buy an Explorer  They will be able to tell you much better than I am
