 The Ford Winstar may seem like to answer to all your family s needs  but beware  there can be some drawbacks to this vehicle that you ll want to consider   PS  I saved the worst problem for last Why we bought a Winstar After a lengthly search of all the auto market has to offer for a family of seven to ride in  we settled on the Winstar  I have owned several Ford vehicles in the past and felt like  Quality was still Job  quot  this this brand  I was torn between the modern looking Taurus wagon and the Winstar  Although the Taurus wagon with the fold away jumpseat in the back actually seats 8  we felt like the benefits of the split front driver passenger seat in the minivan would be better for taking care of kids riding behind you  What I Hate About The Winstar 1  Inadequate Air Conditioning System Problems began a few hours after we rolled off the showroom floor and the passengers in the back  especially in the third seat became hot and sweaty  We realized that the air conditioning system is totally inadequate for rear passengers  We live in Texas  yes it get s hot here  however  any temperatures above 80 degrees and the folks in the back get hot and sweaty very quickly  I lost track of how many times I would arrive to the store or church and unload my poor soaking wet w sweat kids from the back  My baby drinks an extra bottle each time we go somewhere because he just gets so hot  If you get a Winstar  pay extra and get the second A C system or you ll regret it 2  Strangling Seatbelts This has not happened to us before  but the Winstar s seatbelts just don t seem to be satisfied with the hold they can have on you  They keep tightening up until your neck feels like it s being sawed off  or worse  you get a lovely seatbelt hickey to hide  I hate to say it  but I even found myself dressing in certain garments in order to protect my neck  I even bought short sleeved little turtlenecks in the summer  now  I keep a soft towel handy to tuck against my neck to alleviate  I am 5 1 2 feet tall so this is not a short person problem for me  however  if you aren t that tall  watch your neck 3  Power Steering Problems The hoses for the power steering leak and seem to be prone to developing this  Wouldn t you know that you can only get the hoses from Ford and they are expensive too  I have been having to add power steering fluid to the Winstar about twice a week or it makes a horrible grinding noise that makes nearby neighbors and pedestrians stop and stare as we drive by Get ear muffs for the neighbors unless you like  being noticed  alot 4  Flying hubcaps This is weird  but the hubcaps just don t like to stay on this car  Okay  you probably think I am a lousy driver  but after twenty years of driving  I have never had to replace so many  Of course the Ford hubcaps are  100  each  forget that  Good luck trying to by nice wheels for it  I found out the front wheel drive rims for this baby are a fortune   Get on with wheels 5  The Very Worst Thing About the Winstar This is the pathetic part  With this many problems  I wanted to trade my Winstar in for something else  I found out that after buying the vehicle 18 months previously and taking very good care of it  the Winstar I paid  22 000  for was now worth a trade in of  9000 only 18 short months and 16 000 miles later  I couldn t believe it I was so upset  I had to stomp out of several dealerships before I realized that this vehicle loses practically half it s value when you roll off the showroom floor  No one can justify that to me folks What I Love About It I still maintain that the design of the minivan is an excellent one for transporting people of all ages comfortably  The design of the Winstar is very functional  If you like the design  then may I suggest the Dodge Caravan  Both minivans are of a similar design  however  the new Caravans are more streamlined  cool the inside better  and the seatbelts are friendly  My mom got a Caravan and I am jealous  It is a pleasure to drive the Winstar  I like being able to see what s going on in the traffic ahead of me  I will confess  when I drove my Mom s Caravan  it did handle better and the back seat can actually switch places with the middle bench seat and give you more options  The Winstar does not allow you to switch the places of the seats  only to fold them down or take them out completely I have considered myself a Ford person up until now  I think I am going to go Dodge next time around  that is whenever I finally get out from under my Winstar s ridiculous trade in situation Take Care  Happy Motoring Love Your Margarine br br
