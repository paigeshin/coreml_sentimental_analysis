 This car is terrible  It is falling apart and even Ford customer service does not care  I have 6700 miles on it and it has already spent a total of 16 days in the shop  A major leak not only soiled the interior  but destroyed the air conditioning which was entirely replaced by ford  My biggest fear is that after 12 000 i will be paying more than the car is worth to keep the thing running  I have had the brakes checked and fixed 2 times and entirely replaced another  and they continue to make a loud shreak every time i stop  and the car is practically new  Don t trust the other reviews  anyone who says ANYTHING positive about this car either works for Fords Corporate offices or is a Ford salesman Dont believe the lies  Updated Details  I was pleased with the car for the first week or two  but then the brakes did start to squeek  My first dealings with the people who sold me the car were at 3 000 miles  for its free first oil change  I left the vehicle for the entire day  and they had done nothing with it when I went to pick it up  It was brought in and left for two more days and the brakes were said to have been adjusted and the oil was changed  The Brakes shrieked on the way out of the dealership driveway Then  it rained for one of the first times in months  probably the first heavy rains my Focus had seen because the Southeast is in a drought  I went inside the parked focus to get something off the floor and everything was wet on the front passenger side  There was a steady stream flowing from behind the glove box  The focus was immediately take to the dealership where it was purchased  The service advisors were extremely rude and unhelpful  laughing that it would be 9 days til the car would be fixed for the leak  I left the vehicle in their hands anyway  in order to fix the squeaky brakes again  On my way out i spoke with the dealerships GM  who is one of my clients  and he flat out lied to me that he had not heard of such leaks  even though the service advisors admitted receiving several cars with such leakage I picked the Focus up three days later to find the brake pads replaced and still squeaking  the leak problem not even addressed  and the car with only 4100 miles on it  Later that day we discoved that not only would the Air Conditioning not work  but the mechanism would not blow air out either  Several days later the sad little vehicle was taken to a different Ford dealership where it would remain for Ten days straight  During this period we requested a loaner or rental car and were laughed at  Ten days without a car is a LONG time  believe me  When the Focus was picked up from the dealership it had had the leak sealed  the AC unit completely replaced  and the Brakes replaced  The Brakes continued to squeak and shriek  Two or three weeks later came the recalls  that I have still not been notified of  but have verified by calling Ford Customer No Service  The Brake problem continues  When I reach 12 000 miles the pads no longer are covered and I am told that ford is developing a new Focus specific brake pad that will not squeak  But will they develope and install these pads at no charge On top of all this there are the little things  1  The trunk does not fit into the body of the car properly 2  There are about 6 12 parts floating around the floor of the car that have fallen off and have no aparent home 3  We found lose and unattatched bolts under the hood that must have been forgotten at the factory Otherwise  this might be a good car
