  S ince late 1985 when the Ford Taurus first was shown at autoshows around the world  it was almost an instant hit  people loved this aerodynamic  concept looking  car with no front grille  Finally  in 1986 the Ford Taurus went on sale  along with its sister car  the  Mercury Sable i Driving Impressions i  My tester  1990 Ford Taurus   unlike the 1987 models came with a more powerful 3 8 liter V6 as an option  Actual horsepower specs are the same between the 3 0 OHV Vulcan and the OHV Essex V6  but unlike the Vulcan it reaches its 140 horsepower at a much lower RPM  and instead of 160 lb ft of torque it has a more impressive 215 lb ft  The 3 8 is fuled by multi port fuel injection and is a pushrod design  This engine is found in a multitude of Ford  Mercury  and Lincoln automobiles  first seen in the Ford Thunderbird as a base engine  The 1990 Ford Taurus still has the same AXOD 4 speed automatic transmission  but since 1989 it has larger fluid lines so ATF can lubricate vital parts more efficiently  You will notice that the 3 8 compared to the OHV 3 0 models that acceleration from the light is much quicker  hills are a snap  and cruising is hushed  At 70 MPH the 1990 Ford Taurus 3 8 is cruising at an aprrox 2 100 RPM  With the 3 0 it was a higher 2 800 RPM  For 1990  4 engines are available   the base engine is a 2 5 liter that produces 90 horsepower  This may not seem like a lot  in fact it s not  but it does not do too bad of a job moving this car around  the 2 5 4 cylinder was dropped in 1992  There is the Vulcan V6 3 0 liter which produced 140 horsepower  found in all models  and the 3 8 which is found in the GL and LX models  There is also  since 1989  a new engine by Yamaha  which is a 3 0 liter DOHC V6 engine that produces an impressive 220 horsepower and 200 lb ft of torque  this engine unfortunately can only be found in the expensive SHO  super high output  models i Interior Innovation i  The  interior  of the 1990 Ford Taurus is almost all new for this year  The dash is totally changed from its predecessor  and is much easier on the eyes than it once was  Ergonomics are very simple and easy to use  The LX model I drove had power everything  including leather power seats  with power lumbar support  6 speaker premium Ford sound system which sounded excellent for a stock system of this time period  and manual keyless entry  One of my major gripes with the 1990 Ford Taurus s interior is the lack of bucket seats  Instead Ford uses a split bench front which aids in more seating  however results in lower levels of support vs a bucket seat design   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks almost exactly like it did back in 1986  very little exterior changes have occurred since introduction  The paint has improved over the 4 years  and the rear tail lights look more modern  Back in 1990 this car was still ahead of its time  GM still had its boxy Buick Century  and other boxy family cars  but they were starting to get the hint that Ford had something going with this whole aerodynamic theme  In fact this style was so adored  in 1990 the Ford Taurus was the best selling car in America i Pricing Reliability i  These cars go for very cheap today  the Ford Taurus has terrible resale value  But for those who need a car  but don t have a lot of money  this is good news  This car can be found for around  2 000  The only problem is  is that the 1990 Ford Taurus has a reputation for being a lemon  I personally have never owned a 1990 ford Taurus  but I did own a Mercury Sable for over a year with the same powertrain  and it had loads of problems  including  transmission bands breaking   lots of money to fix  starter problems  alternator  fuel pump  power steering pump   lines  new struts  wheel bearings  and a few other things  The headliners on these cars are awful  Since this is almost 2003 most of these headliners are already ripped  you most likely will be hard pressed finding a  90 Taurus with a mint condition interior i Final Thoughts i I do not recommend the 1990 Ford Taurus  however if this car is a  must  on your car shopping list  I can t stress enough how important it is that you take it to a professional mechanic  These cars have been known to cause their owners a great deal of misery   Other Cars To Consider i 1  Honda Accord b 2  Chevy Lumina  a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a   My Review b 3  Toyota Camry 4  Buick Le Sabre 5  Dodge Dynasty 6  Plymouth Acclaim 7  Chevy Corsica 8  Chevy Beretta 9  Nissan Maxima 10  Nissan Stanza Happy Car Shopping
