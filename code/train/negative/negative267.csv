 I bought a 1997 Ford Ranger to make a 6 500 mile trip from Alaska to the East Coast  I had made the same trip two years before with an 1987 Chevy S10  I got much worse gas mileage on a the Ford  which was 10 years newer  Also  the Ford would not handle the same mountains that my S10 had no problems conquering  I have not enjoyed my Ranger  because my Chevy ran and handled much better  and was 10 years older  I will never buy a Ford again  I recommend Chevy S10 for peace of mind on a long hard journey br br
