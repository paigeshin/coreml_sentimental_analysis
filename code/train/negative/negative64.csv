 I purchased my 92 Ford Taurus in 1999 based on my loan officer s opinion of what size loan I could handle  Obviously  he didn t figure the maintenance costs into that estimate  In less than twenty four hours  literally  I found myself stranded on the side of a major highway  screeching into a pay phone that  yes  they most certainly would send a tow truck  The water pump was shot Over the next seven months I got to know my mechanic very well  The transmission nearly fell out from under the car  and did manage to crack the planetary   planetary what I haven t a clue  but it cost  1500 to replace  Soon after I also replaced the heater coil  window motor  and the air conditioner   twice  in southern Mississippi you have to have the AC  I hitched a ride to the mechanic so many times that I honestly can t remember every thing that had to be fixed or replaced During the last month of my ownership the transmission began slipping  again  and the wiring went completely nuts  I honestly don t know a single person who has purchased a used Taurus  of any year  that didn t have major problems with the car  The car is very comfortable  and a dream to ride in  but you can never assume that you reach your destination  They re just not built to survive more than a few years br br
