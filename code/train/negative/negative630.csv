 I bought this vehicle for the room that it has  Seats 7 with extra room in the back for anything else you need to carry  What i learned and know hate about this vehicle is the sliding door  I have had the door into ford a least a dozen times in the past year  The top roller on the door pops out and the door is just hanging there  It makes it unable to close or open properly  It would seem to me that this should make the car unable to be drivable but as long as they fix it and it runs a month before it falls off again then it s ok  In the mean time it is a pain and a hassle  I would think that they could bond it or make it fixed permantly  but that does not seem to be the case  Beware drivers who are thinking of buying a mini van with a slider Just had to take it to the shop march 8th 2000  the hinesville ford department and the body shop that they contracted have finally told me that there is nothing else they can do  They have replaced everything on the door except for the door itself  Now what do I do  I have to carry a cresent wrench with sockets every where I go My warranty has expired Now  and they have made sure that I have gone over the miles that they warrany there work  Basically I got taken big  I want to warn every owner  Make sure you get paper work for all the work that is done  Even if there shop fixed it at there expense  It is the only proof that you ever brought it back to there shop If any one has a suggestion please leave me a comment  If you know how to get out of a contract let me know I still owe 2 more years of payments on this vehicle br br
