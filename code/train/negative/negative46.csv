 I bought a 1994 Tempo after my Hyundai XL completely died  It was one of two Tempos on the Ford lot  and the only two cars in my budget range  I was in college and working two part time jobs  I purchased the extended warranty for almost  3000 and never used it  which was stupid because the seatbelt motors went bad after I had the car for a week  so my automatic seatbelts wouldn t work and made loud noises trying to work  I just didn t have the time to go into the dealership because I was in classes and working constantly  Needless to say  they are still broken  and it probably wouldn t have been covered anyway  My extended warranty only covered major body work  It worked fine right up until the point that my extended warranty ran out  Of course  I wasted  3000 and I still have nearly  3000 to pay on the loan on a car that isn t worth  1500  The driver side window has to be manually forced down  and the driver side rear window squeaks when being rolled down  Another con is that the back windows only roll down half way A couple of months ago  the gas tank started leaking  At first  I could smell the gas  and once  my friend witnessed a couple of gallons just pouring out into the gutter  I took it to a repair shop  and they told me that nothing was wrong with the gas tank  but they did find out that my rear right brake needed work  That wasn t a surprise  My brakes had been causing me constant squeaking and grinding problems for over a year  I thought that my brake problems were solved  Yeah right  Previously  I had paid over  400 at Midas to get them fixed  and they ended up worse than when I took them in  I took them back  and they reported that there was absolutely nothing wrong with them  My brakes make constant noise most of the time  but that day  they chose to remain quiet after I took it in  Anyway  I told the repair shop to fix the brake  It cost me over  200  and I couldn t tell that there was a difference when I took it back  Since then  I still have bad brakes  and while I no longer smell gas or witness gas leaking  I get about 10 miles to the gallon  My car has begun to make a rattling noise  and the trunk catch is broken  I have to tie my trunk down  I m a student  and I can t afford a car that causes me constant problems  I ve heard about other Tempo owners who were constantly paying to repair brakes  Shops will tell them that there is nothing wrong with them until the brakes have been damaged so much that the whole system needs to be replaced  There have also been numerous reports about gas tank problems and cars catching on fire because of leaks  I m not repairing anything on this car  I m getting rid of it  The only other good thing about it is that it has a lot of trunk room and plenty of back seat space  Not that I get to use that space  No one wants to ride in my death trap
