 Ford Explorer has taken a lot of heat in the media of late It is a great product and has been the mainstay of the Ford line for a few years now  From time to time Ford has tried some improvements  With the media after them relative to roll overs and Firestone tires  I guess this was the time to really give Explorer a new look There was a problem finding stashing places  Where do you put the maps and the pocketbook and the wrench and those little items most of us carry around with us When I got in for a test drive the salesman pointed to the door and said here is the spot for your water bottle  Well  my fifty something neighbor down the street never leaves home without her bottle  I must be the camel in the neighborhood  I was not impressed  Unfortunately I discovered that little curve meant I had less leg room  The caddy in the center console has a crazy useless configuration in my 2000 Ford Explorer  There is a definite improvement in the stashing capability in the redesigned console  But then the seat is smaller  Since 2000 my butt has gotten bigger and the Ford Explorer seats have gotten smaller  That is where all the hidden space has come from They have a car like riding truck  I had no complaints with the old ride  But now my mother in law will not have to be hosted up into the passenger seat  The Explorer is closer to the ground BUT my husband cannot ride in the front seat  The height clearance inside the cabin is lower  He hits his head and the man is only over six foot not seven foot The Explorer is wider on the outside  but not on the inside  With narrower  smaller seats all those stashing places are useless  I cannot fit comfortably inside with all my stuff By the way there are also extra seats in the back  Great for car pooling  That is if the members of the car pool are kids  It is not seating for adults  There is no leg room  You have to climb in like a amusement park ride to get back there  I would never ask an adult to do so  especially if I was picking the crew up at the airport The ride is great and I am sure the reliablity is as good The visibility out the front window is also affected if you are an average sized person
