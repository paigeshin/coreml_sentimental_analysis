 My first car for college is likely to be the last Ford I will ever own  Driving the Ford Tempo is like being behind the wheel of a death wish  By the time I had gotten rid of the vehicle I had experienced all of the following Replaced a CV Joint Lost my Gas gauge and Odometer  well it was still there just dead All interior lights malfunctioned Blinker arm fell off Driver side door failed to open from the inside Driver side Seat back went into a state of constant recline Had scalding hot water dumped from the heating coil onto my foot   I ve never taken a shoe off going down the hi way 70MPH so quickly in all my life Lost A C Lost Heater Lost Defrost  in a snow storm I might add Lost the Muffler The Tie Rod snapped on a curve at 50MPH causing the wheels to be perpendicular to one another consequently ripping the tire off of the wheel near death experience  I could have reached out the window as I was flying through the air and written my name on the near by telephone pole  before I landed in some farmers field Ball Joint snapped  looked like the wheel had decided to take nap  This was repaired for free the mechanic said after 6 repairs your 7th is free  Radiator Problems Don t buy this vehicle  I repeat Don t buy this vehicle  Don t take a free Tempo  After repairs its extremely expensive  I d call it a million dollar car br br
