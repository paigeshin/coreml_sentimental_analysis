 I loved my  99 Explorer XLT for the first 2 months  Then we went back and bought the SUV we d originally intended to buy  the  99 Expedition  There are 3 main reasons why I traded up to the  99 Expedition Eddie Bauer  drivers seat comfort  cargo space  and highway noise  I began to realize that my back really was hurting every day and suddenly it dawned on me that my beloved new SUV was the culprit  I was driving about 70 miles a day  quite a haul I agree  but I had never experienced back pains like this after driving  The driver s seat is not comfortable for a 135 pound woman  Even with all the ergonomic gadgets adjusted  the pain was still there  As I had previously owned a compact  the Explorer was huge at first  Then I realized something  There s not as much cargo space as the brochures lead you to believe  If you re a mom like me  a lot of  quot stuff quot  gets carted around daily  Strollers  car seat  diaper bag  etc  Add groceries or plants from the nursery and there is no room for folks  My mother and father could not ride comfortably in the backseat during a visit  even without all the junk  and this was frustrating for everyone On the highway  we found ourselves turning the radio up higher only to notice that on regular streets  we were blasting ourselves  There is a lot of outside noise in the Explorer  much less than the Expedition So  we made a painful decision  Take the loss and get another SUV that will really fit our needs  We ve owned the Expedition for a month now and LOVE everything about it except the locks that lock automatically when you step on the brake  seems pretty cool until you realize how often the passenger hops in and out getting mail  checking on baby one last time  fetching diaper from back  etc  and I m still working on getting into a parking place on the first try but that s another story br br
