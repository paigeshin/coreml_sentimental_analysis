 I remember the day my parent s came driving into the drive way with this piece of work  Granted I didn t own a car at this point  but something told me the Tempo was a bad buy To begin with there was no tape player  while this was only a small problem the fact that the speakers were rather cheap and would blow if I attempted to play a song at a loud decibel The basic scheme of the Ford Tempo  in my mind  was to build a cheap car that resembled something sporty  However  along the way they seemed to forget that people have a way of remembering if a car breaks a lot To begin with the electronics that kept track of the fuel  shorted out after about two months  when my parents went to return the car so it could be fixed they were told it would cost in excess of  500 I had heard from a friend of mine that the car was pretty much just a piece of trash that breaks every 15 seconds  but I could not believe this  How could the makers of the Mustang and Thunderbird possibly make a lemon I had decided that the gas gauge was merely bad luck and one of those unexplainable things  but a short while later when the alternator went I began thinking differently  For the record we replaced the alternator three times  and eventually just gave up on the car and bought something else My friend bought a 1988 Escort about a year ago and the transmission and seat belt motors went  and presently my friend Josh has a 1995 Escort that makes strange noises that are suspicious  Perhaps  it s time for Ford to stop trying to bring out new models like the Focus and work on the lesser ones like the Tempo I d give Ford a B  or A  for the Mustang  Thunderbird  and Probe  but a C overall because of the Tempo br br
