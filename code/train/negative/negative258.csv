 MY EXPERIENCE I test drove a 2003 Focus LX sedan at a local dealership  My test drive lasted about half an hour  and consisted of winding secondary roads and the freeway  PERFORMANCE The Focus has many strengths  but straight line stomping is not among them  The engine in the LX model that I drove was among the weakest in the budget sedan brigade  putting out just 110 horsepower  Although acceleration felt adequate around town  the Focus felt decidedly flat footed on freeway on ramps  even when I wasn t pushing it  When I floored the throttle for maximum acceleration  the sensation was akin to driving through deep sand and the engine wasn t very quiet about it  either  Most car magazines have quoted the LX s 0 60 times around 11 seconds  which isn t awful  but places it among the slowest brand new cars  To be fair  this relative lethargy is less pronounced in other Focus trims that aren t all that much more expensive  For example  the SE gets a 130 horsepower engine  along with a CD player and other useful niceties  for a little over  1 500 more  That trims the 0 60 time down to a more reasonable 9 5 seconds or so  and although I haven t driven a Focus with this engine  it s likely to add a measure of confidence in freeway merging that the LX model was short on  TRANSMISSION CLUTCH The Focus  transmission shifted well enough  but lacked a precise  mechanical feel that would have made it fun  The shifter finds the gears accurately I never missed a shift but it has long throws  and its action feels mushy  Similarly  the clutch engaged very smoothly  making it nearly impossible to jerk the car during gearchanges  but it had a long throw and engaged way up at the top of the pedal travel  which made for lots of left leg aerobics when driving around town  STEERING HANDLING The Focus fares much better in this area  Its road manners have a distinctly European feel to them which comes as no surprise when you consider that the Focus was designed in part by Ford of England  with the European market in mind  Its steering was firmly weighted and responded quickly  with a solid  decisive feel that inspired great confidence on twisting roads  There was also an unusual amount of road feel coursing through the wheelrim  an unusual quality in a low priced car  and one that allowed me to intuitively judge how much grip was left when I was driving hard on a twisty road  The steering feels just a touch squirmy on center  but is otherwise second only to the Mazda3 s for feel and precision  The Focus s soft suspension allowed quite a lot of body lean in hard turns  which was unsettling at first  but once I learned to trust the Focus s chassis  I found it a capable handler with plenty of grip in reserve on winding roads  Two thumbs up for European driving priorities  and their positive effect on the Focus s excellent dynamic qualities  RIDE Another impressive quality of the Focus is how well it rides  Usually  agile handling cars make some noticeable sacrifice in ride comfort due to their stiff suspensions  but not the Focus  Its ride is quite soft and absorbent  soaking up bumps and ruts quietly and without harshness  Damping is a bit on the soft side  meaning that the car bobbles over dips and humps in the road  but most of the time it simply swallows the bumps without disturbing passengers  As mentioned before  the engine isn t all that quiet  but road and wind noise are pleasantly muted  INTERIOR The Focus s interior isn t perfect  but it competes very well with the best in class  There was a surprising amount of room inside  both front and rear  and space was especially generous overhead it felt like I could have worn a ten gallon hat while seated  if I was for some reason possessed to do so  All the Focus s controls were easy to see and use  and while they didn t operate with the well oiled silkiness of the Corolla s or Civic s controls  they were easily superior to the crackly switchgear in other domestic alternatives like the Chevy Cavalier and Dodge Neon  There has been a good deal of griping about the Focus s front seats in the automotive press  but I found them plenty comfortable during my test drive  And while the high  upright driving position wasn t to my liking  I can imagine many buyers would love the commanding  minivan like view of the road it provides  There were only two notable caveats in the Focus s cabin  One was the materials  which were predominantly cheap  hard plastic  detracting from the sense of quality  The other was the distracting styling of the dashboard  where numerous slashing curves and unusual angles competed with the road for my attention during my test drive  PRACTICALITY I ve already mentioned the expansive interior  but it s worth mentioning again as it adds a considerable measure of practicality to the Focus from the inside  it feels like a much bigger car  The trunk is also quite spacious for a small car  and a standard split folding rear seat makes it all the more flexible  For further utility  buyers can choose from a five door hatchback style  the ZX5  or a conventional station wagon  While I haven t driven either of these models  their behavior should be identical to that of the sedans  while adding a measure of cargo hauling ability and uniqueness  RELIABILITY Ah  here s the rub  The Focus is quite a good little car  but according to Consumer Reports  its reliability is Much Worse Than Average a fairly scathing criticism  And while this is purely anecdotal evidence and far from conclusive  one of my friends who bought a Focus recently would certainly agree with CR s findings his water pump broke twice in one week  stranding him out of town for days  OVERALL So frustrating I really liked this car in nearly every respect  and yet I can t give it my recommendation  Although it s a fresh  modern design  and its road manners are fun and engaging  its very poor repair record was more than enough to temper my enthusiasm  and I simply can t give the Focus the nod with a clear conscience  As good as this car is  there are others  like the Civic and Corolla  that drive just as nicely and aren t nearly as likely to give you problems  A new car should give its driver total peace of mind  and that s something the Focus may not be able to deliver
