 I first drove the 2001 Windstar as a rental in Orlando this January  I was quite impressed  It had a smooth ride  convenient features  and easy handling  So  when my husband switched to a job with a car allowance the next month  my vote was in  I did lots of internet research to find out what model we wanted  what the price ranges were  etc  We settled on a very nicely equipped model and found one for  600 under invoice and 3 9  financing  So we went to pick it up  Things went relatively smoothly at the dealership since the deal was already worked out  However  I was still there for over five hours  Anyway  about the van   Good Things   COMFORT  The Windstar has a very smooth ride and nice handling  It is very easy to drive and comfortable to ride in  It is so easy to get into that even my two and a half year old son can climb in by himself  The seats are comfortable and the driver s seat has great adjustments  The interior is generally roomy and cupholders are everywhere  SAFETY  All five of the rear seating positions are equipped with tether anchors  The van is equipped with flashers on the side mirrors and cornering lamps  The flashers on the side mirrors also flash whenever one of the sliding doors is open  warning others that a child may be about to dart in or out of the vehicle  Windstar has dual airbags and very good crash ratings  All the doors automatically lock when the vehicle is put in drive  There is even a sensor that is supposed to let you know if the tire inflation is incorrect  CONVENIENCE  When the rear seat is removed  the back will accommodate a full sheet of plywood  a real plus when you have to prepare for a hurricane  The keyless entry system comes in handy when you are juggling groceries and a toddler  The sliding doors always work smoothly  You can usually put just about whoever and whatever you need to into this van   Bad Things   PROBLEMS FROM THE VERY START  When we tried to install the cargo net  we found that one of the knobs was broken  The first time my husband removed the rear seat he discovered that there was a missing knob  When he took the van to the dealership  nearly 60 miles away  they did not have all of the necessary parts to fix it  He did not want to make another trip out to the dealership for something they had already had two opportunities to get right   so they said they would mail the part to us when it came in  We got the part alright   the WRONG one  This has yet to be resolved  A few weeks ago the battery was COMPLETELY dead for no apparent reason  Upon recharging it has been working fine  Right now there is already some sort of front end problem  The steering wheel makes a strange clicking noise when you turn it  All sorts of unexplained sounds have come and gone in the short time we have owned this vehicle  It is ridiculous In a nutshell   I will be glad when Saturn puts out a van
