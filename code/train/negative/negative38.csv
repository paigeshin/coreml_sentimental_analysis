 I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic  interior  power  warranty  options  etc  points of view  I believe an important  but always neglected area  though is from an undercar point of view  and let me tell you  most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear  There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there  but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion  and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision  If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles  I hope to help you decide based on my experience  which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of  and reliability of  one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole  the steering and suspension system  The Ford Tempo was for years  one of the most popular cars on the market  It sold very well  and there were Tempo s everywhere  Suddenly Tempo s weren t all that hot an item any more  There are many good explanations for this  and one of those I will let you in on right now  The suspensions on the Tempo were exactly the same as was on the Ford Escort  absolute junk  Having the constitution of the United States on my side is a very good thing  because there is not one redeeming quality about the suspension of the Tempo  and if they could the Ford Motor Company and it s engineers would sue me for telling you this  First off nothing is greasable on the Tempo  and the tie rods  both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate  as do the lower ball joints  The design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack  down to the steering knuckle  and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface  The smaller the area the faster it will wear  that s just basic physics  And that is exactly what happens  If the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted  there would be more surface area contacted and it would not wear as rapidly  But now it s too late  they are committed to mass production  Even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part  the name s still the same  rapid wear  The lower ball joints are another sore spot  Not greasable and prone to rapid wear  The ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm  so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm  This includes both the bushing on the strut rod  and the inner pivot bushing  This could really be a good thing though  because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint  but if you don t need bushings you have no choice  and at over 125 00 each retail  it is an expensive repair to replace both sides  There are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the Tempo too  like strut mounts and bearings  but suffice it to say I am not at all recommending any of you to consider a used Tempo  it just isn t worth it  Even if you got one really cheap  and got all of the front end parts replaced with lifetime warranty after market parts  they will wear out due to extreme angles of operation  And even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase  and receipt from the garage you got it done at  the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one br br
