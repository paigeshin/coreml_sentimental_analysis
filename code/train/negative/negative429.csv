 I have never owned either a Chevrolet Camaro or a Ford Mustang  My opinion is based purely on my sporadic drives   Mustang My first impression of the Mustang is that I see it on the street WAY to frequently  Everybody and their brothers  aunts  grandmas  cousins  and co workers has on  Who would want to buy a car that everyone else has  Not me  How am I supposed to show off in a car that everyone else has  The second thing  that really drives me crazy  about this car is the way it receives so much kudos for being more comfortable  Sports cars should not be judged on comfort  If you want comfort  buy a Buick  Sports cars should tear up the race track and leave two black lines down the middle of the streets  The constant praising of the comfort on this car being better is really quite moronic  Sure comfort helps  but sports cars should be judged on the length of the black strips left behind  o  The Mustang is a nice looking car  I do have to say that it looks slightly better than the Camaro  It s a bit boxy but it still wins this battle  The stereo on this Mustang just really sucks  There is no other way of saying it  This stereo is a senior citizen s stereo in the way that it has little bass and needs to be cranked near full blast before it can satisfy a music lover  I guess they re pairing it with the  quot comfortable interior quot  to please their family car buyers  They definitely aren t pleasing the sports car enthusiast who wants to go tearing up the hiways with the tunes bumpin  On to the driving  I found that this car drove quite nice  It s pretty fast  can turn well and do all of the stuff that a real sports car can do  I didn t go test either cars sporty ability since the cars weren t mine to mess with  But from what driving I did do  it seems to handle nice and provide a pretty good ride  Uhh I think the only other thing I  being someone who doesn t own one  can say about it is that the interior components look old  They are the same dials and stereo systems that used to be in the old F 150 s back before they changed to their space ship design  The components all seem functional  they just don t look flashy at all  The Camaro s aren t a whole lot better  but they still are better   Camaro  I will talk about the same things in the same order with maybe one or two additions  This car is not near as common as the Mustang  I might see one or two a day  and when I do  it s a treat  Put on some shiny rims and flowmasters in this baby and your bound to get some attention  There s not as much competition to compete with  This car is less comfortable than the Mustang  but who cares  The front seats are fine by my standards for two people to go wherever they want to go  The back seats aren t too roomy at all  but sports cars don t need back seats  These seats were probably just designed to give grocery bags added comfort  o  But really  comfort is not a huge factor in buying a sports car  Your in the wrong class of cars if that s what your looking for  Even though the  Stang gets the kudos for looks  I still think the Camaro is a nice looking car  It does need an update  but it is still a really nice looking car  The SS version is extremely attractive  The Camaro majorly wins the stereo battle between the two cars  This stereo is comparable to the stereo I had specially installed in my Yukon  It is really an awesome stereo with a ton of bass and enough volume to lift you out of your chair  A definite pro in my book  Driving both of these cars was a different experience for me because I was used to a big Yukon but the  Stang s driving position was a little higher which made it easier to get used to at first but the Camaro s was just as good once you got used to it  When you drive a car that isn t yours  the driving position is always a little wierd  The Camaro is one fast car  I had the chance to open the throttle to this bad boy and boy did it move  Amazing  Braking was good on both  The Camaro s handling was a little better  I think  Just my opinion though  Everybody s different  I loved listening to the exhaust sound in this car  In the Mustang you just hear the buzz of the engine while in the Camaro you hear the roar of the exhaust  Definitely awesome  The components in this car are functional and are more modern than the Mustangs  These components are logically placed and easy to use  Gotta love that stereo  If I was to buy one I would probably buy a Camaro because they look so awesome when they are fixed up whereas the Mustang s start looking a little unearthly  as nearly all of Ford s vehicles do  With Camaro s you can get more for you money  so I ve read in Motor Trend and just about every other auto magazine out there  Once again  that stereo might make the decision for me though  It would save me a few thousand of having to upgrade the Mustang s  Oh  and an addition on the Camaro  you gotta love those T Tops  What a compromise between a convertible and a coupe  They are really cool
