 I have a Ford Explorer Sport and I know I am going to get some flack for writing this epinion but I feel I must voice my epinion anyway  I have read many other epinions about the Ford Explorer and many people seem to love this SUV I however would never ever buy another one The vehicle is very attractive looking roomy quite comfortable and not that bad on gas BUT the construction is extremely poor  My doors  quot dropped quot  because the hinges were made so poorly  The inside door panel and handle construction is so poor that my handles actually broke off just from regular use which in turn caused my inside door panels to crack split and then break altogether When I take the vehicle out of 4 wheel drive I am instructed to back up a bit to totally disengage the hubs  What is that  I don t see other people backing up all over the place to do that  This can t be right but if I don t back up I hear crunching and grinding and I don t dare drive it What a poor system  I was told by the service department that this was normal for the Ford Explorer though and that I need to backup My ABS system doesn t work properly either and I have had times when I wasn t sure I was going to be able to stop for school buses and such  I found this to be a very scary experience Now I get a recall card in the mail saying the rear door  hatch  hinges are poorly constructed and could be dangerous  NO KIDDING I have 4 years left to pay on the piece of junk and wish I had never bought it  If I could get out from underneath it I would in a heartbeat I would not recommend the purchase of and Explorer to anyone and would never consider buying one again I have dubbed mine the Ford Exploder I consider it one of the worst vehicles I have ever owned br br
