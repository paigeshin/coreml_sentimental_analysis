 I purchased two new Ford Escorts in 1996  One  a manual transmission  for my daughter  The other  an automatic  for myself  The price  looks  Sunrise Red  handling  safety and comfort were perfect for us  They both are 2 door  hatchbacks with alloy wheels The driving has been smooth and comfortable  The Escorts  operating cost has been minimal  I have not had any problem with the engine of my automatic  My daughter has had an overheat light that comes on and had to be repaired twice  The light was a false alarm and the car never overheated Both of us have had problems with the vehicle speakers  One or more speaker had to be replaced in my daughter s vehicle  This was not too suprising since she was in her early 20 s when we first got the cars  My left front speaker fizzled last spring and needs to be replaced  My daughter had a speaker and radio on order which still hasn t come so she bought her own and replaced them This is the biggest problem we have had with the cars  Parts covered under warranty are taken off taken out and put on order and we still don t have them  There was damaged plastic molding on the side of my car which needed to be replaced immediately  It took a couple of months to get the piece so it could be replaced Both cars have had speakers on order since last spring  My daughter has played taxi to the city of Minneapolis so her car has more than twice the mileage on it than mine does  They are still running well without major problems It is a good  quot kid car quot  The Escort takes a lot and keeps on driving  A good solid car for a little economy which will pile up a lot of miles without repair
