 I honestly can t complain about the engine or transmission or any other major component of my 1997 Taurus GL  It has always gotten me where I need to go and has always started up in the morning  etc  However  about 2 000 miles after my 36 000 mile warranty expired  all sorts of things started to go awry  First  the passenger side window  automatic  of course  stopped rolling down  The driver s side went soon after that  And  now  none of my windows roll down  When you get into the car  the little light showing that a door is ajar remains on along with the dome light and all other interior lights  It s quite embarrassing driving down the highway at night with your car lit up like Times Square The parts  from what we have discovered  are only available through Ford  which means big money  So  my husband messed with it until he got a couple of the windows working  I m still waiting for the dome light to go out or the battery to run down first  I m anxious to trade this baby in before anything else happens br br
