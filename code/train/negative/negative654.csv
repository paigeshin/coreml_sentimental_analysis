 Leased a 2001 Ford Windstar LX  maintenance package  daytime running lights  safety package  etc  We really want to like this vehicle but the number of irritations makes it impossible  Soem are the quality of the vehicle some are dealer together they generate a very bad ownership experience First it is a Gas Guzzler  13 MPG dealer  Ford of Upland  CA  says so what  The electronics are sloppy  the Auto Mirrors  Seats  and Day Running Lights Don t Work  The Memory adjustments for the seats and mirrors reset to neutral every time you hit the unlock button  Dealer says   Just reprogram  why have memory if you have to adjust them each time you get in  The day running lights generate an error on the dash that must be canceled to view mileage etc  every time you start the van  Air conditioner makes a loud clunk when you first turn it on  Poor controls on the onboard video system  Seats are very heavy and hard to get in and out  Purchased the regular maintenance package on the basis of Oil Change is same as Quick Lube Service Our first oil change we had to leave the van for 5 hours  FORD has very poor quality control over dealers Our 4th FORD Van with each FORD has gotten worse   our last
