 This car looks good   REAL good I had a handsome  red model on a long term hire from a dealership in San Jose  when I was working there  and it certainly turned heads when I cruised down Stevens Creek Boulevard on the way home from work   especially on the occasions when I was giving a lift home to Lucy  a rather gorgeous blonde co worker of mine However  appearances aren t quite everything  and the 1997 Mustang isn t quite as good as it looks  in performance terms at least Put it this way you don t want to take it drag racing The acceleration is really quite poor  It is unresponsive to the throttle  and was embarrassingly beaten to the punch at the lights by several vehicles which could hardly be described as  sporty Having said that  the mid range power is much more pleasing   there seems to be plenty of  oomph  under the bonnet when you put your foot down at 40 50mph  However  another gripe I had was the sluggish handling  Again a fairly minor consideration  but it did lack the  nippiness  that I have always associated with a good sports car However  these are only minor irritations  In conclusion  this is still one cool car  The performance isn t great  but when it looks this good  it s pretty easy to forgive Still  I feel that if you are looking to buy a convertible  then better performance may be found elsewhere Still fun to drive  though br br
