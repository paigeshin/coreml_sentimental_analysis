 If this car was an actual human  instead of zero to sixty  she would be doing ten to twenty for attempted vehicular manslaughter    quot Vickey quot i  is the unoriginal  informal name that my 1991 LTD LX earned  Before I describe the attack  here is the  quot fun stuff quot   What s under the hood b This matrix grilled  built like a tank  rear wheel drive  body on frame Ford is massive  Accordingly  the power plant is larger than most engines in cars on the road For those of you who do not know what a 302 5 0 EFI V 8 is  let me explain  for those of you who do  please skip to  the next section    quot 5 0 EFI V 8 quot i  means this engine is suitable for Mustangs  and cop cars  EFI means electronic fuel injection and V 8 means it is one the biggest engines on the road  It is the same engine that is in a Ford Mustang  and everybody knows that these are not slow  Police require cars that can catch even the fastest of automobiles  and this is why many police departments choose the Crown Victoria as their squad cars   The next section  I will try to get all this technical information out of the way so we can get to the good stuff  The following sections are for people who are thinking about buying a 1991 Crown Victoria   or a Mercury Grand Marquis and for people who have this large barge  Knowing that for most people who are reading this neither apply  I will try to keep it as brief as possible  However  I do have an abundance of information that I will try to shoehorn between now and the attack b You look young for a grandfather b The 1991 model is the last of the old school Crown Victorias  The more contemporary model arrived in early 1991 as 1992 s  You have seen the ones I am talking about  they look like a mixologist put a 1991 Crown Victoria in a blender with a Taurus  giving it a more rounded off appearance  The previous generation before the 1992 s had not changed that much in looks since 1979  yes the late 70 s  I feel this has a causal effect on the company grandpa car image that this car has  The split bench seats perpetuate this image b I see  in your past  problems when ordering at the drive through b Would you like some information that is very useful at cocktail parties  Any Crown Victoria owner  all models up to 1999  has probably had problems with the power windows and I am no exception  However  I fixed it myself  so I can give you additional information that others cannot  The power windows use a nylon spool that breaks and tangles around the regulator and motor inside the door  The local Ford dealer wanted  250 to fix my drivers side window  so I fixed it myself with a part from an extra door  see  When Cars Attack  section  This was a hassle  but creates less anxiety than handing a cop your licence and insurance information through the back window  not to mention talking to customs when driving to Montreal  do it through your back window  and you are sure to be asked to  pull to da side  Now  if you meet someone at a cocktail party with a Crown Victoria you can magically predict that they have had problems with their windows b Jiffy lube this  buddy b Vickey had greaseable upper control arm bushings  This is a nice feature  however it is really hard to find a service station that will do it for you The wheels must be turned to access the zerk fittings  meaning two more steps for the people who service your car Make sure that someone does this at least ever two years  at the absolute most  or you will have an expensive repair b Other problem spots  For every single mile I put on this car  80 000  I had problems with the EGR passages  EGR stands for exhaust gas recirculation  which sounds good on paper  but means big problems for people who have to get their exhaust checked upon inspection  EGR runs your exhaust back through your engine to burn some of the pollutants that otherwise would be released into the air  and if it is not working  you will not pass emissions The air conditioning uses R 12 refrigerant which is no longer being manufactured  It is still available at a current rate of  25 30 per pound  To recharge  five pounds of R 12 is utilized You do the math  it isn t cheap Neither is the alternative  You can convert your Crown Victoria to the new R 134A refrigerant at a cost of  200 300 which includes parts and labor Other problems include  but are not limited to  the alternator and the windshield wiper pump  not to mention the imprecise suspension  Vicky consumed alternators like a monkey eats bananas For the love of God  if you have this car  track all parts you buy for it  It is a good idea to ask to see the used parts  on any car  before work starts on it  even if you have no idea what the part is b Use the force  Luke b Being from Vermont  it is hard not to be a red neck when dealing with cars  but it is a constant battle  As you can tell  sometimes the urges are too strong to win the altercation  That is why I installed a K amp N air filter in my car  This is a highly crafted air filter that is reusable  Just wash it  oil it  put it back in  and enjoy the extra horsepower you now have  In retrospect  this was a sound investment  I also installed  underdrive pulleys  in my Crown Victoria  which replaces the water pump and alternator pulleys with ones that  underdrive  several of the accessories  freeing up engine horsepower  I know you are thinking this is why I had to replace the alternator often  three times  however two of them happened before I made this adjustment  so I ruled out this assumption After these two simple adjustments  I realized I did not need to change the muffler to a high performance one  as so many people do when trying to get more horsepower out of their car This car was very fast  advancing from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 10 seconds before the adjustments and 8 seconds after  However  the acceleration of this car is more noticeable at highway speeds  where these adjustments had the most impact  On the highway this car is a bad boy b When Cars Attack  I know your eyes are getting blurry  and if I haven t lost you so far  I thank you for reading Please let me conclude with this story  After calling AAA once my car would not start  they sent a tow truck to tell me some misinformation  He said it was one thing  and I found out it was another problem  down the road  I found out the complication the hard way  It was a bone chilling morning  10 degrees  in Vermont  and I went out to start Vickey so she could warm up  and I could get my things together inside the house I started the car  got out and shut the door The previous night I pulled up close to the garage  so I had to walk behind it on my way inside  Just as I did  the reverse lights illuminated and it lunged toward me  As I jumped to the side  it slowed down enough for me to open the passenger side door I realized the wheels had been turned to the left  making the car continue to come toward me  After I opened the door  my self preservation function kicked in  and I decided to spring away and I watched as she drove down my driveway I cannot describe the feeling of watching your car drive without a driver  Just as Vickey completed a 90 degree angle  the passenger side door caught on a metal fence  twisting it to touch my front quarter panel As it scraped along the diamond metal fence  it straightened out and proceeded to travel down my driveway Just imagine the next time you start your car  what would happen if you turned your steering wheel all the way to the left  shifted into reverse  and let go of the break  Now  picture what would happen to someone if they happened to be standing to the right side of your car  As I watched Vicky drive away  sparking along the fence  she slammed against the last metal pole on the fence  and with a brief upward motion  she rested at her final destination  To make things worse  I had just replaced that door after getting broadsided  with no injury to my passenger  by a Grand am  I put the original door on it after pounding it out  and sold it at auction for  200  Good riddance
