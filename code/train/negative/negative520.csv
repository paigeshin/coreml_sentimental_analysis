 My family bought a 1995 Ford Taurus GL sedan back in  96  when the car was only a year old  At the time  the car was in excellent condition  with low mileage  and a clean interior However 4 years later  the hands of time have taken their toll  Our Taurus is now pushing 100 000 miles  and the car is definitely showing its age  and then some This particular model is a bare bones vehicle  I think it may have once been part of a rental fleet  Power is delivered by a wimpy 3 0L V6  which even when new produced a measly 140 horsepower  Most mid size sedans of its time easily eclipsed its power output  Now  five years later  it seems even weaker than before  The engine is mated to the standard transmission  in this case  an electronically controlled 4 speed automatic with overdrive  Ford transmissions are not known for their crisp shifts  and this one is no exception  The term  quot slushbox quot  never seemed more appropriate The entire car is tan  Not that there s anything wrong with the paint  in fact the paint quality is quite good  it s just so drab  This car s one asset is that it s invisible in traffic  Unfortunately  it s also invisible in the parking lot  especially considering that  95  if I remember correctly  was the year Ford Taurus out sold every other passenger car in the States  Thank God they weren t all tan The interior is  to its credit  pretty comfortable  The front split bench seat is comfortable  but my tastes lean more toward buckets  I also prefer a floor mounted shifter as opposed to this model s column mounted shifter  but it wasn t my choice  so I m stuck with it As I ve said  the car is showing its age  The engine has lost most of its pickup  what little it had in the first place  and the fuel mileage has dropped  The transmission s shifting has gotten even sloppier  if such a thing is possible  and the seats have lost most of their comfort All in all  if you re going to buy this vehicle  do yourself a favor  and find one with a better trim level br br
