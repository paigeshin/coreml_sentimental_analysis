 I am writing this because of a difficult experience I am having with the Ford Ranger pickup truck I recently purchased from Peyton Cramer Ford  in Torrance  California  After this involvement with Ford  I will never buy from or recommend Ford Motor Company for the duration of my car buying days The reason for my dissatisfaction with Ford is a result of a mechanical problem with my truck that has not been repaired  In short  the truck has an extremely rough  sporadic shake in idle  I returned to the dealership with the Ranger the day after I purchased it and I spoke with the service manager  He acknowledged the problem  and advised me the shake could be caused by water in the fuel line or carbon in the engine  and to bring the truck back after five hundred miles if the shake did not go away  After five hundred miles  I brought the truck back to Peyton Cramer where it was serviced  Another service manager  advised me the CAM timing  pertaining to the California Emissions System  was the cause of the shake  and it was a normal condition of the vehicle  I was not satisfied with the diagnosis so I took the car in for servicing with two other Ford dealerships and received two different diagnoses for the shake  I left both dealerships without a repair and contacted the General Manager of Peyton Cramer Ford  about my situation  After speaking with Howard Herman  I brought the truck in for servicing at Peyton Cramer  and left a second time with this issue being unresolved  I contacted the Ford customer service hotline   they are helpless  and I was told to contact my dealership again  and the regional office  So I did I get a call from the Ford Regional office in Los Angeles and they said they are reviewing their records and that they have determined that Peyton Cramer Ford could not replicate the problem with my Ford Ranger and that it is a normal working condition of the truck  This is after I brought it to the dealership four times  every time the dealership  Peyton Cramer Ford  acknowledges the shake  accepts the vehicle in for servicing  and then after not being able to find the problem  denying that there is a problem in the first place I have yet to determine the real problem  however  I brought my truck to two independent mechanics  These mechanics were able to evaluate and judge that there was a problem with my truck by taking a visual survey of the truck shaking  Both have stated and recommended that there is problem with the truck and to take it back to the dealership where it was originally purchased  I am completely dissatisfied with my Ranger  not only because of its mechanical problem  but also because of the great inconvenience and frustration I have suffered due to Ford s lack of responsibility  The truck s condition is below the reasonable expectations of a new owner ALWAYS TEST DRIVE FOR AT LEAST 15 20 minutes on various road conditions  even with a new car  If you do end up getting a Lemon  Ford will tell you to eat it b To see more problems with Ford  search the internet with the words  Ford Secret Warranties b This review tends to focus on the negative aspects of the Ford Ranger  If I didn t have the mechanical problem with this truck  I might be happier with it s overall performance  Before I bought this Ranger  I had an F 150  When I moved to Los Angeles I decided the F 150 was too big to be driving around a city  so I went for the Ranger  The maneuverability and size convenience is there  and I lowered my car payment  easy to park and move around on the smaller streets  The ride is a bit more smooth than the F 150  however if you do hit a bump the ranger tends to bounce around a bit  I have noticed that with all the Fords I have driven   I have owned three in my life  Taurus  F 150  Ranger  I am a larger person  so I have been a bit squished in the Ranger  If you go with this truck make sure it has power windows  because it s hard to drive and roll up the window at the same time  Also make sure you get the Supercab with the four doors  it makes all the difference in getting in and out of the back seat  However if you have kids or carry people around in your backseat frequently  I don t recommend this truck because of the way the seats face sideways with your back to the outside  If somebody was sitting in the back  and there was ever a side collision  the people in the backseat could loose their spines  I don t carry many people often  so I just use the backseat for carrying extras and locking things up in the car I have also found that the gas mileage is lower than what is reported on the sticker  It truly gets about 16 18 mpg rd hwy  If you go to the message boards on Edmunds com  you can see this is a repetitive problem with the Rangers The engine power I feel if fair  I have a 3 0L  I can make it up a hill without downshifting most of the time  however it does not accelerate well uphill  My F 150 had the smaller engine  and could not make it up a hill in fifth  I always had to downshift so that I would not loose speed Beside the constant earthquake in my car  and the fact that the Ford Customer Service reps and my Dealer have shafted me  the Ranger LOOKS very pretty  I have silver  Good Luck in buying this truck
