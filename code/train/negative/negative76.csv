 Two years ago  I had been dreaming about owning one of those monsters I had been seeing on the roads  The Ford Expedition  I love big Trucks and this one had just come out the year before  It looked classy  sporty and aggressive at the same time  So I went SUV shopping  I drove the Durango  the Isuzu  and many others  Many but the Tahoe  I cannot tell you why  Maybe it was just the shape of it  it looked old  They had remaind he same for years  a big rectangular box on wheels Well  I ended up leasing a brand new 98 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  I live in the South East where it never snows and I don t have time to go off road  so I decided to save money but getting the 2WD  This truck just has everyhting on it  Awesome 7 speaker stereo  power everything  6CD changer  turning signal integrated in the mirrors for aded safety  lit running board  third row seat  automatic lights  leater seats  power driver seat  etc  It is very very roomy expct for people seating in the third row seat  but let s not be too demanding  It  quot seemed quot  luxurious and safe and so big  i loved it  we had taken the 5 4 liter V8 whihc I Highly recommend considering the size and weight of this truck  The standard 4 6L has a hard time moving this truck in and out of traffic The 5 4L is powerful and is enough  However  it is noisy  When you pus the pedal down the cabin fills with noise and it is quite disppointing for 36k luxuary car  After driving this truck for a year  and driving other cars and SUVS  I quikcly became more and more disappointed  What I thought was luxury  was just a facade  Plastic elements are of poor quality and are poorly assembled  There are too many large gaps betwee dashboard elements and doors  etc  Second disappointment  after the excitment of buying the Expedition was gone  was the lack of torque and power  Drive an expdition  then a Tahoe  and you ll understand what i am talking about  The Chevy powerplant is a lot more powerful and efficient  it ll let you spin the wheels at a red light  The expedition is more like an  quot Escargot quot  Third and major disappointment is the ride mainly over bumps  holes  and the handling in curves  You might not realize it as a driver  but seat on the right side a few times and it ll become obvious  I was wondering why my wife kept comlaining about my driving  The truck bounces you all over the places when turing  braking a little hard  or drivig on older bumpy roads  It also tends to lie on its side when turning  A 36 0000 dollar luxury SUV should not bounce you so bad and force you to hold on tight ot the door handle and the dash board  unless you wnat a work out i do not feel as safe driving it now I have since driven a TAHOE and ridden in a SUBURBAN  the engine is a lot more powerful and adequate for such a car  and the ride is a lot more comfortable Finally  I will end saying that in a year I had to take my Brand New 36k Expediiton to the shop twice  thre parts broke in the sunroof  10 days without a car and the Auto Air Valve broke Make sure you ride the Chevy trucks before giving up to the good looks of the Expedition  and to the image of driving one Good car hunting
