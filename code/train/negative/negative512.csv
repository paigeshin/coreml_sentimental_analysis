 When I was in the market for a new SUV  the new 2001 models were just coming onto the market  There are few things I love about this vehicle  although the things I do like are major  The offroading abilities of this car are average  It has front and rear independent suspension  allowing for a nice ride on the street  but sometimes not the best choice for offroading  However  the car is short  The negative thing about this is that it limits your cargo room  which I must say  is extremely limited  The escape is almost undoubtedly safe  as Ford s reputation goes  Now for the driving  The Escape s steering is not quite that of a BMW  but its ok  The pickup  however  is above average  DO NOT BUY THE 4 CYLINDER ENGINE  It is unbelievably slow  and it is pitiful that Ford would even try to get people to buy it  The more fitting SUV for this size is the Mazda Tribute  the Escape s twin  I prefer the tighter suspension  and quasi nicer interior  Consider it over the Escape  In conclusion  the Escape is OK for a person on the market for the average in compact SUVs  and it is more of a car anyway br br
