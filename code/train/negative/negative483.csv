 I was not in the market for a new vehicle  but my son was  He asked that I go with to look at the Ford Expedition  It didn t take long for him to realize he could not afford it  However  while looking with him  I fell in love with the Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition  of course and  behind my son s back  went and purchased one  Sitting behind the wheel of this humongous vehicle makes me feel like the Queen of the Road  The smell of the leather  all the modern conveniences  the sense of power one gets from controlling this huge animal and all the envious glares from on lookers makes one feel on top of the world  However  I soon learned that the cost of the vehicle  as high as it is  would only be a fraction of what it would cost to drive and maintain this animal  Unless you have money to burn  and a smaller vehicle for your everyday running around  I do not recommend this vehicle  After putting only 6 000 miles on mine  I was fortunate to sell it just as gas prices began to soar  I am now happily in a 28 33 mpg small car br br
