 I was lucky enough to get to drive my best friend s 2000 Ford Contour SE for a week  and then drive it from New York state to Georgia  I was pleasantly suprised with the overall performance of the car  It felt very solid  but was obviously not well built  The entire top of the dashboard is peeling up near the base of the windshield and it looks awful for a 40k mile car  Also  the small pod that houses the power window switches on the driver s door feels very cheap and flimsy  When you press one of the buttons  the whole pod wiggles and creaks  as if it is going to fall into the door if you press too hard  I was not impressed with this  However  the car feels and sounds very solid overall and I was impressed The engine and transmission performance is questionable  but not terrible  The engine is snappy from a start and is powerful enough on the highway  However  due to it s small displacement of 2 0L  it is weak on hills at any speed  I also think the engine is a bit on the buzzy side  It idles buzzy and is buzzy when revved up  which it likes to do a lot  Overall  I think the engine is a good balance of performance and fuel economy at around 32mpg on the highway  The transmission  although silky smooth  is a slow shifting dog of a tranny  The shifts are very lethargic in nature  The tranny shifts very slowly from gear to gear  This can become a bit annoying in stop and go traffic when the transmsission up shifts even though you are already applying the brakes  I realized that pushing the  overdrive on off  button to keep the car from shifting into overdrive helps the excessive shifting alot The front seating is very supportive with great bolstering to keep your tushy from sliding around during cornering  I was really expecting my butt to be sore by the end of the 17 hour drive  but it wasn t  I also find the driving position to be very comfortable as well The stereo is a decent standard system  Nothing too bad or too great  just adequate  The controls on the stereo are standard issue tick tack size Ford stereo buttons that can be a little tricky to use while driving  The speaker performance seems a little weak  but not horrible  As far as the appearance of the car inside and out  I think it s an attractive car  although I prefer the front end styling of the previous design Contour  I love the rear end styling  It s attractive  simple  stylish  and looks like it belongs on a much more expensive car  The interior is modern  attractive  and functional overall  I like the dashboard used on the Mercury Mystique better though My only major concern with this car is the overall reliability  The trannies rarely last more than 100k miles  These cars are also plaugued with electrical bugs  Good luck to anyone who owns one  Overall  it s a very well designed car that was poorly executed
