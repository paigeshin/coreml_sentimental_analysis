 First of all  I would like everyone to know that this is my first time in epinions because i want everyone to know what problems we ve been having wih our 99sel We bought the van last jan 99 my mom was suppose to get an odyssey minivan but we had to wait for about 3 to 6 months which we should have done It is actually my mom s van she s been really taking good care of it  15 months only 8000 miles It s been to the dealer a lot of times with different problems  first one we noticed blemishes on left rear behind the sliding door  no quality control noticed a big blemish like that which was impossible to miss The dealer where we got the van had it brought to a bodyshop no problem with dealership they were nice  amp  helpful it took about 2 days then we got it back that was fixed then the electronic display on the van was reporting that there s a charging problem so we goback to the dealer it was the alternator  so now they have to replace the alternator so this was solved  And now the biggest problem THE AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOOR one day it just wont shut tight it closes but it opens up a little bit on both doors so another visit to the dealer they adjusted it so it was ok for a while Then it started doing it again so back to the dealer they adjusted it again now it got worse you could hear it scratching something inside the railing so now were up to the point of getting tired of this problem  Now they are gonna change the two sliding doors if it  s still not fixed then I think it is a lemon Because I think this vans were the first batch to come out that s why it has all this problems  onna have to call ford soon br br
