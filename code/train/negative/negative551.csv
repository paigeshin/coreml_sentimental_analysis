 I bought my 1996 Ford Escort in January 1997 with 9 000 miles on it  I drove it with only minor problems until this last year  Over the course of the last 6 years we regularly maintained it  changing the oil every 3 000 miles  The speedometer broke with around 25 000 miles  but was still under warranty  The AC went out on us in early 2001  The cost to repair it was outrageous  but fortunately a mechanic asked if it was a dirty plug  connection  or something  which it was  so the problem was fixed for around  60 The interior is fairly comfortable  The cloth seats held up well  Rear speakers stopped working after the second year  Instrumentation is easy to read  however  the  check engine  and  check coolant  lights came on at random times and after numerous diagnostic tests at around  70 dollars a pop  we learned that they just like to do that  Leg room is sufficient although we are fairly short people  both under 5 10  My husband always had to drive with a travel pillow behind his lower back on long trips  but I was fine  We definitely wanted to stretch after a few hours  The paint on the rear bumper is faded  Gas mileage was fairly good   we got around 30 mpg on the highway  unless the AC was running and then that sucked it down much faster  If you have children  know that the AC does NOT reach the back  even though it s a smaller car  Our baby was always bright red even with it going full blast  And while the AC is on  you will not be going over any mountains  We turned off the AC then because the car felt like it was straining We replaced the windshield twice  150 each  new tires twice which are NOT a standard size and so are much more expensive  between  55 and  75 each  and a new front and rear engine mount  200 Now as to why I am writing this review  In July 2002  the same month we paid the car off  it stopped in the middle of traffic while my husband was coming to the airport to get us  At 86 000 miles  regularly maintained  the car needs a new motor  The cost to purchase a used motor will run around  3 000  A new motor will cost  5 000  After speaking with several mechanics  Ford dealers  etc  everyone has told us that the cost to repair the car is more than it is worth  Yes  it is  We are now without transportation  with a toddler and one on the way  We did not expect to be in this situation for years based on the reputation of Ford  But we are  No trade in value  no chance to sell it  no car  Everyone says  that s so unusual  they don t normally do that  Well  mine did  I would recommend staying away from Ford Escorts  Replacing a motor at 86 000 miles is ridiculous  We will not be buying a Ford again
