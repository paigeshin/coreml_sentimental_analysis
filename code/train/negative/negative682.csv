 I never really drove a Ford until my car got smashed and i needed a rental  I rented the Focus SE  i had no choice  It has the 110Hp sohc engine which sounds pretty nice  Personally I dont like the styling both interior and exterior  It is too crazy for me  The exagerated wheel arches and the odd shaped tail lamps just dont do it for me  Something plain and simple such as a Corrolla or Protege is what I like  But if the car had other things to offer i may be able to live with it  but it doesnt  It is slow  I couldnt believe how slow the car was even though it was an automatic  When pinning the gas pedal the transmission seems to get confused  It takes a while for the gears to change  and its not as crisp as it should be  However  cabin noise is very minimal and the ride is smooth  When turning somewhat agressivly the tires chirp  Making a right turn at 40kmh is all you need to get them chirping  Oh yeah  visibility is poor too  Even more so at night  Fit and finish is poor in my opinion  Things seem to be loose and not properly assembled  The car i drove had 20000 kms on it and already the interior dome light was burnt out and the mirror adjuster was broken  The car doesnt feel solid at all  Maybe this car was just assembled poorly  Or is it the design  I sure hope they make them sturdier in Europe because the American built ones just feel like they are going to fall apart br br
