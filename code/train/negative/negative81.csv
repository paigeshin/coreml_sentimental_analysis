 We used to drive down the road and be jealous of all the people who were driving the NEW style Mustang so when we could afford one we bought it  It was sitting in the back lot  it was white and all the dirt had settled on it from sitting  With the shortage of mustangs around we were thrilled to find one but we couldn t figure out why it wasn t on the showroom floor  They didn t have any convertibles on display  only hard tops  It seems that South Florida is the place for convertibles year round and that s what we wanted 21 000 later we had BRAND NEW Mustang convertible 6 cylinder  white top and white paint grey interior and 350 miles on it when we drove it off the lot  We were thrilled  it was our Christmas present  Eight days after we purchased our NEW car it was a rainy New Years eve and I saw the car parked by the school 4 miles from home and nobody was in it  I thought someone had stolen it  A policeman drove by asking why the car was there  he thought it was stolen Walking in the rain was my son and he said the car let out with a bunch of steam and the engine quit  So we had it towed to the dealership and they were closed but when they looked at the car they told us we did something to make this happen  But we didn t  They had the car for almost a month and a factory rep came down to look at it and there was a factory defect in the engine which caused the engine to blow  I wanted my money back and they said NO  A new  21 000 car and a blown engine  That could effect the transmission etc  They did give me  1200 back for the extended warentee but they let us keep the warentee  That was a deal  We had the car for 15 months and a humming in the middle to rear of the car started  It got worse  There was also a vibration with it too  We took it in many times anf finally I found out there was a defect in the torque converters and Ford was keeping it hush hush because they didn t have enough torque converters to replace it on all the cars  I didn t want the car  Luckily we live in Florida with the Lemon Law and we got back EVERY Penny we paid for the car  I was thankful for that  I felt FORD made it good so I used all that money and ordered a new 1998 Mustang convertible laserred 6 cylinder  We felt it was a fluke that we had problems with the first Mustang The second Mustang we did eventually have problems with the torque converter but the dealer said there was nothing wrong with it  That s another story  See my write up about it and my 2000 GT
