   Disclaimer i  Attempts at a detailed analysis  based on the intensifiction of the fight between the two giants  Call this bitter battle between these two giant companies whatever you want  Call it the battle of the sturdy CEOs  Lampe and Nasser  John and Jacques  The battle of the cream of the creams  You may even want to call the breakup of relationship a divorce of Ford Motor Co from Bridgestone Firestone  All of this has come after numerous fatal accidents and recalls of tires by both companies  The victims have filed lawsuits in the meantime  In what ways will this public battle benefit regular  poor and suffering consumers  Their loved ones are long gone  No camp appears to take the blame for the lack of safety and the shredding and peeling of tires in last year s series of accidents  One of the protaganists seems to say something that includes the consumers whose heart  money and business both camps are looking for  There may be some grain of truth to this statement by Bridgestone Firestone president John Lampe   Business relationships  like personal ones  are built upon trust and mutual respect We have come to the conclusion that we can no longer supply tires to Ford since the basic foundation of our relationship has been seriously eroded b Which side to believe  How about consumers  safety in all of this b i Ford Motor Co CEO fires back    We are deeply disappointed that Firestone decided not work together for the safety of our shared customers  which is the only issue that matters  Despite all the shots fired back and forth  consumers become spectators of this major disagreement  They are taking lessons  They want to know which side is truly interested in protecting them  giving them the assurance of safety on the roads  After all  they are the ones who buy the various Ford Explorers on which the Firestone tires were mounted  Jacques Nasser decides to recall close to 13 million more Firestone tires on its SUVs  It has already made plans to replace the Firestone Wilderness AT tires by signing a contract with Goodyear  All of this news leaves John Lampe with no other alternatives other than to ask for an inquiry of the Ford Explorer  This news is nothing but positive for the consumers and the plaintiffs of various lawsuits  If anything wrong is found in the Ford Explorer design  they will be able to use this new information against Ford  On the other hand  Ford CEO Jacques Nasser wants to continue believing that all the problems lie with the tire manufacturer   John Lampe does not understand why his company s tires fair well in other vehicles  but not on Ford Explorer  He admits that this company is prone to rollovers  This may explain why he is asking for an inquiry  He has taken steps making sure the proceedings get under way i  At that point  Mr  Lampe met with transportation secretary Norman Mineta and submitted to him a pretty long report about Ford Explorer s steering problem that may have contributed to rollovers Ford is blaming on defective tires   For sure  the battle has intensified  Still  the questions that most consumers are asking are  How safe is the Explorer  How safe are the tires b What has been known in this conflict  a  The federal government has files linking Bridgestone Firestone to 174 deaths and more than 700 injuries  Based on these data  it appears that Firestone had no other games to play other than to be forthcoming and cooperative to save its skin  We all know how last Summer  Bridgestone Firestone agreed to recall 6 5 million tires that the government linked to the previous deaths b  Ford has a lot of ammunition against Firestone  And Firestone has a lot against Ford too  So much for the 95 year relationship that saw the marriage of blood and flesh over the years  Plaintiffs of lawsuits filed against both companies are paying close attention to the tidbits of info that fall on their laps  Who would not jump on them c   Important features despite all the rumors   Ford Explorer has been a best seller  It is one of the Ford s lines of vehicles that has had some great returns over the years  Most consumers continue to buy them despite the existence of its competitors as found in GMC Jimmy  Chevrolet Blazer  Jeep Cherokee 2WD and Jeep Cherokee 4WD  The 2001 Ford Explorer comes with air bag driver  air bad passenger  side impact door beams  theft deterrent system  window  driver side Express door etc and all the standard features While this breakup may be a catalyst to many plaintiffs  lawyers  grin  what remains to establish to end all doubt is whether Ford Explorer is all that it s cranked out to be  It will be up to the inquiry team to answer this question  John Lampe can t answer it himself  Let s hope that the truth  the whole truth will come out without any problems  The public  the consumers are watching  They have already paid with the blood of their loved ones  They are suffering while they recover from last year s flurry of peeling tires accidents May the truth come out  This way  if any defect is found in the vehicle  it may be corrected to save lives on the roads  As far as the tires are concerned  let s hope that more whistle blowers come out like Erin Brokovich  It is said that Alan Hogan has been the Erin Brokovich in this case  May he continue to serve society and the regular Joes with his moral values  We need more people like him around  Don t you agree
