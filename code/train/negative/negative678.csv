 Driving a Ford Focus Rent a car while mine is in the shop  At first I was thrilled to have the chance to drive one of these cars  The reviews in European Car and Car and Driver Magazine led me to think it would be a very pleasant experience  Much to my dismay I had forgotten that rent a cars are bottom of the barrel in features  What I fast discovered was that although a functional car  the base model with an Automatic transmission leaves worlds to be desired  This is an econo box pure and simple  The transmission is not at all smooth  acceleration is either hardly there or JERK SHIFT slam you into your seat and in your face  though I think the slam you in your seat feeling is more from the abrupt transmission than from the raw power provided by this little 4 banger engine  Interior space is limited  With my daughter in a child seat and my seat pushed back to a comfortable distance  I m only 6ft  she can easily touch the seat backs with her feet  no way you could get two adults in the back seat of this thing  The trunk is small as compared to my 1992 Jetta  but the low liftover height and the fairly square shape  make the space very useable Fit and finish seem quite good  better than many GM rent a cars I ve experienced I expect that the uprated car with a stick shift would be quite pleasant  since even with all the negatives about this base model  a little bit of a well designed  fun to drive car keeps peeking through  I hope Ford has the gumption to bring the even hotter models from Europe to the U S  with a hot engine and a better tuned suspension I could be inclined to overlook the unusual appearance of this car  I guess in the end this is a fairly well sorted car esp  for the money  however  it still can t compare to the fit and finish  quality or fun to drive quotient of the Europeans  I think the premium paid for a VW is well worth the  br br
