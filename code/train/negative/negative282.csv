 An American legend After rented a 4 door Mazda for one week  I was ready for something more powerful to drive around rough highways in the Los Angeles area during my business trip  What did I rent  A 2 door 2001 Ford Mustang which came with standard options such as dual airbags  cruise control  power windows  CD player and A C  In addition to those standard items  the car had a traction control  This I was impressed to find the traction control  which definitely helps to reduce the chance of losing control of the vehicle under bad weather conditions Performance Basically  there are two different models for 2001 Mustang  The normal Mustang comes with a 3 8 liter V 6 engine with 196hp  The GT models come with a 4 6 liter V 6 engine with 260 hp  Because I only drove a non GT  I am sure that GT performs totally different from my review  As soon as I stepped on the pedal  I knew that I chose the right vehicle to drive around the highways of the LA area  I could not compare the way the car accelerated with a 4 cylinder sedan  Despite the fact that the car accelerated very fast  the noise from the engine was not annoying at all  I no longer felt scared when I was merging onto a freeway   People were flying on a merging lane  As a trade off to the fast acceleration  the fuel efficiency of the car was not so good  Based on my rough estimate  the car drove about 25 miles per gallon  However  this is not so bad for a V 6 with 196hp  Comfort The driver s side seat was quite comfortable  However  the suspension system of the car seemed to be not working as nicely as a regular sedan  like a Toyota Camry  Basically  the suspension system does not absorb shocks very well  However  this seems to be a quite common symptom for a sports car  The inside space of the car as well as the trunk space seem to be larger than earlier models  This is definitely a big improvement from 80 s Mustangs  Design Compared to Mustang s long time competitors like Camaros and Firebirds  Mustang definitely made a great improvement of its design and image  While keeping its identity as a traditional American sports car  the current Mustang body was designed based on the first generation Mustang  this car looks classier than ever  I guess I am not a big fan of those bad boy looking cars like Firebirds and Camaros   Believe it or not  Marketers for those cars target those people who are attracted to a bad boys image Overall  I really enjoyed driving this car on the highways in the Los Angeles area  With this powerful 3 6 liter V 6 196 hp engine  this car definitely drives very well on those rough highways br br
