 While our instincts told us not to buy this vehicle  we did anyway  We bought our Windstar and sold it 3 months later  I believe Ford makes a good product  but this in my opinion is not  Our Windstar rattled  and just felt cheap  Having drove a Jeep SUV before the Windstar I missed sitting up high  and didn t feel as safe in the Windstar  It was easy to move around  but had no sportiness or fun when driving  I have driven other minivans that I felt were of a much higher quality than the Windstar  The carpet stained easily and was hard to clean  Just not a good buy in my opinion  Dawn
