  The 1992 Ford Taurus  was now in its 2nd generation  many car companies for 1992 had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic  so Ford had to do something to stay on top in the style department  Unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look  The 1992 Ford Taurus  while improved in some areas  never made it past 1st base in other areas   The 1992 Ford Taurus  is not much different than the 1991 models  the 2 4 liter  90 horse powered engine is finally dropped  but there still is an anemic 140 horsepower 3 0 Vulcan V6 as its base engine  The 1992 also weighs more than its predecessor  tipping the scales for the first time over 3 100lbs  The next engine is the Essex 3 8 engine  It too has 140 horsepower  but unlike the Vulcan 3 0 it gets all its power at a much lower RPM  and has more torque  215lb ft  The top of the line engine is the 3 0 DOHC engine that was built partly by Ford  and mostly by Yamaha in Japan  This engine cranks out an impressive 220 horsepower  and will burn rubber if you don t watch your right foot at a stop light  This engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line  SHO  models  and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year  The AXOD transmission still  after thousands of complaints  comes in the GL and LX models with the OHV 3 0 and 3 8 engine  Ford obviously did not listen to their customers very well i Driving Impressions i   T he LX equipped with the 3 0 is what most of the critics called  anemic   boring  and just  plain sad  this lack of power problem was obviously an issue that I did not share alone  This car not only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid 1980s  but for 1992 it s even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power  The 1992 Ford Taurus  of course is not a race car  however shouldn t  acceleration  onto the freeway at a decent pace be a standard amenity in an almost  20 000 family car  I think so  Remember  when these cars were new they were not exactly cheap  some LX models were as much as  21 000  a good engine  with adequate power is not asking too much  is it  My Test car  a 1992 LX only had 82 000 miles on it  but felt like it had much more  There were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors  the carpet was worn  the back seat had tears in the cheap leather  This car looked as though it had been through the war  There was even a time while accelerating up hill that the transmission totally slipped out of gear  I had to shift to neutral then back to D  After letting off of the gas pedal  the transmission let itself go back into high gear  and I resumed my way up the hill at around 45 MPH on the freeway  very dangerous when the speed limit is 80  but I had no choice i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  is not too bad  I ve never personally been in a 92 Taurus when it was brand new  lets see  in 1992 I was around 14 years old  But I can imagine what this car probably looked like  The leather probably looked plush  the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants  and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin  that s me trying to be funny  Anyway enough about probably s  this car is now 10 years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk  The interior does boast tons of room  trunk room included  There is 6 way power seats with lumbar support as an option for the LX  leather  a cold AC  an optional electronic dash  electric antenna  5 MPH bumpers  front air bags  finally  ABS is an option  The 6 speaker Ford sound system probably would have been good  but it didn t work so I can t comment   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks much like the 1st generation s  The rear looks a little more square  there is modified tail lights and head lights  body colored bumpers and door handles  more attractive stock rims  and paint has been revised so it doesn t wash off as easy as the previous 1st generation models  When I say  wash off  in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation Ford Taurus i Price i  The  price  for a 1992 LX Taurus will cost you around 3 000 dollars  In many cases these cars are being given away  or close to it   Other Cars To Consider b i 1  Dodge Intreped 2  Eagle Vision 3  Chevrolet Lumina  a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a   My Review 4  Honda Accord 5  Toyota Camry 6  Chevrolet Corsica 7  Plymouth Acclaim 8  Dodge Dynasty 9  BMW 3 series 10  Ford Thunderbird  Happy Car Shopping
