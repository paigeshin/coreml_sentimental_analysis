 In December of 1994  I was 16 years old  I was a newly licensed driver  and was looking for a car that was economical  reliable  and most importantly  safe  The 1994 Ford Escort seemed to fit the bill perfectly The car I picked off the lot was a four door model  The color was bright  neon green   The correct name of that specific color was  quot Calypso Green quot  Such a color really appealed to my teenage self at the time  It did not include many options  but it did include air conditioning  cassette player  and power mirrors  When I pulled of the car lot with it  I was a happy camper One day  about six months later  the trouble began  I had been driving the car all day  and it had been running fine  I stopped at a store for a few minutes  When I came back out again  it simply would not start  When you turned the key  nothing happened  No sound  not even a click  My brand new car was towed back to the dealership and was discovered to have a dead cell in the battery  The battery was replaced  and all was well again At about 15 000 miles  from under the hood came a loud  annoying chirping noise  As it turned out  the fan belt was frayed and needed to be replaced  It was found to be odd that the belt had gone bad at such low mileage  Upon further investigation  the pulley that operates the fan belt was found to be defective  Both the pulley and the belt were replaced A few months later  at about 20 000 miles  the car would not start again  Once again  it took a ride on the tow truck to the dealer and was found to have a defective ignition module  Luckily  the warranty was still in effect  because that would have been the most costly repair of all  about  500 600 The car is in pretty good running condition now  and I hope all of the kinks have been worked out  Currently  the speedometer cable makes an extremely annoying chirping noise at low to moderate speeds and the temperature gauge does not work If I could go back in time  knowing what I know now  I would not have bought this car  I can only hope that others have had a better experience than I have br br
