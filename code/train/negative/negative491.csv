 When it came time to replace my well worn 1987 Jetta  I wanted a hatchback  and the most logical choice was a Golf  Apon seeing the hatchback version of the Focus  however  I decided to up the list of consideration to 2  After test driving both cars  I found the Focus was by far the better deal  and walked out of the dealership with a brand new 5 speed 3 door hatchback  with the racy sounding zx3 badge  with a c  alloy wheels  cd stereo  and  rather useless  fog lamps for  3000 less than a Golf with only a c  The focus is a great small car  on driving alone  it is by far the best small car offered in America  the interior wouldn t be out of place in a luxury badge  the car is pleasent to drive  very quiet even at highway speeds  My only complaint  a car this size should get even better gas mileage  though it averages about 29 mpg highway  in city driving it can be much lower  this with the 5 speed standard transmission  not much better than the pinto ford built almost 30 years ago  A few months of living with the Focus and I was sure this was the best economic choice I had ever made Then came the recalls BEginning with an axel related problem  i ve had 2 announced  and 2 pending recalls of the focus  WHile the dealers are quick to correct the situation  having to make a special trip and arrangements  both recalls required leaving the car all day  with no loner  was not what i expected from a new car  In addition  The car has refused to start 3 different times and stalled out once  the dealer is clueless as to the source of the problem  I ve had the Focus for over 2 years now  and am approaching the end of my warranty mileage  and wonder if I ll be put in a situation where I have to dish out my own money to fix future problems  That said  having driven friends vw s  honda s and saturns  the focus feels like a car in a higher price range than these  but it lacks the problem free nature these cars seem to have  Advice  Buy with caution  the 2003 models offer a 100K warranty
