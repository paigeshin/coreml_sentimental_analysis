 So there are a ton of reviews about this car saying it is the greatest  Well it is  But I m still here to burst your bubble  It has problems  I personally own one  it s a  93 Ford Thunderbird LX with 80 000 miles on it  I love it but it doesn t always seem to love me back  Recently it has been having problems with the thermostat on the engine  You may say   quot No biggie  it s only a  10 part that can be easily replaced quot  and you d be correct  It is  However it keeps on breaking  The problem is not the thermostat  because I have tried different brands  many with lifetime warranties  and they still keep on breaking  Still no biggie but it regulates your engine s temp  and you don t want it over heating  Also  every once in a while the spark plugs will miss a step  causing the car to shake  Many say that the engine put in these cars is the worst one Ford makes  But I m not sure about that  Anyway  have fun with any car you choose br br
