 I bought the 2000 Focus SE sedan model in Feb  2000  in April 2000  there was a recall on the injector pressure sensor then in Aug  2000  the car has what the dealership has termed a  quot lean skip quot  related to the transmission  which they state is  quot normal quot  for the Focus  which in laymans terms is a hesitation and bucking in the vehicle in 2 3 gear  which is not normal for any vehicle  Now in Oct  2000  there is another recall for the left wheel bearing which 15 cars have lost their wheel off the vehicle while driving  There have also been two other little things this car has had for trouble  the rear trunk release doesn t always release from inside on the first try  and the gas gauge also did not register a couple of times a full tank of gas minor in comparison  however annoying nonetheless  I would not recommend this car  wish I could sell mine and find something better some car of the year over here  maybe the European ones were better  however  ours aren t  I am very disappointed in the vehicle br br
