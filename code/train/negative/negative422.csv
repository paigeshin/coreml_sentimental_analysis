 I own a 1996  5 speed  v4   gl version of this car  Happens to be green  the most popular color  I think  so be sure you know where you parked Mine does not have all the bells and whistles  I was looking for a reasonable priced family car  and that s what I got  Safety features  It has a full body crash frame  a nice safety feature I hope to never use  I did not get the abs brakes  I don t happen to like abs  It comes with dual front airbags  the passenger side cannot be turned off  which I wish it could  It has some feature that will drop the engine out in a major crash  also not tested Exterior  Green  aluminum wheel covers  molded bumpers  nothing special Interior  Light gray  green illumination lights  Okay  why do they make automatics with a tach as standard equipment but it s optional equipment for a stick  This has always bugged me  Controls are laid out fairly well  They didn t load up a lot of features on the stalks  which is nice  One side is the wiper controls and the other is the lights  Cruise controls are on the steering wheel at thumb height  Can t stand the rest position for hands at 4 and 8 o clock  the new recommended  safe  position  Horn is still in the center of the steering wheel  but you gotta push hard  Air heat controls nicely laid out  well lit  air is good  heat takes a bit of time  I replaced the factory stereo but the speakers are ok unless you re an audiophile  all four in the doors  It has a cubbyhole under the stereo for expansion or storage  4 cd s fit ok  Hard to get into in 3rd or 5th  Next to the emergency brake is a retractable cup holder  Only holds medium size to go drinks or 12 oz cans  sometimes tips  Two map lights plus a 3rd light with door open delay timer in the center front  Large glovebox  shallow door pockets for both front doors  Adjustable height restraints are nice  Rear has two shoulder restraints and one middle lap belt Features  Power windows  Work well  rear go only to child height  child lockout  Power mirrors good  Remote entry  About worthless  you have to practically stand at the door to get them to work  even with brand new battery Problems   this will take some time  get a drink  Okay  first the latch that releases the fuel door has never worked  I often have to go out of the car to pry it open  can t wait until the day I can t refuel  The knob that adjusts the tilt of the front seat is hard to reach  hard to turn  The direction controls for airflow break really easily  flimsy brittle small pieces of plastic  The back seat is shallow and uncomfortable for anyone over 5  tall  The middle back seat restraint is NOT SUITABLE for a carseat  trust me on this  The dead man foot rest is awful  This year model did not come with the split rear seats  a MUST for all cars of this type and a HUGE oversight on the part of Ford  A rear seats that fold down  even the whole seat  is necessary  and this one could have sure used it  The engine temperature gauge constantly shows the engine as almost in the red  Dealership told me this was  quot normal quot  and they showed me a Ford white paper about it  The engine is LOUD  and if you don t have the radio on you ll go nuts  This is by far the most annoying thing about the car Assets  The front seats are comfy for the short in stature  Ford finally fixed the sticky reverse gear box problem  some will know and understand what I mean  No more forcing the car into reverse or repeatedly pressing the clutch until it goes  In fact  gear box is nice  as is clutch on this car  For a four cylinder  engine performs nicely  Don t expect to race anyone  but you can get it up to 90 without the car shaking to death  don t try this with a 91 escort  Gas mileage is good  Engine is laid out and marked well enough to know what s where  Trunk space is large  but beware the hinges which can crush tall items placed under it Overall  Would be a nice  cheap secondhand car  but leaves much to be desired at new  full price  Has had 2 recalls so far br br
