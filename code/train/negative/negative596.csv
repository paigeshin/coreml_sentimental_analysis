  Apparently the automatic closing sliding door feature is in earlier Windstars as well  but I m sure we would have heard about more injuries if they were made so improperly i b The Windstar 2001 b I went to visit my fiance at work yesterday  He works at a  Ford Dealership b  and often gets to see the features of new vehicles before they are released to the public  The one good feature I saw  is that the  2001 Windstars  come with  TV s and  VCR s   I m not a car person  and I don t know whether the earlier versions have TVs or not  Him and his co worker had a  Sony Playstation  hooked up and were playing games while in the comfort of a heated minivan b i The Downside b i They were sitting in the vehicle  and I was outside The side door was open  My Fiance s foot was hanging out the door  I lifted the handle  This vehicle has an b automatic door shut feature b  The door started to close  and wouldn t stop  I yelled at him to move his foot  Luckily  he did   The door shut and sealed itself quietly i  I couldn t believe this  He assured me there were sensors to stop the door  but when he was trying to show me  he had to wave his hands all over the place  and even still  it hardly ever stopped closing the door   There are only two little motion sensors b b i Let me ask you this i b What types of people usually use minivans like this   Families  Mothers with children b  If a mom were to turn her back  and the door starts to close  a kind near the door could be hurt very badly  Since the closing is virtually sound less  the only sounds would be the kid screaming over a lost finger b Other new features b  There is a low tire pressure warning system that lets you know when your tires are low  3 8 Litre  V6 engine  Power windows  locks  brakes  Child safety door locks b The Ford Company b As well as having a not so great vehicle here and there  the  Ford  company also has its downfalls  They don t honor warranty if you are at or even near the ending term or mileage limit  Their parts cost more than you can get at an independent dealer   FYI  The employees are charge fifteen percent MORE if they want to get something before their pay day i i In general  I don t feel that Ford Windstar 2001 is a very safe vehicle  but that s just my Epinion i b Thumbs down   or off    to Windstar b
