 I own a 98 Windstar that was purchased after we learned that we were expecting our second child  I spent hours reading consumer magazines and researching full size cars and mini vans  I pretty much knew that a mini van would be more up my alley so a larger car never had much of a chance  All that I had read about vans was that the Windstar was what we were looking for but probably out of our price range  Was I ever happy to read an ad in our local paper with a local dealer selling them at under 20 000 00 I must say that out of all the dealerships we went to while looking at various vans from different companies the Ford dealership won hands down as far as good sales people  The salesman listened to what we wanted in a van and made sure that it s what we got  When we didn t qualify for all of the rebates that were being offered he still made sure the selling price was in our range and we got some decent financing terms  After 3 days of debating we went ahead and purchased the Windstar After only having the van for a month or so was when our problems started  First it was a little thing  The windshield had come unsecured to the van and had to be re glued  After an all day stay at the service department we were on the road again  Then after about 3 or 4 months of ownership we had a transmission leak  After another stay  this time overnight  we were reunited  8 months after ownership we had to have a rod replaced  Things went relatively smooth for a while before we were back to the service dept  for mystery transmission problems and more noises coming from under the vehicle This time we needed to have a sensor in the transmission replaced  As for the mystery noises that turned out to be many things  We had another rod replaced  the steering column replaced  a cracked strut casing  and something else that escapes me at the moment Holy cow  I don t drive at breakneck speeds nor to I beat on a vehicle  I have two children in the van most of the time so I can t afford to be reckless  Now my van is acting up again with the transmission and the service dept  can t find a thing wrong with it  After a talk with the man that worked on my van I am no longer confident in Ford products  He explained that the vehicle that was sold to me was originally designed for mail delivery and not highway use  So at highway speeds it is possible that the van just acts up because the transmission can t handle them  Not a comforting thought Also I was told by the service dept  that Windstar s are known for having to have rods replaced Why didn t anyone tell me that before Now I have strange squeals coming form under the hood when I turn my a c on  I am 1000 miles away from going on to my extended warranty plan and I am grateful I bought it  I fear that I would go broke if I had not  Unfortunatly I am stuck with the van until it dies or my husband s car does  But I can tell you I look forward to the day when I can get a new van from another car manufacture br br
