 Thankfully I do not own this car  because if I did I would curse myself everyday for making such a terrible decision much as my boyfriend does  He bought this car nearly two years ago  I told him then not to buy it  and I still tell him now what a terrible deal it really was  I have had the misfortune  perhaps fortune since I will never have to deal with such an experience from this particular car  of being present and experiencing every single one of this cars downfalls since the day he bought it  Sometimes I even have to drive it myself when I am nice enough to let him borrow my wonderful Honda Civic For starters this car looks horrible form the outside  I have never been able to get over where the side view mirrors are placed  it looks absolutely ridiculous  to have them sticking out right in the middle of the front door rather than at the front like most cars  It is also very boxy in shape and is very high off the ground  The inside is not much better  there is hardly any interior room  and as unimportant as it is the controls are tacky and poorly placed This car has cost my boyfriend almost as much as he paid for it in repairs  and there is seriously always something wrong with it  things he can t afford to fix  He has to replace the transmission  the struts are crap and he severely needs new ones  it is so bad that you get a headache from all the bumps and vibrations  There were serious problems with the steering when he first got it that needed to be fixed immediately  it had alternator problems  and the list goes on  there have been so many repairs it s hard to keep track  Many repairs can be expected with a used car but this is ridiculous  However  the biggest problem with the car is not all the maintenance it needed and still needs  although that certainly doesn t help  it is how terribly this car handles  The shifting is terrible and even though this car needs a new transmission we were told that is always will shift poorly  It accelerates slowly and seemingly has no power  Perhaps the only good thing about this car is the fact that it is reasonable on gas  not great   but not horrible either I definitely would not recommend this car  it is known as a lemon among most people  If however  you do decide to purchase an escort I would seriously recommend getting it looked at by a mechanic to assess the cost of repairs before you buy it  So far you re probably thinking I m unreasonable in my assessment  but consider this  the car only had 46000 miles on it when he bought it
