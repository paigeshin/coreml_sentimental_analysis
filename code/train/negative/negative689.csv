 I purchased a 1994 Ford Probe SE in April 1999 with 67 000 miles on the odometer for  5 300  It now has about 87 000 miles  The reviews were very positive  giving it an excellent rating for performance and fun to drive as well as reliability  I don t trust Ford with making quality products but since the Probe is built by Mazda  I was more willing to believe it  After a test drive on the highway it was clear that it lives up to the promise  The steering is responsive and assuring  the 2 0 I 4 paired with an automatic transmission doesn t make the SE a street racer but has enough power for casual commuting  The front seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room to accommodate two tall adults in front  The Probe is also very pleasing to the eye  inside and out  In my opinion  it looks better than any of the vehicles  Integra  Eclipse  etc  it competed with before Ford stopped production in 1997  Visibility is excellent  but the side mirrors are small and should be very carefully adjusted to avoid not seeing a vehicle in the next lane when changing lanes Although the design and performance of Ford Probe is very satisfying  the same doesn t apply to the experience of owning one  I ve had to visit the shop time after time and the maintenance costs are through the roof  For the 20 months I ve owed the car  I had to overhaul the transmission  2400  replace both CV axles  350  and the motor mounts  600  Add to this expensive maintenance  replace brake rotors and disk pads  belts  etc  and I have paid nearly double the purchase price  Not a good selling point Another problem is the paint  My Probe is a light blue metallic but the same stands for all colors  The paint chips and scratches very easily  It also has begun to burn out  despite all waxing and care  I live in Texas  but the quality of the paint is still inexcusable  Another heat related thing  the plastic vent cover under the windshield bent and broke in the middle when it heated up under the sun  Now it expands and arches when I turn on the heat The sound system includes 4 speakers and an amplifier  The speakers are rather mediocre and don t mask the rattles very well  Overall  the biggest problems of Ford Probe come from poor engineering and build quality  Now that I m done with college  I m looking to sell this car in the next couple of months and get a BMW br br
