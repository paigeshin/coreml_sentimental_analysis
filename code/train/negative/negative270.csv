 I looked at all the other SUV s and chose a 1997 Ford Explorer XTL for the roomy and comfortable interior  Until approximately 24 000 miles my only trips to the shop were for oil changes  but problems have steadily come sice then  First came a problem with the accelerator sticking the dealer said that nothing was wrong  but 6 months later  Ford had a recall At 37 500 miles  just after the warranty expired the switch on the automatic seat broke and a week later the metal lever that controls the back of the seat literally broke in two  Next  I noticed a shaking sensation when braking replaced the brakes  but the problem remains  The check engine light came on which caused me to replace multiple sensors  It continued to glow then one day  it began flashing then went off  Also  the CD changer  installed in the console  only works sporadically  When I took it to the dealer while the warranty was still in  they stated there was nothing wrong  A clicking sound on the right side started somewhere around 38 000 miles  Later I noticed that my engine wasn t running smoothly  my Explorer was hard to crank  and it frequently chokes down  I have taken it to several mechanics to attempt repairs  but all of them have concluded that there is a crack in the intake manifold  a major repair that has to be done by the dealer  It has become unreliable  and I have been advised by 3 repairmen to trade it soon br br
