 I have a 1992 Ford Tempo  and I wish I didn t  This car is the definition of the word lemon  Everything that can go wrong with a car has gone wrong with this one  I have replaced two starters  the alternator  and all of the hoses  The electrical system has had to be rewired  The power windows only work on rare occaision  The power locks have never worked  The power steering has gone out  twice  The brakes are mushy  The gas mileage is frighteningly low  The service engine light went on the second week I had it  and no matter what I have repaired it never goes off You want more reasons to avoid this car  The jack that comes with it is useless  The windshield wipers stick  The turn signals have a habit of sticking  and not deactivating after you complete the turn  The odometer doesn t work  It leaks oil  It leaks transmission fluid  It makes funny noises  It dies constantly Is there anything good about this car  I like the color  It s a nice bright red In conclusion  I hate this car  The Ford Tempo should be avoided at all cost br br
