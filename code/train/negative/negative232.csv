 We purchased this van to provide adequate space for our family during travel  Boy did we get more than we expected  This Van has not only provided us with the space we needed but we also have so many options and luxuries  Beginning with the outside of the van  We bought a 95 model the paint is in immaculate condition  Looks brand new   two tone paint green and tan Love the combination Engine  Clean  runs great  sounds and drives like brand new van  Not bad for 5 years old  Looks like this one may be worth the money Interior  Excellent  Spacious  Comfy seating with adequate leg room  Not cramped  Many options inside   ie  lumbar in front seats  adjustable seat belt height  heated outside mirrors  and lots of extra storage room  The inside is my favorite part  I just cannot believe how nice this van is My overall opinion is  spend the money and purchase this van  It is well worth every cent  I love mine and when the time comes to retire it I will surly purchase another Ford Windstar br br
