 I requested Budget Rent a Car for a Toyota Tercel during my 5 days in Illinois and Indiana recently  but instead  ended up with a green  2000 Ford Escort 4 door with 4000 miles on the odometer  I was somewhat excited because this was like test driving a brand new car  a feat I don t perform very often  Furthermore  the test drive was going to last the whole weekend b Basic Features  Except for the automatic transmission and air conditioning  the Escort I drove was barebones  That means roll up window  manual door locks  and levers and knobs to adjust the seats  no electrical assistance  The car came with an AM FM radio with cassette  which helped during my daily 3 4 hours drive from Monticello to Indianapolis and back  I had to pull the antenna out manually  keeping with the barebones spirit of the car b Interior  It took a while to get used to the seats  as I had to make several adjustments to make myself somewhat comfortable  The seats can move back  amp  forth by the lever under the front of it  and the upper portion can tilt forward and back with a rotating knob on the left  a standard way to adjust seats on most cars  I felt that the seat bottom could have used more cushion  as it is not tiltable and I didn t get enough support on my thighs  leading my hips to hurt the first 2 days of driving   I cured this by taking my shoes off while driving which lowered my legs  There was no remote adjust on either outside mirrors  which was just a minor inconvenience since I only had to adjust them once  The gauges on the car were very Spartan  with 120 mph speedometer odometer  fuel gauge  temperature gauge  and warning lights  but no tachometer or oil pressure gauge  One nice feature was remote trunk opener  a yellow button underneath the steering wheel b Engine Transmission  The Escort s Overhead Cam  OHC  2 0 liter engine had a lot of spunk  as I was able to drive 70 85 mph without stressing the engine  I didn t floor the accelerator much during the entire 5 days  The engine noise  however  was somewhat annoying  sort of a choked buzzing noise that is common with both GM  amp  Ford s 4 cylinder cars  If I wanted this much noise  then I d want the engine to sound throaty  not choked  Most 4 cylinder engines in Japanese or European cars feel smoother and quieter than the Escort  Furthermore  my 3 cylinder 1985 Chevy Sprint  with 110 000  miles  seems smoother and quieter The 4 speed automatic transmission  with OverDrive  was actually pretty good  with solid shifting and timely downshifting when I passed other cars  A Toyota smooth transmission would not fit well with this car  as it would contrast too much with the buzzy engine  In a way  I was happy with this  quot quasi sportiness quot  as I always knew which gear the car was in just by listening to the engine and keeping track of the distinct shifts b Driving  The steering on the Escort was actually very good  as it had good feedback and pointed the car where I steered  even though it s power steering   it felt more to me like it was  quot power assisted quot  I was greeted with thunderstorms every morning  but the Escort felt just as solid in the rain and I felt very comfortable driving it 65 70 mph The gas mileage of the Escort was actually very good  at about 36 mpg  9 4 gallons per 340 miles  This included a little stop  amp  go driving to fight traffic around Indianapolis Speedway b Overall Impression  The Ford Escort seems like a pretty good value for the money  with usable horsepower  solid handling  and great gas mileage  The car s styling is somewhat generic  and there are enough minor annoyances like difficult to adjust seats and engine noise to remind you that this is a  quot starter quot  car suited for students and budget buyers  With the Ford Focus and Toyota Echo in the marketplace now  it d be tough for me to recommend the Escort as a new car purchase  However  time will tell if the Escort will become a reliable used car  in which case I would highly recommended it for use as an inexpensive commute car like the Chevrolet Sprint I drive
