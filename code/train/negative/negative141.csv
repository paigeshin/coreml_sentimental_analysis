 I have been the unfortunate victim of Ford ownership  I know I have no one to blame but myself but the fact remains I have not one   but two Ford vehicles that I wish I never laid eyes on   One of these products is a 200 Ford Ranger which was purchased in September of 2000  The Ranger is a small truck 4 cylinder to boot   so my expections in the power department was pre decided  I bought the truck to skiddle around town in   and haul a this and that from Home Depot so power is not something I expected although the very lack of power is something I never expected  I am lucky to hit 35 after 5 minutes and the transmission does lag more than quite a bit It whines and cries upon any boot to the gas pedal and never gets up to speed Dont even attempt a freeway or an upward grade   I believe you may roll backwards  The gas milage is worse than bad and the promised 22 27 is far from being true  in fact it is more like 16 19 if your lucky  With gas at 2 00 a gallon I consider this a killjoy on the pocketbook  But the worse part of this Ranger is the lack of response from Ford or our dealership to do anything about the lack of power   not to mention the cosmetic problems   On wednesday of this week it wil be my seventh trip into the dealership to secure my inside roof  Yes   you got it the interior roof is collapsing and no one wants to do a thing about it  And living in a desert area I cant seem to keep the plastic molding from warpage no matter how ard I try  But Ford and their bumper to bumper warranty doesnt mean a hill of beans if they refuse to act and honor that warranty as they did in my case  Basically if there isnt a technician report sent out   then there isnt a problem  So since my transmission or interior doesnt have a tech report released by those wonderful engineers at Ford well I have to live with it and all the other rattles and hums this vehicle has  and in the mean time I feel stupider than stupid for giving Ford anything but a good cussing  So avoid Ford porducts unless you want to live the horrors of Ford ownership like I have for the past year and a half
