 I bought this 1994 Tempo in June of 1995 for vehicle for business purposes  It s the worst vehicle I have every owned   and it s not even fixable  To date no one has been able to diagnose what is wrong with this lemon  I m scared to go anywhere with it  You have to carry a cell phone when you do drive it for when you break down  I drive about 25 km to work and on a hot day  I may not make it to work and won t make it home  During the hot weather  it breaks down about three times a week on my way home  and usually the breakdown point is within the same 2 km area I bought extended warranty which to date has covered very few of the repairs  In fact  they just can t find what is wrong with the car  It quits when it gets hot  just like an old fashioned vapour lock used to   sometimes will restart within ten minutes but sometimes takes a couple of hours  it quits or won t start when the weather is wet  not even right after a tune up  it quits when you go through a puddle and splash water on the lower part of the engine it may or may not start if the weather is cold  and the service engine light hardly ever goes off  The codes are of absolutely no assistance to diagnosing the problems  Last summer it was in for service several times a month  usually on a tow truck  and it is still not fixed The gas mileage is just about the same as my old beater 1988 F150 Supercab 3 4 ton truck  In fact  the last trip from Halifax to Toronto was cheaper driving the truck than the trip 2 months before driving the 1994 Tempo  And the truck made it no problems  the car broke down Christmas Eve in Montreal and then again in Toronto on Boxing Day I buy a vehicle expecting to get at least ten years out of it  My husband has a lot of mechanics tickets for heavy equipment and maintains our vehicles very well  As soon as I finish paying off this lemon this summer  it s going  I still have a year s warranty left on it but I just can t afford the gas  the downtime and repairs that aren t covered Nothing the Ford dealer represented to me on this vehicle is true br br
