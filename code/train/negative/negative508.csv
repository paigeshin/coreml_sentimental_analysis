 I bought a 1995 Probe in 1998  with its sweet lines and smooth ride  a black beauty with the spoiler  the kind of car all your friends get jealous over  But when it was less than a month after I bought it  that it went into the shop to stay from March UNTIL September  my friends were less than jealous  Going from one mechanic to another  with Ford people running tests on it  After rebuilding the transmission for about  1800  I got it back in September or so  I got to drive it until the end of February  and back to the shop again  Both times the O D light had come on flashing  and over 60 MPH  the car would jerk forward  but the transaxle  as the manual suggests  was not the problem  Once again the transmission was worked on from February March UNTIL almost June  When I went to pick it up  I got about 10 miles away from the shop  and it was running hot back to the shop for the Water pump to get fixed  THEN  after 2 months  I once again went to pick it up again  and the engine was revving on its own  So now it sits at the Ford dealership automotive department  with a new they discovered after replacing the timing belt  that that was not the cause of the trouble 525 timing belt  with a suggestion that it might be the throttle body  for another  825 or so  If anyone has web links to other troubled probes HELP br br
