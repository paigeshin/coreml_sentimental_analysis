 I used to have this car  Note the  used to  part  It was sold for a much nicer Honda Accord  The first thing you notice while test driving the  97 Explorer is how bumpy the ride is  The shocks are a little too hard  even for an SUV  Going over speedbumps at 5mph feels like driving over a boulder in any other car After about 3 days of normal driving  you ll have to fill up the gas tank  And probably by that time you ll need an oxygen mask while you drive  The pollution from this thing is tremendous  typical of any wonderful Ford  It s barely within our State s legal limits  even brand new  The gas mileage is advertised to be between 15 16 for a V8  but it doesn t achieve even that  I found that under normal driving conditions  I could get maybe 12 miles to a gallon  if I was lucky  Normally I got 10 or 11 on the average  Pretty terrible  yes The suspension on this Explorer was horrendous  Every time you brake  the suspension creaks and groans under the stress  I tried to have it fixed while under warranty  but nothing could be done  Even replacing the entire suspension system did no help  Plus  the driver s side seatbel
