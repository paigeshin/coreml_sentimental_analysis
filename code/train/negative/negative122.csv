Neg
 The most negative of my rental experiences I have saved for last  The 1999 Ford Contour  If this car had the options like a larger engine than the 4Cyl  a better sound system  better seats  something  then this might only be a mediocre rating  But there were none  It allowed for an entire 10 days of disappointing driving   Outside b Visually unremarkable  the Contour has the plain lines of a scaled down Taurus  The base model has nothing to make it look appealing  it still has Ford s unfortunate taste for ovals dominating it s appearance  Fit and finish is fine  it had a smallish trunk that seemed full with two medium bags and a laptop case  The doors are somewhat small  making entry and exit more challenging  The doors are also thinner  and feel flimsy compared to other cars that I have been driving   Inside  The seats were small and uncomfortable  The driver s seat reminded me of the long flight that I had just been through  It was a long trip and being unable to get settled simply made it worse  The panel display is flanked by a plastic divider that emphasizes how small the car is  It really worsens the cramped feeling in the passenger cabin  Engine noise is loud  with the 4cyl engine whining at almost every acceleration  It often overpowered the radio which was also whiny when played loud  I could quickly see that this car was not going to make the 1 5 hour journey pleasant  It does have the normal package of power windows  and locks  and they are easy to understand and use  The other controls are as easy to understand  but everything in the car has a cheap feel to it  I was consistently nervous that I was going to break something  But generally I was thinking of the engine   Driving  This is not a drivers car  At least not with  this  engine  As I dodged the 18 wheel heavies on the highway out of Cincinatti  I wasn t at all confident about the acceleration or the handling of the little Ford  Trying to pass a heavy dump truck on a two lane onramp I had the pedal to floor wishing for just some of the horsepower I had left garaged in Massachusetts  It was pretty much that way for the rest of the trip  Slow pickup  and that only to the tune of the engine whining loudly  Iffy handling in turns  I felt the car was at maximum performance at 75   All around  I won t drive this car again  I began specifically requesting full size cars after this unless I could get a Grand Am or a Mustang at close to the same rate  This car is fine for basic transportation or short trips  but I found it small  underpowered  and uncomfortable
