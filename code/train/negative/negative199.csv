 First of all I have to say that the Ford Contour is a very comfortable vehicle and is a great family car  My fiancee and I own a Ford Contour currently and it gets us where we need to go  It is a pretty dependable car  The engine runs great and we have not had any under the hood work in a year  The problem however is the axles and the tires  The axles are weak and if not aligned just right the tires where extremely fast  I would have to recommend the car for familys but not for single young people with higher chances of accidents etc  Once alignment is gone or anything happens then the cash starts pouring out of the pockets  Something else is that the car looses value quickly  Not a good investment if planning on selling it  I do believe that the car would run forever if taken care of but once the miles get on it then be prepared to loose some money  Believe me  I know  Well  the sum it all up it is very roomy  great engine  and great gas mileage  But on the contrary it depreciates quickly and often requires alot of body work  But we all have our own opinions don t we br br
