  A fter the Ranger was transformed from a large midsized truck in the 60s and 70s to a relatively small truck in the early 80s  it s been on one of the best selling trucks in its class  Good price  good looks  and a wide array of engines have contributed to the current Ranger s success   Engine b  For 2002  there is not too much new in the drivetrain department  The base engine is a 135 horsepower DOHC 4 cylinder available in the XL models  The next engine up is a 150 HP powered 3 0 OHV V6 engine   the one in my test truck  The 3 0 is available in the XLT  XLT 4 wheel drive  the  Edge  4  wheel drive  The top of the list is a 4 0 liter engine which produces an impressive 207 horsepower  This is just an optional engine that will set you back around 800 extra dollars  All engines are either matched with a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic  The test truck was an XLT 4x4  3 0 liter  automatic  Dressed in black clear coat metallic  with tan cloth interior i Driving Impressions i   Entering the vehicle  was easy enough  test truck had a lift kit  and very large meaty tires  but there was no problem getting my fanny into the seat  When the key was turned  the OHV 3 0 liter engine came to life without hesitation  At low Speeds the 3 0 has enough torque  185lb ft  for quick low speed  acceleration   but entering the freeway   and trying to get up to 70 mph is a whole different story  This truck equipped with the OHV 3 0 and a 4  speed automatic begs to be driven slow  Hills are this truck s worst enemy  With cruise control set   70 MPH  this Ranger would down shift into 3rd with even the slightest incline  Engine noise was louder than expected  and at 70 MPH this truck cruised at a little over 3 000 RPM   Handling  is good enough  not sports car material of course  but I was surprised that I could keep up with small cars while driving through the  Avenue of the Giants  The XLT 4x4 3 0 can tow up to 3 800lbs I have taken other years of the Ford Ranger off road and it does fairly well  not as well as the Toyota Tacoma which seems to have a better 4x4 system  however is adequate accomplishing off road tasks i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  is not Lexus material  but then again this isn t a Lexus nor is is made to be even close  The interior of the XLT 4 wheel drive came with excellent ergonomics  driver and passenger airbags  60 40 split bench  a tachometer  very supportive  and comfortable seats  There is plenty of room in the front and rear for small adults  There was a very clear sounding Ford produced stereo system  Power everything  a factory installed alarm  and many other options that can be had depending oh how large your wallet is   Ford com  has all the info you could need on optional and standard equipment i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks pretty much like it has since 1997  There is a new grille for the 2002 model year  The Ranger seems to get a different styled grille every other year or so to keep the style fresh  The 2002 XLT Ford Ranger truck is very masculine and handsome despite its small package  There is a XLT FX 4 package available that will give this truck a more rugged appearance  huge tires  and Bliston shocks are also added  The  price  for an XLT 4x4 is around  20 000 fairly loaded  With every amenity available  The XLT can run for nearly  23 000  The 3 0 OHV is a proven engine  it has been in cars and trucks since 1986  so reliability is probably good  but I can t comment personally on this particular model year   WWW  CONSUMER REPORTS ORG  has more info i Conclusion i The 2002 Ford Ranger represents an excellent value  however the more competent competition offered from Toyota makes this truck less desirable  If you are in the market for a work truck  I d go with a Tacoma or a full sized Ford F 150 which offer an even more impressive package Looking for a slightly larger truck  You may want to check out    a href content 53380157060  my review on the 2002 Ford F 150 a    Happy Car Shopping
