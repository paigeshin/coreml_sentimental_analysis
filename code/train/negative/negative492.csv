 My wife bought this car in 2001 and at first  within the first 5000 miles  the car seemed like a decent choice for a small sedan  But in the last year or so  we have regretted the day we signed the loan papers on this close to being a lemon  Here s why  Please note the Focus in question has 32 200 miles on it currently 1  Loud  weak Engine  even when this car is driven at speeds less than 30 mph  there is a pronounced loud drone of the engine  At freeway speeds  gt 55 mph  the engine noise is as loud as a delivery truck  Yes  this is a 4 cylinder vehicle that struggles to accelerate rapidly and labors to do anything  But the problem is not simply due to being 4 cylinders  In comparison to our other car a 2000 Honda Civic  4 cylinders  the Civic appears to be a V6 and the engine noise is not 1 4 as loud 2  Bizarre problems  including a trunk door that takes TWO slams of the lid to close down from THREE after a trip to the Ford mechanic  A gas gauge that never shows FULL even when the tank is full leaving the pump  This was due to bad gauge sensor anther trip to the Ford mechanic  In addition the fuel pump on this car went out at 26 000 miles  Trip number 3 to the Ford mechanic  The brakes and engine belts squeak horribly whenever the outside humidity goes much above 50  The belt squeaking is especially embarassing  I ve had people at stopped traffic signals ask me to roll my window down to say   Excuse me  but is there something wrong with your car sir 3  Poor fabric in seats where everything  Lint  hair  etc  sticks to like a magnet  We ve tried the most powerful industrial strength vacuums out there with no luck 4  Rapid depreciation  the bottom line is if you buy a Focus expect to keep it awhile as it depreciates at a rate much faster than your average car  We owe in excess of  10k on the loan  according to Edmunds com the car is worth about  6400 for a trade in 8200 if sold privately a loss either way we might choose to sell it 5  Driving comfort  the ride for this car is stiff and the front drivers and passengers seats are cramped  At higher speeds  gt 55 mph  the car shutters and every road bump is felt  Long trips are an exhausting experience Needless to say  this is the last Ford  my wife and I plan to buy  A Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla are much better uses of your car buying dollar  In addition  there have been numerous recalls on this lemon  I feel like I should make a standing appointment with the Ford mechanic
