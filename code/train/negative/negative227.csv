 I HAVE EDITED THIS DUE TO A VERY MAJOR EXPENSE  ENGINE FAILURE  ON JANUARY 29  2000  PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM FOR NEW AND VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION From the time we picked up our 1995 Windstar  we loved the ride  But  as many new vehicles are prone to  this one was in the shop for tweaking a few times This was probably an omen of things to come  as we have had the brakes replaced at low mileage  and under warranty  because Ford claimed that they did not have the proper brakes to install in the first place when the vehicle was new  I still don t understand that one Also  the  quot Check Engine Light quot  is constantly on  We have had it checked out several times when the vehicle was under warranty and they have not been able to find any cause for it  nor could they fix it After the warranty expired  we needed to have the Windstar serviced again because of an antifreeze leak  this turned out to be a recall notice item  but still cost us plenty  The nearly  1 000 in repair bills was due to the structure of the engine which needed to be somewhat dismantled so that the mechanics could work on the problem  labor costs  Oh  they said that we could take the chance and not get the repair work done since it was so costly  but knowing that we could have major problems if we didn t fix it  what else could we do but shell out the money to Ford MY HUSBAND TOOK THE WINDSTAR IN BECAUSE OF STRANGE SOUNDS IN THE ENGINE AREA  2 WEEKS AGO  AND WAS TOLD THAT  AT 79 000 MILES  THE ENGINE NEEDED REPLACING  THIS WILL COST US  3 000  DOLLARS  THE EXTENDED 3 YEAR WARRANTY ON THIS WORK WILL COST ANOTHER  1 634 00  WHEN THE DEALER WAS CALLED YESTERDAY TO CHECK ON THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK ON THE REBUILT ENGINE  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE LIFTERS ARE BAD  TOO  THIS WILL ADD ANOTHER  200 00 TO THE COST  You bet Ford will get a letter on this one AND THEN SOME I thank goodness for the communication possibilities of the internet because I did a search on  quot Ford Windstar Recall Notice quot  and was alarmed to find that thousands of people who have purchased the 1995 Ford Windstar are having similarly costly expenses and all seem to be pretty much the same in the nature of the repair work  Although it is comforting   to know that we are among a large group of people having the same wallet draining experience  I believe that it is time for the rest of the  quot silent majority quot  to speak up  If enough of us get to the point of saying  quot I m not going to put up with the way we re treated by the Ford Motor Company quot  we should be able to force Ford to put out a recall on the engine so that they must pay for the trash we are stuck with One last note before I end this ranting  through my research of dissatisfied customers on the internet  I learned that the recall notice on the head gasket problem was apparently not received by everyone  If you have not received this important notice  be sure to contact Ford  for whatever good that will do br br
