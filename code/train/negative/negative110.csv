 I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic  interior  power  warranty  options  etc  points of view  I believe an important  but always neglected area  though is from an undercar point of view  and let me tell you  most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear  There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there  but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion  and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision  If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles  I hope to help you decide based on my experience  which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of  and reliability of  one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole  the steering and suspension system  The Ford Contour  unfortunately  from an undercar standpoint falls into the category of a weak and suspect suspension  I just read a great review by mkaresh on the Ford Contour from almost every other viewpoint but the undercar  but he is an intellectual professional and I am a mechanical professional and I m quite sure he doesn t spend a lot of time on a dirty shop floor  In times past I could look at my schedule at work and accurately predict by what vehicles were on it where I would be able to take a break because I would be sure I would just be writing an estimate and not doing an alignment on that one  Unfortunately the Contour is starting to come into this category  To start off with one of the things about the Contour that I don t like is that the ball joints and outer tie rods both are susceptible to premature wear out  Neither are factory greasable  but to be fair  hardly any cars anymore allow for chassis lube  In as little as 60 000 miles I have seen Contours needing both lower ball joints and outer tie rod ends replaced due to loosness  It is not an extremely expensive repair  but one would hope not to have to get that news at such a low mileage point  I am sure if you are the original owner things should be covered under warranty  but how many times has the dealer been very co operative with you and taken care of a warranty claim without any trouble   But if you are the second owner   Another bothersome problem cropping up with the Contour lately is the rear coil springs break  They seem very small in diameter compared to other cars in this class and are in fact weak  Usually in replacing coil springs on most vehicles you need a spring compressor to remove and replace springs due to the extreme pressure  but I changed rear springs on a Contour not too long ago and was able to push the spring down and start the nut on the strut shaft with just hand pressure  These were Ford motor company factory replacement springs  and hopefully an aftermarket spring will be stronger  The Contour is only toe adjustable  not allowing for any caster adjustment nor front or rear camber adjustment  so if you give it a little curb shot and it gets knocked out of align  there just is no taking it to your tech and tweaking it back into align  It is out and will stay out  except for the toe angle  If you are considering a new Contour read more reviews and weigh them out against this one to see if you can justify the purchase  if you are considering a used one  have it checked carefully by YOUR mechanic for the things mentioned above  Hopefully this will help you in making an informed decision  I for one would never own a Contour  but I am basing this on just my experience from underneath  you make the call
