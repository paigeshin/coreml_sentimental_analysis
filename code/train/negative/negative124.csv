 I should start out by letting you know that I do not know much about cars  But after leasing this vehicle from Ford  I am ready to go back to the horse and buggy  The car has been in the shop more than it has been in my garage  We have leased it for 2 years and it has already had 2 recalls  It is extremely limited in space and anyone with small children will regret the day they purchase this lemon Ford has discontinued the model for the 2001 sales year and for good reasons  Although you cannot purchase this vehicle brand new  I would also discourage someone from buying it secondhand  To top it off  the service department at the Ford is horrendous  They lack professionalism  product knowledge and simple manners  I have to spend a lot time at the garage because of this horrible car and I am not sure if I will purchase another Ford again  The ride in the contour is rough and loud  On a major expressway it feels like you are riding on Space Mountain  The air conditioner is weak at best and the trunk can barely fit a stroller  I guess I should commend Ford for discontinuing this model br br
