 I have owned to Ford Escort s in my life  I bought these because they were older models and very cheap  I soon found out why they were so cheap  I used my first Escort  an 85 model  to commute over 60 miles to work  I found it to be very easy to drive and extremely comfortable  The problem was  that the clutch disk wore out on it  Being a front wheel drive vehicle the repairs cost over  600 on a  30 part  Most people prefer not to drive a standard anyway  so this won t matter to you  My biggest piece of advice for this car is DON T BUY A STANDARD  The repairs are extremely difficult for the home mechanic and extremely high in a shop  Secondly  I have found that the smaller 1 6 liter engine is far more fuel effecient and reliable than it s 1 9 liter counterpart  The difference in power between these two engines is practically unnoticeable  All in all a decent car  just make sure you don t pay too much br br
