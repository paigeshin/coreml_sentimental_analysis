 I purchased a 1995 Ford Windstar in 1998 with 45 000 miles already on it  From the first day we experienced problems that were minor and later had major problems  Some problems were never fixed and were hard to trace  The car always  intermittent  indicated that one door was ajar  Usually this happened going around corners and over bumps  We took the van back twice for service but the problem was never fixed  We only gave up on fixing this problem after several major problems overshadowed the minor one  The first major problem was the battery went dead  which by itself is not major  however we tried to jump start the car which ended up burning out the on board computer  Battery cost plus tow was 100  The second time the battery went dead was within the next two days  Again a tow was in order and a bill for  300 for the onboard computer  Next the car overheated  and was localized to the water pump  Again not a significant problem by itself but later the van continued to overheat  Cost for the water pump  I don t remember but we eventually replaced the heads on the engine for  900  The overheating apparently caused the  quot service engine quot  light to appear  When diagnosed we discovered that the oxygen sensor was now faulty  Estimated cost to repair about  300  Now the O D  overdrive  light on the van began to blink and the transmission started to slip  I was told directly related to the overheating  A repaired transmission was quoted at between  1200 1500 we didn t even ask how much for the O D blinking light to be fixed The van had 110K miles on it in the end  We performed minor repairs on the Transmission that cost  150 but the transmission still slipped but only when placed in reverse  We eventually got too frustrated with the van failing and using tow trucks and finally traded it in on a Toyota RAV 4  Brand new  I ll tell you about the RAV 4 in another review br br
