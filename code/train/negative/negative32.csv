 I bought a 1995 F 150 in late 1994  I also sold it in early 1995  Here are the reasons why I drove the truck off the lot in November of 1994  I liked the way the F 150 looked  I thought it looked pretty tough  I also heard a few good things about them from my friends  I didn t exactly baby this truck  but I didn t drive it too hard  I maintained it well  I never beat it to the point where it might break  One day  as I knew inside it would it broke  only 2 months after I got it  I was driving through the snow  about a foot or so of it  and I put the truck in four wheel drive  I noticed right away that something was wrong  It was pulling hard to the left and was very hard to steer  I brought it right back to the Ford dealer and they said I needed new hubs  That was the first thing that broke  In addition to that  the speedometer broke  most of the levers inside  including my seat levers  window roll down levers  and many others  began to just crack like twigs  I then realized this truck was made with very little craftsmanship  like any other Ford I ever owned The F 150 also lacked the power I wanted in a full size pick up  It didn t get up and go like my old Chevys used to  Being very disappointed with this truck I sold it right after winter and bought myself a 1995 Chevy pick up  I was much more satisfied with that then I ever was with my Ford br br
