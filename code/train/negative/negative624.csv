 I bought this vehicle when my last car died I probably should have spent more time researching the car and the dealership but I needed a car  My last car was a used one so I figured that this time I would go ahead and spend the extra money and buy a new one  Worst mistake of my life  I had picked the car up with only 3 miles on it from the dealership  miles from my test drive It was in the shop within a week from when I purchased the vehicle  It was a 5 speed standard I had just thought that it was just a problem with the gears grinding but it turned out to be serious There were problems with the clutch  the transmission the brakes  the radio and the cassette player The dealership that I bought the car from was 45 minutes away so I brought it to the one that was in my city They charged me for looking at my car everything was still under warranty Money that I never saw back I was accused by the other dealership of not knowing how to drive a standard and intentually damaging my new vehicle  NO one goes out and buys a brand new standard and not know how to drive one  Needless to say I was considerably unhappy So I contacted the FORD company itself and they weren t any help either they wouldnt replace the car or offer me a discount or even an apology what I got was we have to try to fix the problem first To this day the car still isnt right Last week my heater went out do to a hose coming undone second time its been fixed Something else I found annoying  the bumper is plastic  Back to my other gripes about the car I was way overcharged  I was charged for things that I found out after were supposed to be standard on my car I was charged  25 for a cigarette lighter and ashtray  I don t smoke I was charged extra for the cassette player I was charged extra for the non keyless entry And on top of being charged extra I was told that I had to go through a particular finance company  a whole new problem and since I didn t have a co signer i was charged a few thousand dollars extra My credit report shows a co singer So not only did I not get a good car for a good deal I cant even trade this one in until its payed off and worthless not that it really isn t right now I cant rate this car low enough I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy br br
