 The early  90s were good for Ford  Sales were strong  recalls were few  Firestone tires were the norm and there was nothing wrong with that  By 1992 the Taurus had overtaken the Honda Accord as the best selling car in America  In fact it held on to the position until 1997 when the Toyota Camry won the sales race  So what was it about the Taurus that made it sell so well  Was it the looks  the performance  the quality  the price  I had only one encounter of an older Taurus before last week  a beat up 1989 model that a friend of mine used to own  Last week I got to drive a 1993 Taurus GL with only 71 000 miles  How would it compare to the last older Taurus I drove Powertrain  C  This Taurus like so may others had the venerable 3 0 liter pushrod  Vulcan  V6  It was good for about 140 horsepower  Keep in mind that the Taurus was amongst the bigger midsizers of its time so it was not surprising that this 3 0 liter was not quite up to the job  This engine makes quite a lot of noise for not much grunt and it knocked pretty bad  The performance is not helped by a transmission that shifts too soon for my tastes  The shift quality is poor  either it clunks or it slips just a bit  Taurus transmissions are legendary for failure and malfunction  Being that this example only had 72 000 miles made all the less encouraging   Update  As of August 2002 this Taurus blew its tranny with only 76 000 miles  It was soon junked  Sorry it took my almost a year to inform you all of this Handling Steering braking  D So many family sedans of this era had started to become more engaging to drive  The Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord were the sportiest  the Toyota Camry was the smoothest  the Mazda 626 and Nissan Altima being somewhere in between  But Ford tuned the Taurus to appeal to those who consider a car to be just an appliance  The Taurus has perfectly safe handling but the driving experience is numb and devoid of any sense of fun  The steering lacks any sort of feel  It heft is completely artificial  The response is imprecise  The suspension is tuned for a smooth ride but its softness contributes to more body roll than is comfortable  The brakes are horrid  The pedal feels spongy and I had to apply way more pressure than normally do  Overall  this car does not inspire any confidence Interior  D The Taurus was one of the bigger cars in its class  I really expected to be impressed by the interior room  But when I got behind the wheel of the Taurus  I discovered that I have it made in my  93 Mazda 626  My Mazda was one of the smallest cars in the class back then however it has a lot more front legroom than the Taurus  In this car  the wheel arches intrude exactly where I like to keep my left foot whereas my Mazda has plenty of foot room  The Ford s seats provide very little support and are not comfortable even on short trips  This GL model has a power driver s seat but surprisingly has no controls for the all important thigh support  The controls are fairly well laid out and the cupholder design is great IT HOLDS CUPS  Too bad it blocks the low mounted stereo  which has really small buttons  The overall quality of materials is quite bad  The plastic used on the dash and door panels just screams low buck  The fabrics used are not much better  The back seat is pretty roomy but like the fronts  they offer very little comfort and support  And for you skiers out there  the seat does not fold down  Thankfully the trunk is big albeit with a high liftover Exterior  B  As far as looks go the older Taurus was not bad  In late 1985 when the original Taurus made its debut it was cutting edge  The 1992 restyle made it look even better and more upscale  Even today it looks somewhat modern if pretty generic  It s a tried and true styling effort that certainly won t offend anybody  The same could not be said for the 1996 1999 fish face model  which offended many Overall  D It s sad to say that the older Taurus was simply not a very good car  I would like to have thought that given the low mileage it would have driven better  But in reality this babied 1993 model drove pretty much the way my friend s old beat up 1989 model  Just as an example  my 1993 Mazda 626 with 161 000 miles on has not led a charmed life  It was in a major accident once  Yet my  old bruiser  drives way better than the Taurus  It is better built  better engineered and a whole lot more comfortable  Plus its fun and has better resale value  The Honda Accord  Nissan Maxima and Toyota Camry are even better  So I d say skip the Taurus  You ll be glad you did
