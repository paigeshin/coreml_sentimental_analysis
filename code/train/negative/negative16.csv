 Now I m no granola munchin  hippie but this beast of a car is a hazard to the environment and everyone else on the road  While it may be roomy  can easily fit 9 people  this means that the SUV must weigh 9 tons  The vehicle is over 7 feet tall and wider than most parking spaces  All of this excess means one thing  if you are involved in a accident with one of these you will probably be killed   It s like going up against a monster truck  Don t let Ford fool you either  these cars  SUV s in general  do not have any emissions standards so basically these things pollute as much a big rig  With the surge in the popularity of these things that means that the earth is becoming polluted at an even more alarming rate  So maybe the environment or the hazards to everyone else don t phase you  You have your mind set on one of these babies  Just check out the price and the gas mileage these things get  If you live in CT like me then the price of gas alone equals the price of the car in a few years if you drive at least 40 miles a day  All of these things means that this excess room is just costing everyone else including the owner  If it s room you want then get an RV or a van  Just not a stupid  ugly SUV br br
