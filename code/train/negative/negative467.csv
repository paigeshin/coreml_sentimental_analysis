 We bought our 1996 Ford Windstar minivan used in May of 1998 with about 25 000 miles on it  We immediately noticed little things that were annoyances but felt like we could live with it  cup holders which immediately broke  rear motor on vent window no longer working  chair arms breaking  The ride and glide of this van was great  even though the gas mileage was not at all what we had hoped for  I wanted this van because I wanted to keep my children safe  It replaced a 1991 Ford Taurus station wagon which had had numerous problems  all of which we attributed to Ford just having a bad year  All was well until right at 60 000 miles the head gasket blew  Because we were not under warranty  we took it to a local reputable repair shop and paid  1 000 for the repair  In less than two weeks I am driving down a very busy highway and my engine self destructs  Now we have to have a whole new engine  the  1 000 for the head gasket repair is down the tubes  and we have to shell out 20  of the cost for the  new  engine which is  in fact  a remanufactured engine  And on top of that  they have NO idea how long it will take to get it in because there is such a high demand for these engines right now because there are so many people having the same problem as I have had  I am thankful that Ford is only going to charge us 20  of the cost  and I am thankful that they are giving us a 100 000 mile powertrain warranty which will be backdated to the time that we actually bought the van  However  after this has happened and we have read countless reviews of this happening to others  not to mention the transmission troubles and timing gasket troubles we apparently have to look forward to  I go back to my original intent in buying this van  to keep my children safe  This is not the van that I thought I was buying Never again  Ford  Never again Updated information  Yes  within two weeks of getting the van back with the  new  engine  the transmission falls out  That sucker is GONE  We now own a 1998 Toyota Sienna and are very thankful for it  NEVER AGAIN  FORD  No wonder y all are having such troubles
