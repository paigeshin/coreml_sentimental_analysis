 This was my third car and my second Mustang  My first Mustang was the 1964 5 I bought from my neighbor on my 16th birthday  I loved that car  It was a shame the drunken redneck ran over it with his pickup truck  My next car was a 1989 Corolla  completely serviceable  never had a problem  but very boring When I decided I wanted something new  my first thought was an SUV  I was looking at cars when they drove in a truck full of Mustangs  I hadn t really seen the new body style at that time and wasn t thinking Mustang because of the boxier ones of the mid and late 80 s  But this car was beautiful  It was the first Ford that said   I m a Mustang  since the early 70 s  I probably bought the car because of my first Mustang  It was nostalgia as much as anything else  Second reason was that I wanted a sports car again  I could feel myself aging at the time  I was all of 22 and about to graduate from college  and I wanted a fun car again before I settled down  Third reason  it was a V8 at V6 prices What do I love about my Mustang  I live in one of the busiest driving cities in America  The average speed on Atlanta highways is about 80 MPH  In the left lane  you have to do almost 100 to stay alive  My Mustang can do that  Plus  I can dodge the out of staters and foreigners who don t know how to drive in Atlanta and are freaking out in the left lane while driving 55  Third  and probably the best thing  I can hit the gas on that V8 and leave everyone in the dust  well almost everyone  What is not good about this car  space  There isn t any  If you have to carry much more than yourself  you re in trouble  Another thing is the jealous idiots  I have actually caught someone urinating on my car  His friend was keying it at the time  Last problem  rear wheel drive  If you are somewhere icy  you probably know that a rear wheel drive vehicle is less stable  When I lived in TN during the ice storms  I had trouble in some areas and would fishtail  While a 360 is fun on purpose  it really sucks when it s an accident  Finally  my butt starts to hurt if I have to sit in the chair for more than 4 hours at a time So  who gets the car  Young people  single people  people with good driving records who can afford the insurance  If you aren t that person  or if you have more than two people you carry around with you on a regular basis  this isn t the car for you Update  Blew a head gasket at 100 000 miles  Apparently  the V6 also has a problem with this  And Ford knew about it and claims they sent out a service bulletin to inform owners  but they sent it to the wrong address and I never got it  I was just over the extended warranty on it and they wouldn t fix it  Repair would cost more than the car is worth
