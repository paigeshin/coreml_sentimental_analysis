 I have 13 367 miles on my 2000 Ford Focus ZTS  At first it was wonderful   25MPG and handled like a dream  That dream is now a nightmare  After 6 trips to various dealers  the car is now dangerous to drive   the car shakes violently if you attempt to stop at highway speeds  I purchased the car at Joe Myers Ford and they won t return my calls  Planet Ford refused to do anything  despite a letter from Ford Motor Company telling me to contact Planet Ford  Tomball Ford is only willing to service the car a SEVENTH time  Everyone I contact at Ford Motor Company doesn t deal with customers or if they deal with customers  they only take your name and number for the record  If you own a reliable Focus  then I envy you  I suggest you think twice before purchasing a Ford Focus  Ford doesn t take responsibility for its mistakes  UPDATE 10 2001 Tomball Ford took car and I now drive a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 instead  Ford provided assistance that ALMOST paid off the 2000 Ford Focus ZTS  as well as assistance toward a 10 year   100 000 mile extended warranty  and oddly enough  it s NOT a Ford ESP  With 0  financing I have a new car and lower monthly payments  I ll try to provide updates about the reliability of this replacement vehicle  I remain skeptical
