 This car has been a nightmare  It is currently sitting in front of my house with a tarp over it because the windows no longer work  or the locks  or the a c  or the headlights  Before you jump to conclusions about how i have abused the car  let me give you the cars history 1993  My dad bought a beautiful black t bird lx with red interior  Within a week of having the car the back tail light almost caught fire and has been broken since  The car was purchased in late november 1994  no problems  my dad barely puts any miles on the car 1995  babied as usual  car has always been washed at least once a week  and waxed roughly once every two months The car did require lower ball joints and brakes this year though  and an alternator  car still does not have 30k on it 1996  Not a bad year for the car  the door handle on the passenger side breaks loose this year though car still does not have 30k on it 1997 Car requires brakes again At 39 thousand miles the transmission goes out  the a c compressor also begins to whine a bit lower ball joints again this year the speedometer breaks also 1998  I purchase the car from my dad in february  I gut the stereo system install alarm  and new rims  The car begins to float all over the road  At 45k it needs tie rods  It also needs brakes again  and a sensor goes out and the car leaves me stranded  The door hinges on the drivers side actually brake in august of this year  Late that year the transmission has to be taken back 1999 This was a big year for the car  It took ford 1000 dollars worth of work to find the sensor that made the car shut off for no reason  Car once shut off while i tried to cross the street and i almost got hit by all three lanes of cars  the headlights die now both sides of the doors have broken loose  cant run the a c or the car will overheat  Another alternator  and the entire ignition need to be replaced  and a battery and more brakes and the car is almost impossible to keep in one lane while on the interstate  In late december the a c dies car has 68 thousand miles on it now 2000  In january the headlights die for the second time and i have to replace the blinker switch has headlight controls in it also In march the locks begin to stick on the doors and the front end has a terrible sound coming from it  in april i finally replace the rack and pinion lower ball joints and a few bushings for 862 dollars still no a c in car  3 days later it looks like it is going to rain for the first time in months  i go to roll up the windows  and neither of them work  the power locks no longer work  nor does the a c  In a rainstorm with a trashbag over the windows i sit in the car at a friends house  and replace the window switches  now one window works and still no locks  While driving the car home the headlights died for the final time and so did the radio final mileage  77 833 Cosmetically the car has no dents or scratches  and still shines like new The interior is spotless no rips in the leather  no stains  nothing  from reading the posts on this site  its half and half on the reliability  but overall these cars are a nightmare  I would not recommend buying a t bird to my worst enemy br br
