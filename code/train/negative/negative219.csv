 If you re looking for a commuter car  you ve found it  I own a 2door 94  Aspire with no options  This car is basically a lawnmower engine surrounded by sheet metal  My friends call it the Ford Expire because if you crash in it you re bound to die  I m sure that s totally exaggerated  Actually it has driver and passenger side airbags  That s about as sophisticated as the car gets  Traction is ridiculous  Those little BMX wanna be bike tires have hardly any surface area to touch the road  Therefore breaking distance is pretty bad  If you live in a cold climate forget about it  This car doesn t like snow at all  As for ice  It s like sliding an egg across a frozen lake  Power steering isn t needed  the care weighs close to nothing  A large group of friends can lift all four off the ground  I don t recommend it though  The interior is drab and cramped  Seats are uncomfortably stiff  The manual transmission won t agree with your passengers  The stick shift hits their knees in 5th gear  The back seat is enormous considering the size of the car  The back seats two adults quite comfortably for a small car  The instruments are easy to see even though they are few in number  The doors are an ugly plastic as is the rest of the interior  No carpeted doors or nice dash for this puppy  Now that I m done trashing the interior and tiny little tires  lets talk about performance  If you re really lucky  you might squeeze 60ponies out of that 4cylinder  You can floor it in just about any gear and not even feel the acceleration  Try passing someone on a highway and you re in for a shock  When you drop down to 4th gear and floor it  the only thing that happens is the engine hits a high pitched whine  and the car doesn t go any faster  Basically this car has no power  If that worries you  test drive it  You can t possibly image the lack of power in an auto until you try this one  Nothing I can say will prepare you for the feeling of helplessness you encounter on an onramp in heavy traffic  You ll be struggling to hit 50mph with cars whizzing past you at 65  Just close your eyes  cut into traffic  and pray someone slows down  It s not all bad though  This car does have one advantage  Maintenance  The engine is as reliable as they come  It can take quite a beating and keeps putting out that unheard of mileage  I average 50mpg on the highway and 40mpg in the city  Yup  that s 50mpg  With gas prices rising  that s an invaluable asset  On long highway drives I have even managed to get 55mpg  This comes at a cost though  Not only does the engine have no power as is  but in order to get these wonderful mileages  you have to sacrifice even more power and shift with the yellow light  The light is on the dash and tells you when to shift up  First gear is wound up so tight it ll blow the engine at a little over 5mph and kill your mileage on the way there  2nd can go to about 20mph or 25mph  but for gas you shift out of 2nd at about 10 or 15mph  3rd can go to about 40mph  but for gas it s 20mph  4th can go to about 60  at this speed the engine emits a high pitched whine  but for gas it s 35mph  5th gear has no power whatsoever  Notice a patern  You re in 5th gear by the time you re rolling  It takes forever to get to 55mph  and in the meantime you re only in the other gears for a few seconds  Nothing else on the car requires much maintenance  It s a noisy  unrefined egg with wheels  but it ll get you where your going  If you have a kid and are worried about him her speeding  this is their car  Believe me  The first time they try racing a friend  they ll be the laughing stock of their school  I ve been passed by a four wheeler before  The ride is bad  as is control  You ll be getting those little wheels balanced pretty often  Overall  it depends what you re looking for  If you re looking for a car  you don t want this  If you just want a means of transportation at a cheap price  this is your egg
