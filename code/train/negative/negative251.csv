 Why do I dislike the Ford Ranger  I purchased a 1998 Ford Ranger Super Cab  Things were great until I reached 37800 miles  2800 miles over the warranty  My Master Air Flow Valve went  My Driver side seat started falling apart  My Door Ajar light stays on  My Air Bag light on the dash board stays on  Well the Master air flow valve cost me  495 00  I am still fighting about the rest  When I asked the dealership about the Air flow problem they told me that this should not have gone  When I contacted Ford s Customer service all I received was 10 promises that either the dealerships manager would call or the Regional Ford Sales manager would call  Well that was in November of 99 and still no call  Trust me DO NOT PURCHASE A FORD  In my eyes they are not worth the problems  I am looking for a manufacture who stands behind there product  Perhaps a Toyota  Again please use extreme caution when buying from Ford  Quality is not JOB 1 at ford Sincerely
