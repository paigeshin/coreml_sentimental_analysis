 I drove a 91 explorer on a road trip from Texas to New York  I beleive it was a 2 wheel drive XLT model with all options except leather seats  This truck was nice in that it provided a nice view of the road  felt strong during all driving conditions  and provided more than the required cargo rrom for all of my gear  However  there was a huge downside to all of this  To put it as simply as it can be said the truck constantly felt like it was out of control  Braking distances were super long  it bobbed and wallowed over the smallest raod imprefections  and every turn made me wonder if a roll over was going to happen  Ford did a terrible job of engineering this thing  The wheel base is way too short and the center of gravity is way too high for a vehicle that is so massive  People are sort of lured into a fasle sense of security with these things  Just because it s classified as an SUV  they think tahy can do anything and go anywhere  The problems Ford and Firestone are having come as no surprise to me  The safetly issue when through my mind back in 1993  when I took the trip  Firestone my have designed a bad tire  but the trck is also to blame for so many deaths and injuries  On a typical passesnger car  a blown tire may cause a collision  but definately not a roll over  Usually the most danage suffered by a motorist with a blown tire is a damaged wheels  This is not so with this truck  The thing that is most shocking about this is how people have continued to buy this truck after the safety issues surfaced  I suppose that can be attrbuted to SUV s being status symbols instead of practical transportation  Face it  if you have children  admit that you do and dn t try to be all tough and rugged looking in one of these death traps  Money would be better spent of a station waggon of some type from a BMW 3 series  for the snooty sort  to the Volvo  for safety minded people  to American wagons  i e  taurus for economy buyers  I really hope the congressional hearings uncover some type of cover up by Ford and result in a massive recall where all Explorers are bought back from owners and scapped we will all be safer
