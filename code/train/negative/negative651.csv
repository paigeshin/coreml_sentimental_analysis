 My first new car purchase was a ZX2  I wanted a car that was economical on gas  I really liked the way it looked too  But sometimes looks can be deceiving  It s a snappy little car and it does get good gas mileage  But don t try to smoke a cigarette when it s raining out  The water drips right into the window  It s really a hassle  It s not from the rain coming from the sky either  it s the rain wiped from the windshield that gets you  Mostly it drips right onto the controls for the locks and windows  The tires on this car are 15 quot  This would not be a problem if you were not worried about the cost to replace them  They only last for about 20 000 to 30 000 miles  The cheapest tires I found were  91 00 and  supposedly  only Goodyear makes them  That is not very economical in my book  The cassette player died after 1 year  The passenger side window failed to close after 3 months  The ride is OK  The struts seem a little stiff even after a year of driving it  I think Ford could have done a much better job of creating this vehicle  Do your homework when buying any vehicle  Don t get stuck with an economical vehicle that costs too much to maintain br br
