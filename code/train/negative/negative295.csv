 I am a soccer mom  And I got this car at a discount  but if I were to do it over again  and I WON this car in a raffle  I d throw the keys away First let me say I ve driven this car for 18 months  so what I write  I write from experience  Some people may find the following complaints nit picky  But  I live in my car  I drive the kids to school  I pick them up  I go grocery shopping  shoe shopping  and clothing shopping   and except for food  none of it s my own  I shop online for clothes because there are simply not enough hours in the day to shop for me  And  yes  I go to and from soccer games and soccer practices for 2 of my 4 children  I spend a LOT of time in this car  If I could afford it  I would trade this in for almost anything else  but alas  the loan is still worth more than the car Now you know I hate it  This is why  cup holders  automatic door tracks  storage  keypad entry  3rd seat  gas mileage  snow  noise  and did I say cup holders Cup holders sounds like a trivial thing  but it s a big issue  There are two up front  They pop out with the ashtray  If you put in a heavy drink  whether a full water bottle or a coffee thermos  and you don t close the pinchers  the drink ends up on your foot  If it s heavy enough  it ll end up on your foot anyway the first time you make a turn  Also  I should note that if you want to recharge your cell phone of you have a passenger charging his laptop  he ll have to hold his drink  There is an additional port by the passenger  but it s so close to the floor that no cell phone could be used if plugged in and few laptop cords I own an SEL  It comes with a front console between the bucket seats  It has no additional cup holders in it  This is significant  SUVs often have a place for drinks on the console  Not the Windstar  There is no alternative place for cupholders for me  and no place to hold a drink for a kid who can t reach his her own cupholder  The SEL comes with 2nd row captain s chairs  The cup holders are near the floor of the chairs and flip down  Kids in carseats can t reach them at all  Younger children not in carseats still have trouble reaching them  Adults sitting in those seats have to grab the drink from the top  If it s a soda  or worse  coffee  from fast food  the top can and does pop off  The rear bench thankfully has decent cupholders  but they are the only ones  The Toyota Sierra has cup holders that fold into the sliding doors  Almost everyone else does NOT have the pinchers  With as much time as we spend in the car  it is unrealistic not to have the kids or me drink something at some part of the day  We get drinks spilled alot  Then the car starts to smell  It s amazing how fast and how bad a little orange soda or the smallest drop of a vanilla shake can smell  Don t discount this  Lack of useable cupholders is a big issue to anyone who drives   but especially those of us with children Automatic closing doors  The SEL has one on each side  The smallest piece of crayon  A stray nickel can keep it from closing  Sometimes these things get stuck in the track to the point where the door doesn t quite close  but can t then open easily either Storage  If you aren t using the third bench  the Windstar probably has plenty of room  I wouldn t know  I have 4 young children  Which means my options are either a minivan  with the 2nd and 3rd row intact or an extra large SUV  Anyone who owns an extra large SUV  and we do  knows that they are not the car that you take to zip in and out of busy parking lots  You may be able to park it  but you might have to choose which side of the car gets to exit  The doors are large and swing open wide  So  the third bench is stuck there  more on that later  That means there is less than 20 cu  ft of storage space behind it  That is peanuts folks  If I put an umbrella stroller back there  and that is the smallest version of stroller out there  I am hard put to fit a weeks worth of groceries in the back  If I put the stroller in the passenger compartment  then the kids trip on their way in and out  Even weekend trips tax our abilities to travel comfortably  You leave the umbrella stroller home  Add a portacrib  Give everyone a small duffle and that s it  You are out of room  Half the Windstars around here have luggage carriers permanently strapped to the roof with good reason Let s talk 3rd bench  It is big  It doesn t split in half  and it is heavy as hell  My oldest daughter lost her retainer in the car  I had to take out the third bench and both captain s chairs before I found it in the well of where one the chairs hooks in  I did it myself  I am a small but strong person  but I can tell you I hope I never have to do it again  Even with two people  getting the third seat out is unwieldy at best  And getting it back in is even worse  The manual sucks and the levers stick  And hope you never have to do it if you own one  Everything disgusting and vile congregates in those wells Keypad entry  All of Ford s SUVs have this feature  The SEL is the top of the line  It does not  If anyone is going to get locked out of their car  it s going to be a parent  Because their kid is going to close the door on them before they have removed the keys  Gas Mileage  If I m lucky I get 16 city and 17 5 highway  Not close to the 18 22 I live in a place that gets a lot of snow  It s an urban area and we have pretty good snow removal  The Windstar s version of ALLTrac isn t bad  However it s ground clearance is terrible  I have gotten stuck in parking lots and driveways where snow has built up by an exit or in the center of a lane  However  I think the ground clearance thing would be true of almost any Minivan Most of our relatives live a couple hours away  Once this car gets on the highway  it is LOUD  No joke  I don t hear as well out of my left ear  driver s window side  and with all the driving I do  I can t tell if it s from the car or the baby  who I usually carry on my left hip As I said  I have four small children  as in they would be crushed by airbags if they sat up front  I don t have a lot of choices in cars  And until I ve paid a little more off on my loan  I have no choices  Don t make the same mistake  The Grand Caravan has tons of room behind the third seat  I think almost twice as much as the Windstar  But if I was to get another Minivan  I think the Honda would be my car  That way  if I wanted to go to BJs  I could easily make the 3rd seat disappear  But  once this lemon is paid down  I m giving serious look at the Buick Rendevous  With the snow around here  Central Mass  I need something that can fit 4 kids easily  and please  NOT with a 2nd row seat that you have to pop up to get to the back bench  with more ground clearance that is still easy to park at the Soccer Field or the local Shop n Stop
