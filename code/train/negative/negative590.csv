 I got my 97 Escort brand new in 1997  I was in the market for something that would be easy to maintain  get me around good distances comfortably and be a good first car  I initially was looking at used cars  but decided that a new car would be good  since the warranty was a big bonus to me  having little knowledge about cars and car maintenance Within 15 000 km  I started having to double clutch to get into reverse about half the time  Yes  it s a manual transmission  and double clutching is when you take the car  which is not moving  from whatever gear you were in  into neutral  lift the clutch  depress the clutch again  and then engage it into reverse  I took it into the dealership I bought it from and asked them to look into it during some other routine maintenance  oil and air filter change  They only did the oil change that day  When I picked it up  I inquired about the air filter and the double clutching  They said they d have someone out to where my car was parked to show me how to use my transmission   and install the air filter  Well  the assistant service manager  I think that was his title  came out  He was very condescending  until he had to admit that  a  he didn t know what type of air filter my car needed   b  he didn t have the tools to remove the old one  and  c  he didn t know how to properly install the new one  This is really confidence inspiring After this amusing demonstration  he proceeded to tell me that first is a  magical gear    I m not making this up    and that I always need to put it into first before trying to put it in reverse  I explained that I usually have it in first  because I m usually going slowly before wanting to go in reverse  but I acknowledged that I might not always do that I went away  trying to be sure to always have it in first before putting it in reverse  I found that without double clutching  I often wouldn t be able to get it into reverse anyway  I took the problem back to the dealership  and same condescending attitude from another staff person  who proceeded to tell me  oh no  it s not first  it s second that is the magical gear  On my third complaint about it  I got the nice fellow who works behind the counter to admit that based on his experience driving my car  there was a problem getting it into reverse  I wish I d gotten it in writing  He no longer works there and I haven t been able to get it fixed Among the other  admitedly minor  problems and or complaints I ve had with the car include  no interior trunk release  I have to get out of the car  with the key  to unlock the trunk  after many service attempts  my car is still often hard to start when cold   I m sure my starter will have a shorter life because of the amount of time I have to engage it to get the engine to start  And I don t live in a cold climate  interior dome light only works intermittently  Upon complaining about it  they reluctantly replaced the light bulb in it  though I d repeatedly explained it wasn t the bulb  because it was intermittent Overall  I do have to say that I really like the little car  and I like the refinements Ford has made to the Focus which really improve on the Escort  However  after my service experience  there isn t a snowball s chance in Hades that I ll ever buy another  And don t get me started about how much it s worth now   I had a local Saturn dealership make a trade in offer on it  and I was very sad  and decided to keep the car a bit longer to get some value out of the depreciation I ll have to eat when I sell it Things I like about it  handling  gas economy  sharp look  if a bit cartoonish  comfy seats  trunk space  even in the sedan model br br
