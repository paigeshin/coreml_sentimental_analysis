 My husband fell in love with this car when he saw it on the Ford dealership s lot  We needed another vehicle  as I had totaled our Ford Taurus the previous month  This vehicle has a V 8  which both my husband and I enjoy  It also has all the little luxuries  the premium sound system  CD player  sun roof  keyless entry  leather seats  power seats  windows and locks  and automatic climate control  These little luxuries really make for a nicer driving experience  It truly was great until we had our daughter This car only has two doors  and putting her in and taking her out of the carseat can be difficult at times  If you re riding in the back seat behind someone who needs more leg room in the front you can get cramped if you re tall as well  It might be ok for short rides  but for longer trips it would be uncomfortable  The trunk space is also limited  This is fine if there s just one or two of you on a short road trip  If you re trying to go for longer distances with more luggage  forget it  I went to the airport one time to pick up my sister in law  and she brought two large suitcases  One would fit in the trunk  the other had to go in the back seat  Thankfully  at that point  we didn t have our daughter  and we could put the suitcase there  This was a great car for us before we had children  and will make a great car for my husband when we buy a more family friendly vehicle If you re single or a young couple without children  this would be great for you  If not  spend your money on a four door sedan or a mini van br br
