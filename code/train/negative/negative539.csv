 We leased this vehicle for 2 years  We began our lease in late 1997 just before our first son was born  thinking that it would be a great vehicle for kids  groceries  travel and all that First off it was an absolute pig on gas  Put your foot on the pedal and watch the gas gauge go down down down  It had guts  great passing power but you sure needed to feed it lots The 2 doors feature was kind of lame too  I would have changed that out of everything that I found wrong with it  Simply because getting a child in and out of a car seat is a real pain when you only have 2 doors  Then of course there were all the mechanical problems  From the electric seats breaking malfunctioning all the time making access to the back seat even harder  to the 4 wheel drive kicking on and off without notice  If the heating or cooling system was on while idling at a stop light you would hear this strange  quot clicking noise quot  which always made me nervous  This truck kind of reminds me of Windows 95 when it first came out it needed the bugs worked out before putting it on the market  And 4x4 it is not  I took my Explorer Sport onto a gravel road and down a somewhat steep and bumpy slope and I couldn t get back out without a lot of effort  My 1985 Toyota Land Cruiser makes the  97 Explorer look like a sorry excuse of a 4x4  that s for sure  And I could pretty much guarantee a flat tire each and every time I took it down a gravel road  5 flat tires in less that 2 years  I hear the tires on my truck have recently been recalled  so perhaps that had something to do with it The the paint began to peel off the front hood  the power windows would work some days and then not work the next  3 burnt out headlights umm should I go on Who should buy this vehicle  A Ford Mechanic I don t recommend it  Sure it looks good  and is fun to drive but who needs the headaches br br
