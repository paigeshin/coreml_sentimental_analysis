 My son bought this 93 ford ranger a month ago and I had my doubts  He found at a used car dealer dye s in grantsville wv  When he took me for a test drive I said that it seem to shift hard auto  He said That I found some thing wrong with every car he found  The dealer said that the transmission had been rebuilt That ranger transmissions were week and that they had put in a larger pump and it would last longer that way  My son asked him if transmission was warranted and yes it was  Are state requires a 30 day 50 50 warranty  Well the transmission slipped a few times and finally got worse  When my son asked him about it before the 30 days was up  The dealer said you probably should get a new trans  my son then went to the place that rebuilt the trans  They said some fluid leak was normal  They finally said would order a modulator valve and let him know  When a young college student works hard for their money this hurts more than you know  He checked the gas mileage without the air on and it got a dismal 18 miles to the gallon  It should be against the law for car dealers to make a vehicle that gets less than 30 miles to the gallon  SUMMARY don t buy a ford ranger if your interested in fuel mileage getting a good transmission  Talk to several people and see if they recommend dealer or not br br
