 If you do daytime only driving  the Ford Escort is the car for you  In the two years of owning the car  we had the pleasure of installing four headlamps and two taillights  This became my husband s hobby  I am distressed that since we have sold our Escort  my husband has no past time  He sits sullenly  looking at our non Ford Escort car  and he begs me to let him replace the working headlamps in that car  just for fun I m still trying to get my husband interested in Parcheesi The car was easy to get in and out of  once you pushed the weatherstripping back into place  The car held four people comfortably and the back seat was roomy  The blue color we chose seemed to be very popular in the Detroit area Only a four year old s tricycle has less power than the Escort  that is if Dad is not pushing the vehicle from the back  The engine noise was loud enough to drown out the words from the rider s in the back seat  and there were so many shake  rattle  and rolls in the body  even the mechanic that worked on the car shrugged his shoulders  and gave up trying to find the cause Driving this car is an enjoyable experience if it is the first car you have ever driven  and have nothing to compare it to I would recommend this car for the  quot little old lady quot  crowd that drives 3 miles to the store and back  every other Friday  around noon  during the brightest light of the day Anyone else takes the risk of needing a seeing eye car br br
