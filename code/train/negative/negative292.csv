 I don t like Fords as a matter of practice  You see   I ve had two really crummy experiences with them  My first was a 1997 Taurus  Problems started with that vehicle the first day I drove it home from the dealer and it needed a tow that afternoon  That was one of thirteen tows that vehicle needed in the 55 000 miles I put on the vehicle  and they never found the problem  The second problem is my current vehicle  the 1999 Taurus  which is in the shop as we speak due to a recall and several electrical problems that are being fixed under warranty I know  I know   I m supposed to be talking about a 2000 Ford Windstar  and that s exactly what this review is about  I m renting one  and have had one for the last week A Ford Windstar is a minivan  I must also state that I dislike minivans very much  I think  without being insulting  that they look dorky and they re made for exactly who I m not   a soccer mom The trimline on this Windstar is the SE package  It is your basic package  not a whole lot of bells and whistles are included  but it does have some nice creature comforts  The one thing I have never been able to complain about with Ford products is that they do make a rather comfortable vehicle This vehicle comes with a six cylinder 3 8 liter engine that produces 200 horsepower at 4900 rpm and 240 foot pounds of torque at 3600 rpm  It will climb hills  especially when you shut off the overdrive  By hills  I mean the Rocky Mountains of Colorado  which is where I live  It is advertised to get 18mpg in the city and 22mpg on the highway  Because I do a lot of mountain driving  I got far less gas mileage than what was advertised The transmission shifts gears smoothly  without any real jarring  In fact  I would say the transmission is as smooth as my Taurus  It is a comfortable shift of gears that is barely noticeable unless you floor the accelerator  This leads to a very smooth ride inside the van There is no flashy trim with this vehicle that would distinguish itself from any other minivan  although it does have a factory roof rack and molded bumpers  That s the extent of the fanciness outside Inside  it comes with two benches in the rear that not only fold down  but slide out of the vehicle totally  turning it from a passenger van into a cargo van  It does have an 1800 pound payload capacity  and you can fit furniture inside the cargo area with the seats removed It also has front and rear climate controls  which was a neat idea  The front passengers can control the temperature for the front of the vehicle  and the rear passengers can control the temperature back there  This is neat for children who sometimes complain that they are too hot or too cold This vehicle is also equipped with an AM FM cassette stereo  While the controls are simple to figure out  the sound is rather poor  I m not sure if that s something unique to the Ford Windstar or if that s something that s common in minivans  Either way  even hearing talk radio clearly means some heavy manipulation with the bass and treble controls Another funny thing with the stereo was that when I turn off the engine  the stereo keeps running  I can pull the key out  open the driver s door and close it and the radio still runs  This vehicle is equipped with an accessory delay  which allows you to manipulate the stereo and the windows after you ve already shut off the vehicle As an insurance adjustor  I ve never been a fan of this feature on cars  There are far too many things that can accidentally be done where a car owner can be sorry about later  Windows can inadvertently be opened and I don t trust electrical components   especially Ford electrical components   to work as advertised  Ford has a lousy history with me and their electronics The seats provide  plenty  of room inside  I certainly cannot complain about my six foot frame being cramped  I would say that a seven foot tall driver would run into a headroom problem  but legroom and headroom for me was not an issue On the other hand  the seats aren t comfortable  They are very stiff and thin for bucket seats  There is a plastic armrest that can be lifted and lowered  but it is at an unnatural position when in the lowered position  My arm feels like it is sitting far too high for comfort  I have chosen to keep the armrest up I noticed that the two passengers I took   both women   got in the passenger seat and immediately raised the armrest out of the way  so it isn t just me If you don t wear a seatbelt  the seatbelt indicator will stay lit  One thing I did notice as I was sitting at a drive through window at a McDonalds without my seatbelt on was after about twenty seconds  there is an annoying alarm that comes on telling you to buckle up  As far as I can tell  there s no way to shut up the alarm aside from buckling the seatbelt  This is a good feature for people like my dad  who for some reason refuses to buckle up The passenger bench seats are as comfortable as bench seats can be  They provide little support for the lumbar or the thighs  but then again I ve never been in a vehicle that does  While they do come out of the vehicle  they don t feel rickety and have a rather secure feeling Part of that secure feeling may come from a pain in the backside  literally  to take the seats out  It s supposed to be a simple process   you fold the seat down  tug on a hook on the floor  and the seat is supposed to slide right out  I don t claim to be the most mechanical person in the world  but it took some engineering thoughts on my end before I was successful in removing the seat from the floor The vehicle does come with power windows and power locks  The power windows are rather neat  The front windows go up and down just like in any other car  However  the back windows  pop  in and out  like van windows did  they just do it automatically  As far as I can tell  there is no way to raise or lower the rear panel window in the liftgate The liftgate does open straight up and is a single door in this model  While this is a tall vehicle  people of shorter stature  is that the politically correct term these days  should have little trouble reaching the liftgate in its open position  I have to give Ford credit for this feature There are two sliding passenger doors on this vehicle which makes for a very nice option  While I wasn t hauling around cargo or kids  I could see where this feature was a blessing  especially for cargo  It meant that with the rear seats out  you could slide the doors open and have someone pull from either direction to help load the vehicle  With the sliding doors  you can also park in very tight spaces and still gain access to the vehicle The doors do lead me to one major complaint  When I was growing up  my mother taught me that chivalry was not dead and that you open and close car doors for your women passengers  As I stated before  I had two different female passengers in this van The problem arises from the fact that some idiot at Ford chose to put the only outside key entry to this vehicle in the passenger door  While many vehicles these days have keyless entry  this particular van didn t  This meant I had two choices   I could leave the vehicle unlocked  which I am not a fan of  even if it isn t my car  or I could run over to the driver s side  unlock the door  open it to unlock all the doors and then run back to the other side of the van to open the passenger door Well  here s a newsflash  Ford  That s a lousy idea  You lose major points with me on that  even if most people would find that complaint silly Other features include power mirrors  a SecureLock anti theft system and dual air bags So  what are my recommendations  Well  I d say if you want a comfortable ride in a minivan  then the Ford Windstar is for you  If you want a comfortable minivan  you may want to look elsewhere  I m pretty annoyed with the idea that there s no passenger door entry lock  I don t like the accessory delay feature  and I don t like the strangely placed armrests for the front seats I m going to be generous and give the Windstar three stars out of a possible five  For me  that s a good rating on a Ford  For a vehicle in general  that s a mediocre rating overall br br
