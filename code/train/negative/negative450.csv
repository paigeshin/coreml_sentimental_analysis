 About a year ago  my twin brother bought a 1994 taurus with about 115K on it for  4000  It seemed like a pretty nice car when we test drove it  so he bought it and it turned out to be a pretty cool car  his looks better because he added a spoiler  bra  and some chrome wheels  It is a sharp looking car  but he ended up having some problems with it POWER the 3 0L V6 is not one of ford s best engines  though somewhat powerful in lighter cars it seems at some times strained by the weight and size of the massive taurus  It does ride pretty smooth though  About 3 months after he got it  the heater core went out  It was a 400 dollar repair  Soon after they replaced that  the air conditioning wouldnt stay cold  They replaced the freeon  and it was cold  for about a week  apparently there was a leak or some type of problem  About another 300 to replace that MILEAGE His taurus does not get good mileage at all  at one time it was getting only about 10 in the city  Sure  driving with a lead foot was part of the problem  but 10 is still TOO low for a car with an engine of that type  He had the oxygen sensors  there are 2 of them in tauruses  for about 250  and that made it improve by about 2 or 3 mpg  Still not very good  only about 200 on a full tank RIDE COMFORT It is indeed a comfortable cruiser  The one thing i didnt like is there was no p ower seat  so after being used to the one in my car  92 Lumina EURO  it seemed kind of flat  The car rides pretty smooth  and takes the bumps pretty well  I have driven this car and I do not like the way it handles  The complete opposite of my car  It is kind of a fake feel  by that i mean there is no real feel for the road  You can move the wheel with your pinky finger  Some people may like that  he does  but not me  Cornering could be better  At low speeds the Taurus can pull U turns and sharp corners easily  Once you get above 15 or 20 the car sways excessively  Bigger tires would help  although the 15 s are ample STYLING Tauruses are sharp looking  although kind of bland  If you like a car that isnt very sporty looking and that blends in with the crowd  then they are for you  I dont reccomend this car  Apparently other tauruses have been known to have transmission problems that are very costly  If you want a similar sized and similar priced car that has been proven to be more reliable and just a better car  then i recommend you check out the Chevy lumina  just a 92 94  91 s had brake trouble Altogether it s not a bad car  Some like it  some dont  It has been known to have some trouble  but there are many cases of people not having any trouble at all  I dont really recomend it just because I feel there are better cars in the early 90 s 4 door sedan market
