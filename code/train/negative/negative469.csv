 I loved driving this van  I would probably still be driving it if Ford was a responsible and reputable company  At 80 000 miles my van started showing the classic symptoms of pending head gasket failure  My dealer service manager discovered the problem but could offer me no financial assistance even though he agreed the failure was premature and identical to the problem on various  94    95 model vehicles for which Ford had issued extended 100  coverage warranties  I spoke with the district office as well as the main customer service office in Detroit to no avail  Ford d only answer was that if I could show where assistance had been provided to other owners of  96 or later vehicles in a similar circumstance  they would try to offer assistance  I got rid of the vehicle before the failure occurred  Avoid any Ford vehicle with a 3 8 liter engine  Also  Ford has a continuing problem with faulty defective transmissions  Of my friends and family members who drive drove Ford vehicles with 3 8 liter engines  the following can sum up the experience co worker on his 4th engine and 2nd transmission  in law on her 2nd engine and 3rd transmission  cousin on 2nd engine   also had  2000 damage repair from defective subframe failure
