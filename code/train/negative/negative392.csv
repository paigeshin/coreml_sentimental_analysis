 I have had the opportunity to drive several Ford Tauruses through business travel  I have driven both the 1999 Ford Taurus SE and the 2000 Ford Taurus SE First off  I have to admit that I am not a Ford fan and am not in the market for a sedan such as the Taurus  But I have to say that the Taurus would be a decent family car for those who would like to get a decently equipped car for around  20K b Exterior  The design folks at Ford have obviously realized what an  oval all  disaster the last generation of Tauruses were  The oval shape was everywhere  from the headlights  the taillights  the grill and even the rear window  For 2000  the Taurus has moved away from the radical oval design in favor of a some sharper angles which give the car a more elegant look  Most importantly  the ugly mass of oval rear lights have disappeared  being replaced by some simple angular tail lights b Interior  Gone as well inside the car  thankfully  is the large oval climate control   radio combination  Ford still misses the mark by providing a  though more attractive  single unit climate control   radio center  The seats are your typical American car softer and ample sized seats  The power driver s seat allows a good driving position to be found  The rear seats appear to provide plenty of seating space for three adults  including decent leg room  The one interior fixture in the car that I absolutely disliked was the center armrest seat console combination  I just believe that there is no such thing as a true three passenger front seating area  unless maybe you are driving a 1970 Cadillac Eldorado or something  and feel that most car companies do a lousy job at attempting to do so  The largest person that could sit comfortably in this space is about a five year old child  The storage console is one like those overstuffed sectional couches with fold down cupholders  I imagine those who own those type of couches would appreciate this feature in this car  Other than that  the car is well equipped with power windows and door locks  cruise control and a neat control that allows you to adjust the pedals forward and backwards  which is good for really short drivers  My overall impression of the interior was that it had a really sort of modular plastic feel to it  There were places where plastic switch plates were placed on top of the plastic door panels  rather than having the pieces fit together nicely with a minimal seam  But  for 20K  I don t think that there is much to complain about b Driving  I wasn t really impressed driving this car  Sure  it is relatively quiet on the road and the car eats up imperfections in the road  but it is just not a FUN car to drive  But I suppose those who are buying this car are less concerned about this  I though that the 1999 model felt more powerful than the 2000 model  The 2000 model seemed a little sluggish with the standard V6 engine  I have learned that car manufacturers don t offer bigger engines for no reason at all  If you have the extra cash  opt  for the larger V6 engine  Since this car seems to have been designed with a more comfortable ride in mind  the car handles with a bit of a bloated feeling  especially on freeway on and off ramps b Summary  I personally wouldn t buy this car  but like I said  I m not in the market for this type of car  And if I was  I would rather shell out a few thousand more for the VW Passat   Sorry  I am a VW fan  It just doesn t have anything about it that makes me want to buy it  But the rental car agencies seem to like them and there are plenty of them on the road  so some people must like what Ford has turned out with the Taurus  But if you are looking for just a plain old family car  one that has a good safety rating and is decently equipped for around  20K  check out your local Ford dealer br br
