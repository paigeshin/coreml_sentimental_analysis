 My Ford Taurus experience began in October of 1999 when I purchased the car for around  2000  I was attending Stonehill College in Easton  MA at the time and needed a vehicle to drive to Quincy  MA where I live  At first the car was reliable and drove fine  but after a few months the problems started Here is a chronological list of the problems I have had over the last 2 and a half years b Jan  2000   regulator broken  The car will not start I have this fixed b Apr  2000   car rattles  Mechanic thinks it is the struts  but I do not need to replace them b June 2000   AC broken  Just in time for the summer  I have this fixed b Feb  2001   Alternator broken  I have this one fixed b Aug  2001   Problems shifting into reverse  The car takes a few seconds to shift into reverse  I m told there is a problem with my brakes  but it is not too critical b Aug Feb  2002   Reversing problem gets worse  Mechanic tells me that my brakes are the problem  New brakes are supposed to fix the problem b Aug  2002    280 brake work  Car still has problem shifting into reverse  Mechanic now tells me that it is my transmission  Estimated price for repair is  1500 That value of my car is only  1000 at best  so repairing it is pointless  I continue to drive the car as of June 13th  2002  but the transmission gets worse every day  Currently the car is at 125 000 miles The thing that was surprising to me about the Taurus is that two of my friends Taurus  died when the transmissions went  One died at around 75 000 miles and the other at 125 000 miles I am no expert when it comes to cars  but from my own personal experiences with the Ford Taurus and that of my friends  I would highly recommend seeking another type of automobile  From my current understanding  the Ford Taurus is not built to last and if you have one  expect the transmission to die Good luck
