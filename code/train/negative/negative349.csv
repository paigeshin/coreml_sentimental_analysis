 Is that a truck or a tank  Its an ok car for a big family  but has no room in the trunk for anything  Its a very tiny space  Also  the gas bill is very high because it has a really big tank to fill the gass  There are good things to the car though  It has a lot of room for the children and yourself  Another  thing is that its a high up car if u like to be high up  The bad thing is though that it is a very big car and can put smaller cars in danger if the get in an accident  Make sure you make a really good decision before you buy the car
