 The Ford Mustang was redesigned for 1994  although it was still based on a modified Fox chassis  called Fox 2  that dated back to 1979  Hatchbacks were discontinued  but coupes and convertibles remained  Compared to the previous generation  the  94 Mustang was longer  wider  and lower  The weak four cylinder engine was also discontinued  A 145 horsepower V6 engine was standard  while the GT used a 215 horsepower V8  A Borg Warner T5 5 speed manual transmission was standard  an electronically controlled 4 speed automatic optional  Although all Mustangs for 1994 had 4 wheel disc brakes  anti lock brakes were optional  Convertibles included a power top and glass rear window  with an optional rear defogger  Mustang Cobras came with a powerful 5 0 liter 240 horsepower V8  and were sold in limited numbers  With a stiffer suspension than ordinary Mustangs  Cobras came only with a 5 speed manual and had standard ABS as well as a slightly different styling b EXTERIOR   The Mustang s pony car styling was redesigned for 1994 with a sexy  more rounded body  This years body styling is a far cry from the boxy angular Mustang that debuted in 1979  The front hood vents look nice  but serve no purpose  The Cobra s 5 spoke 17 inch alloy wheels look great  The standard GT wheels look okay  but I prefer the Cobra s b INTERIOR   My test GT made a LOT of noise  If wind noise is not intruding at speeds above 65 mph  then the rather loud exhaust engine noise is  The interior looks very old school with cheap looking hard plastic everywhere  The controls are easy to use and reach  Build quality is sub par  The front seats are comfortable enough for long drives  but for tall people like myself  there is just not enough leg room to stretch out and be REALLY comfortable  I like the GT s power lumbar support feature  optional  It makes the seats even more hospitable  The long  heavy doors are a nuisance in tight spaces and when parked sideways on hills The rear seats are very small  There is absolutely no leg room for the long legged and even people about 5 feet 5 inches will feel confined  The mere act of entering the backseat requires a gymnastic that most people will find a hassle  Just to get in  you have to duck under the low roofline  or risk bumping your head  squeeze between the seat and the doorjamb  and be prepared to have your knees digging into the driver s or front passenger s seat  if you are tall  Trunk space is insufficient for everyday living  If you plan on keeping a Mustang as your weekend sports car  then there is enough room to carry a few golf bags and other stuff b ENGINE   The standard engine is a 3 8 liter OHV pushrod V6 engine that produces 145 horsepower at 4 000 rpm  and 215 lb ft  of torque at 2 750 rpm  It is available with either a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic  The V6 when paired with either transmission is adequate enough for most situations  but I did notice that when paired with the automatic  it was a little reluctant to downshift  The GT comes with a more powerful 5 0 liter OHV pushrod V8 engine  It makes 215 horsepower at 4 200 rpm and 285 lb ft  of torque at 3 300 rpm  With either transmission  the torque comes on very quickly  but has the tendency to run out of breath after about 5 000 rpm  Other than that  there is more than enough passing power and a LOTS of low end torque  The Cobra uses a modified version of the GT s V8 and produces 240 horsepower at 5 000 rpm  but the same 285 lb ft  of torque at a higher 4 000 rpm  Although the Cobra never feels weak at low rpms  its engine was tuned for more mid range torque and all but eliminates that weak top end feeling that ruins the GT model s fun  I averaged 15 7 mpg on the recommended premium fuel  but Ford says mid grade 89 octane fuel is reasonable b HANDLING   There is more than enough lateral grip in the corners  and overall is very fun to fling around corners  There is more body lean than expected in ALL models but nosedive is serious only on the base and GT models  I feel the steering wheel could be stiffer than it is on the base and GT models  but the Cobra s is nicely weighted for sporty driving  Unfortunately  all Mustangs of this model year have the tendency to have their tail ends  skip  around bumpy corners  All Mustangs have a problem when it comes to handling in wet weather  All models spin the tires when trying to come up a hill after a stop if you are not very careful with the throttle  Snow practically immobilizes the Mustang b RIDE   With a longer wheelbase and a few extra hundred pounds than the  93 model  the ride is still stiff  but not as jarring as before  The GT s suspension is poorly damped  and feels like it is crashing over large bumps  Even on apparently flat  smooth roads  you can still feel the GT jumping on occasions  picking up even the smallest road imperfection  Although the Cobra model has a stiffer suspension  it rides very much the same as the GT b RELIABILITY   Unfortunately  my test GT was plagued with problems  The owner received 4  no  that is NOT a typo  recalls during his entire ownership of the car  For more info about these recalls visit this website http www nhtsa dot gov cars problems Not to mention the trouble spots  There is a chattering noise that can be felt coming from the rear during tight turns after highway driving  I read that this is caused by a defect in the clutch packs in the Traction Lok  PosiTrac  differential  My test GT came with the automatic transmission  When I put it in OverDrive  it had the tendency to slip  and then the engine would flare to rather high rpms depending on how hard the gas pedal is pressed  According to the owner  when the Mustang had about 70 000 miles on it  the transmission did the same thing  He said that he had replaced it with a rebuilt automatic transmission that had 50 000 miles on it and within 5 000 miles  started acting up again  Make sure that if you decide to buy a Mustang GT with an automatic transmission  have a dealer check it for any problems b VALUE   All Mustangs deliver good performance at a reasonable price and should be an attractive buy for anyone at any age  The V6 model is more of a daily driver than the Cobra or GT  but is not as quick  If you shop for a V8 model  it would be wise to have another car in your garage for when the weather gets wet or you need the cargo room to haul
