 I bought the 95 Ford Windstar due to our 2 year old daughter and our future children  My husband and I previously owned a Dodge Caravan we loved  We found the Windstar for a great price  8000  with 89 000 miles Lots of miles but looked in good condition  The van was great for the first 2 months then it got crazy  First trouble with the air which turned out to be the computer  500  Then it started overheating  We checked the thermostat no problem  On the way back from the beach we blew the head gaskets  1200  And now the transmission is acting iffy  And at this point we have so much money invested in the car we can t sell so we are stuck driving it until it dies  We had read Consumer Reports before we bought the van and it checked out  Unfortunately we didn t wait long enough because now it s coming out that it s a lemon  So buyer beware br br
