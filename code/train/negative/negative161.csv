 The Taurus I am driving is a company car assigned to me a little over 2 year ago  The following information should be useful for someone who is considering purchasing one as a used car EXTERIOR  3 My white Taurus looks like an albino sperm whale  The rounded windshield  rounded rear window  bug eyed headlights  and the smiling mouth grill opening combine to make this a cartoon of a car INTERIOR  5 The interior appears to be well thought out with one exception  the terrible ergonomics of the front seats  There is no lumbar support or side support  I ve developed chronic aches in my shoulders from leaning on the fold down center console and the inside of the driver door  I am 5 5 quot  and weigh 125 lbs  Perhaps the seats were designed for much wider drivers  Three of my colleague  of various girth  who also drive the Taurus complained the same of the GL s base seats  Other than the seats  The rest interior is very roomy and quiet at any speed  Headroom and legroom are plentiful  The dash is made of high grade plastic and rattle free even after 75 000 miles  The trunk will swallow just about anything even plywood with the rear seats folded down  The lift over height may be low  but the wide tail lamps reduced the trunk width ENGINE  8 The 3 0 liter V6 accelerates very nicely and provides excellent fuel economy for a full size car nearly 30MPG freeway HANDLING  8 Sometimes forgetting that this is not a sports car  I would take some curves too fast  The Taurus is very forgiving  however  in response with some body roll and tire squeals  Very good handling for an American sedan RELIABILITY  3 My company purchased about 20 of these vehicles and reliability has become an issue  One Taurus  definitely a lemon  was in the shop 3 times within a one year period for the same problem  The engine would just quit while cruising on the freeway  The dealership replaced several electrical components before the problem went away  At approximately 60 000 miles most of these cars began experiencing transmission  quot slips or lurches quot  We spent  1200 on one of these  Just last week  the mass air flow sensor  some component for emissions control and engine regulation  went out on mine  The part itself costs  400 VALUE  4 The depreciation on the Taurus is horrendous  from  20 000 to  5000 in four years THE VERDICT  A VERY GOOD CAR WHEN NEW WITH UPGRADED SEATS Don t purchase this as a used vehicle unless you are a mechanic or have a mechanic buddy
