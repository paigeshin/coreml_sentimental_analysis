 I always wanted  quot The Mustang quot  And a convertible to boot  I bought this car after a divorce and I wanted something with some muscle and I wanted to go topless  These turned out to be the best parts of this machine  I liked the power it had although it needed more  and it gets a lot of looks on the freeway from the opposite sex  maybe because it was red  or topless Who cares  It is fun to drive most of the time  I have not been totally pleased with the performance of this car  The first year it seemed to have a lot more power than it does 4 years later  I understand that an engine will lose some power  but I feel a significant loss in mine  It has been serviced well by the way  so I don t feel that it is the problem  It has also been in the shop a lot for some steering problems and items that should have lasted longer than they did  I like the tightness of the car and the steering  It reminds me of the 79 Trans Am if anyone has ever driven one  This car left me longing for much more power though  and I think I would shop around more the next time I want a sports car  If you want looks and a fun car to drive  you probably can t go wrong but of you want speed and performance  then look again  Also  I do not recommend an automatic in this car  You lose a lot of power and performance as well as my transmission is going out at only 100 000 miles maybe that s why I call her  quot Christine quot
