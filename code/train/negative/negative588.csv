 Unlike the fellow who reviewed an 84 Crown Vic by owning an 86 model  I can give you the real story  First  the car has a good ride on dirt roads and a huge  ten dead body sized trunk  It also has a bunch of crush space to absorb collision impact  The lack of road feel is a positive thing  both in rural areas and over city potholes They look alike on the outside  but the 1984 model has demonstable shortcomings  My experience is based upon getting to borrow my mom s 1986 Crown Victoria  which is a wonderful car except for the front bench seat  and subsequently buying a 1984 Crown Victoria  thinking that I would be getting the same critter  The earlier car is a boat anchor that has occupied space in the yard for the weedeater to trim around  while the 1986 model has soldiered on trouble free The 1984 has an igniton module that simply quits going down the road  It also has the aggravating characteristic of testing out all right on the test bench  but not working in the car  The 86 model has a different system  The fuel injector is a throttle body type in the 84  and a tuned port type in the 86  which is far superior in driveability and economy  The seat back broke inside  and it won t stay upright  The seat has absolutely no lumbar support  which is verified by driving mom s 86 model  which is not broken  Also  the car has 14  wheels  which makes finding used tires large enough difficult My car was really cheap  with no body damage and only 80 000 actual miles  but it was no bargain because it s ignition and fuel injection systems were badly designed  I have only gotten a few miles out of it while mom has gotten another 50 000 with hers without a hitch  Her car gets pretty good mileage  has 15  wheels  and has better acceleration  Of course  mine has no acceleration most of the time  execept behind a tow truck Don t buy an 84  Get an 86  which is a fishing car beyond comparison  if you want cheap transportation with room for your XXL buddies and all their gear
