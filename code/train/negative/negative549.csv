 I recently was in the market for a used  SUV  I went to the Ford dealer  to see what was in their used car stock  The salesman told me they had just received a 97 explorer on a trade  and he thought the car was in excellent shape  I took his word for it  and took the car out for a test drive  Let me tell you  this car was from from good shape  It drove terribly  The steering was loose and out of control  the engine sounded like it was going to explode  and the acceleration and power were nowhere near what i expected them to be  I told the slaesman what i thought and walked out of the dealership  That testdrive indicated to me fords quality  and their desire not to have you pleased with your car  but to make a sale no matter what
