 This car is a lemon  plain and simple My wife and I bought the car in April 2001  to replace an Escort that had just ended it s lease  and we had no trouble with Brake problems Within the car s first week  the brakes were grinding  We took it in to the dealer  where we were told  That s normal  Focuses do that Within 6 000 miles  the front and rear brakes needed to be replaced  Originally the Ford dealer tried to charge us for the repair  but after arguing for about an hour and having to explain to them why the rear brakes should NEVER have to be replaced after 5 000 miles  they finally did the work as warranty 14 000 miles  we had the same problem  Again  the dealer tried to charge us to fix the brakes  and again we refused  The dealer went so far as to suggest that the problem is that my wife drives the car most of the time  and since she s a female she was probably  feathering  the brake pedal causing them to wear out quickly 20 000 miles  we had to replace front and rear brakes AGAIN  This time  At a different dealer  they put on heavy duty brake pads and rotors that have lasted so far  50 000 miles on the car now  They tried charging us for the work  but I went in with a stack of about 100 pages of printouts from http www fordfocusbrakeproblems com and the NHTSA website of customer complaints exactly like ours  They finally comped the service Poor mileage Ford bills this car as an economy car  We ve NEVER gotten over 22mpg average on a tank of gas  We took it back to Ford after having the car for about a month  and they told us that is normal  We asked why the window sticker said it would get over 30mpg  but was getting under 20 at the time  They said the sticker is just an estimate  and cars usually get far less than the window sticker says We took the car back to two other dealers for the same fuel mileage problems  and not once could they identify a problem After the car s warranty expired  I looked into it myself  Within half an hour  I found a vacuum tube coming from the exhaust manifold that had been manufactured with a hole in it  I replaced the tube with a new one  and the car instantly ran better and started getting about 5mpg better  Not one of the three dealers I had taken the car to was able to find it Other problems we ve had Radio turns itself off and on occassionally  usually on long trips  We ve had the radio replaced twice  with no success Passenger side headlight burns out after about a week  It just started doing this about a month ago  but I m not bothering trying to fix it since I m turning the car in this week A thumping noise comes from the front suspension when going over bumps  There was a recall for this  and I took it in  The thumping stopped for a few months  but started up again  Ford claims they can t hear it Our rear passenger side window fell into the door a few weeks ago  and of course it did it while it was pouring down rain  I had to try to fix it in the rain too  The cable that pulls the window up and down is attached by a flimsy plastic piece that broke off  The window is currently being held up by a piece of wood I wedged inside the door Our transmission will downshift for no reason  I ve had the car on cruise control  on a flat freeway  and the transmission will downshift itself  race the engine for a few seconds  and then upshift again  It does this pretty frequently On the freeway  the plastic moulding around the rear wheelwell came loose and was barely hanging on  I had to stop  and snap the piece back on The passenger side air bag cover has started opening up three times  All three times  we had to take the car in and they fixed it The a pillar trim on the driver side came loose  and was about to fall off  The dealer replaced it Both rear seatbelts have malfunctioned  The passenger side seatbelt doesn t latch securely  and will often times undo itself  The driver s side rear seatbelt will often lock after being pulled out about 12 inches  which makes it useless and unuseable  When it does that  it will stay locked for several hours  so anyone sitting there can t use the seatbelt on that trip  Of course the Ford dealers were unable to duplicate either of those problems Our trunk opens itself randomly  We ll be driving down the street  and the door ajar light will come on  The Ford dealer claims that is impossible  and told me that I was probabbly accidentally hitting the trunk release button on the dashboard without knowing it Our windshield was hit by a small piece of gravel on the freeway  Instead of creating a small pit  it caused a large crack that runs across the entire windshield  This thing has a horrible resale value  In late 2003  the Kelly Blue Book wholesale value of the car is about  4 500  That s for a 2 5 year old car that started out costing  13 000 more The only good thing about this car is it is pretty roomy for a small  economy  car  I m 6 3  and fit fairly comfortably in it If you want to read hundreds of

investigations Three days ago we bought a 1996 conversion van to replace the Focus with  We have almost a year left on our lease  but we opted to pay the remainder of the lease off so that we could get into something safer and more reliable  As soon as we get the check from the bank to pay off the Focus  it will be going back to Ford  Good riddance
