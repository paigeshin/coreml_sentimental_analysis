 In 1992 we bought a new Taurus and we really loved it  So in 1999 we decided to try a new Taurus  I did not care for the style of the newer version  but bought it anyway I do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other one  Thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room  I do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting It drives nice and has good pick up  But you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficult  It has a very small gas tank I would not buy a Taurus if I had it to do over  I would rather have my 1992 back  I don t think the style is as nice as the the 1992  and it was a mistake to change the style  In less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire br br
