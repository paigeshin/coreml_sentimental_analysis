 I bought this vehicle in October of 1999 mostly because I was coerced and bullied by the salesmen at my local Ford dealership  I liked the looks of it  but  being my first new car  was extremely naive in how to go about purchasing one  I had looked at a few other cars  such as the Sebring  the Dodge Stealth  used  the Camaro  and the Avenger but never had the chance to really think about it and decide which one I liked best  Anyway  since then I have decided that I would never buy another Ford Mustang and would not recommend it to anyone  First of all  the pickup on the V6 engine is lame at best for such a  quot sports quot  car  Secondly  the interior is the most poorly designed that I think I have ever seen  Let s start with something as trivial as the cup holders  They have situated it so that the larger of the two holders is furthest back  but it is so large the the average cup inevitably spills every time  The smaller of the two holders holds the cup comfortably  however it is so close to the stick shift that it makes it impossible to put a drink in it without knocking it over in the process of shifting gears  Then  the seatbelt holder sticks out so far that as soon as you sit in the seat  it hits the side of the door   1 locking the door  and  2  creating a dent in the plastic on the door  The legroom is cramped and tall people have a very difficult time riding in my car  The high beam device turns on opposite  you have to push it away from you rather than pulling it towards you like a normal car  to every other car that I have ever driven  which is frustrating when you try to pull it towards you out of habit  The trunk is pretty good sized  but don t try to put a large suitcase in there  because the distance between the edge and the top is so small it prevents you from being able to get it in there  I ll admit that it s a pretty car  but that s about it
