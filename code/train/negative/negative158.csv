 The Ford Aerostar minivan is one of the worst minivans ever made It s not dependable  it constantly needs repairs  and is not something you want to stare at  The only good thing about it is it s engine selection You can choose between a 4 cylinder  a 4 0 V6 or a 3 0 V6  I have a 3 0 version  When it s working it has good acceleration and horsepower  It has seating for seven and a large cargo area  It doesn t get good mileage and it gets pushed around by the wind It burns up master cylinders and transmissions  I personally would like to set mine on fire because it is not running well  My Aerostar s air conditioning hasn t worked in two years  Over all this van is not a very good vehicle br br
