  B ack when the Ford Focus was introduced in late 1999 as a 2000 model it boasted many attributes that surpassed the competition  It had bold styling  a modern interior with plenty of amenities  a good price  and good fuel economy  Fortunately for us  the consumers  and unfortunately for Ford Motor Company other cars such as the Toyota Matrix  Suzuki Aerio followed in the Focus s footsteps and created an equally if not better automobile to compete b For 2002  the Ford Focus Sedan comes in 3 trim lines  the LX  the SE  and the ZTS  While a 2 0 SOHC engine that produces 110 hp is standard on the LX and SE models  my test SE sedan was equipped with a 2 0 DOHC Ztec 4 cylinder  The ZTS sedan comes standard with the DOHC Ztec engine  The 2 0 Ztec puts out a healthy 130 horsepower at 5 300 RPM and 135 lb ft of torque at 4 500 RPM  2 transmissions are offered this year  a 5 speed manual and a 4 speed automatic  which was equipped on my tester i Driving Impressions i Off the line  acceleration  is disappointing  Having the 130 horsepower Ztec engine I was expecting close to the same performance of the old Escort ZX2 or the 2000 ZX3 5 speed  which had the same engine  The automatic transmission really hampers any sort of rush in power  and when accelerating hard or even slightly hard the engine makes quite a bit of noise  Since the Ford Focus SE s Ztec engine gets its peak torque at a relatively low RPM  take offs are adequate  but that s it  nothing exciting  just adequate  The 4 speed fully automatic transmission plays a big role in this lackluster performance  At times I could have sworn I was driving a car with a 10 year old transmission  clunking into gear  and odd shifting patterns were common   Handling  in the 2002 Ford Focus SE Sedan was quite impressive  as it was back in its introduction year  The Focus SE remains composed at almost all times  and is surprisingly controllable through hard turns  The suspension made this small sedan very nimble and relatively fun to drive on the twistys   Cruising  in this sedan is also quite good  The ride is firm and sporty  yet does not jolt the driver or passengers from their comfortable seating positions  Cruising at 65 70 MPH can be a little loud with the wind  engine and road noise  but unless you are  super picky  it won t bother you enough to change your buying decision  Hills are taken with a little strain  the 4 speed automatic will down shift on steep inclines  and the engine will get quite loud  but you definitely will not be left in the far right lane on those 10 lane hilly freeways   Braking  is average  my tester came with the  so common  front disc rear drum set up with no ABS so braking was not a grand offering  but they did do their job of stopping this small sedan with little fuss   Fuel economy  is average for a car in this class  the EPA rates this car at 26 31 MPG with the Z tec engine mated with an automatic transmission   Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the 2002 Ford Focus SE is very edgy new wave  The dash board is very distinctive yet offers good good ergonomics and easy to read instrumentation  Even despite not having a tachometer the instrument cluster is well designed with plenty of useful gauges  While the interior of the Ford Focus is almost all plastic  the plastic looks good  and is much less plasticy looking many cars in this category  Amenities are plentiful with the comfort Ztec package  600    Amenities include AC  CC  keyless entry  power windows and locks  tilt steering  an Am Fm CD player that you will probably want to replace  cup holders  front air bags  and more  The front bucket eats are made of a cheap cloth but are surprisingly comfortable  These seats offer height adjustments and adequate support  Room is average  plenty of room up front  but the rear 60 40 split folding seats will most likely offer a cramped environment for rear passengers  The Focus however does boast plenty of rear headroom  and the trunk is spacious enough for 1 weeks worth of groceries i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  of the Ford Focus Sedan remains unchanged since its introduction in 2000  While once considered an  eye catcher  the Focus now blends in with a profusion of other look alike cars  i e  Suzuki Aerio  The exterior  like the interior is very edgy with long triangular headlamps in front and more pudgy triangular tail lamps   Price  Reliability    Warranty i  The 2002 Ford Focus SE Sedan with the comfort Ztec package comes to almost  16 000  Since this is the middle of the year Ford is offer some good APR rates  The Ford Focus has been a reliable car since its introduction  and the Ztec has been a reliable engine since 1997  If anything does happen to your 2002 Ford Focus Ford offers an unimpressive 3 year  36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty  and an extended warranty at an extra cost Looking for a more refined economy car  Check out my review on the    a href content 74102312580
