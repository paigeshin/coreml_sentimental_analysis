 I had a 90 Ford Taurus wagon which I just got rid of  The reason  it cost more to repair the car than it was actually worth  So  we donated it to a local school  and the car s problems will be fixed  and it will be washed and waxed and hopefully whoever gets the car will be very grateful  After all  it was one of those  quot low mileage cream puffs quot  It only had 28 500  The first seven years were totally trouble free  but in late 96 early 97 it began to develop problems  The digital speedometer  always a mistake  and automatic climate control began to fail  There was some leak in the line to the speedometer  causing it to suddenly register  quot 0 quot  while driving down a highway  And the climate control system would blow either too little or too much air it was basically as uncooperative as possible  That Spring  the transmission began to have problems  It was mainly having problems going from first and second gear  but it got so that we had to manually shift the car from first to second  So  we took it into the shop  and they claimed to fix the transmission  but of course  it was a Ford dealership  and they basically lied to us  They temporarily fixed the climate control  but it broke again  Things were OK until December of 98  when the drivers side power seat simply failed  I was never too confident in the design  especially considering how much stuff is hanging down below that seat  it just doesn t look as well designed as other power seat systems I ve seen  And  finally in May of 1999  a head gasket blew  and a belt snapped  Its been parked on the street every since  while we debated and procrastinated deciding its fate The night it was towed away  I still remember that the interior smelled fresh  the car glistened in the moonlight  and the tow driver was truly amazed we wanted him to tow this  quot new car quot  away  And  on the whole  it was a very good car  The 3 8L V 6 was very peppy  handling was secure for a wagon  and the climate control and trip computer were all somewhat ahead of their time  a bit too much  so it would appear  We also miss the cargo space tremendously  It was a good car  but it simply was not reliable br br
