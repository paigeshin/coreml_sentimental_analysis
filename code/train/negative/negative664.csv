 Summary   Ford Focus Wagon SE  aptly fills the void between gas guzzling Ford minivans and undersized hatchbacks b We bought this car because b We bought the  Ford Focus Wagon SE  because we had  Ford Dollars  that expired June  2000  The Ford Focus was really the only Ford that had come along in a long time that interested me  The previous Ford small car Wagon  the Ford Escort Wagon  was adequate  but I wanted more  I d rented a  Windstar  on a long vacation trip  and was impressed with the room and comfort  but highly unimpressed with the gas mileage  This was before gas prices went up 50  as well  For a daily driver  and a long commute car  I needed something small  but comfortable  I was also sold on the Wagon style  because I had such good experience with my 1990 Honda Wagon  We ordered anti lock brakes and the side impact air bag  as well  expensive options  but worth it   What I love b 1  Solid body structure  Almost like a Volkswagen  except with about 50 pounds less noise insulation  Also  unlike the Volkswagen Passat  the Focus has so far been extremely reliable  in the 40000 km I ve driven it  that works out to about 24 000 miles  2  There s enough trunk room for a large baby stroller and tons of groceries 3  There s plenty of headroom  You can wear a stetson or a foam Liberty tiara if you re heading off to a sporting event 4  The driver s seat goes up and down by turning a well placed dial under the seat  5  The radio is above the climate controls  and is easy to read  6  The steering wheel feels solid and thick 7  Handling and gas mileage are superb   What I hate b i 1  Shopping bag hooks i This is sort of a love hate feature  I love the shopping bag hooks for grocery bags on the walls of the rear cargo area  I hate the shopping bag hooks  because you almost have to cut the bags off to release them from the hooks  especially after a bumpy driveway ride has seated them more firmly on the hooks i 2  The cruise control i When engaged  the cruise control accelerates roughly 4 km h and then locks onto that speed  When you get used to it  you can actually use this to your advantage  but it does take some getting used to i 3  Turn signal colour  I don t especially like rear turn signals that are red  I prefer yellow  The Focus Wagon s are red  Que sera sera b What I m unsure about b i 1  Power i I m not sure I like the power of the car  It s relatively underpowered compared to my 1988 Toyota Camry  even though they have the same size engine  2 Litres  This is still the case  even after 40 000 km i 2  Odd humming i The front tires have developed an odd droning sound at 82 86 km per hour  and again just above 120 km h  Maybe the rotation at 25000 km will take care of that   Note  it has not taken care of it  Check back here when we replace the tires after a hundred thousand kilometres or so i 3  Fluid leak i There s a slight burning fluid smell when I do the usual sharp turns in our driveway  This has mostly subsided  although there is still the occasional scorched smell i 4  Coffee grinding i The anti lock brakes work  although it sounds like you re grinding coffee with your brakes when it does engage  Hey  anything that helps me stop in slippery weather is fine by me  I think I m leaning towards  liking  this feature   The Recall b i Part I  A lot of Ford Focuses were recalled a few months back  for three things    1 was interior trim corrections    2 was brake related  in that brakes would lock up and wheels fall off    3 was cruise control related  in that the throttle would jam open occasionally  Check with your dealer to see if your car is affected   Part II  Our car was the subject of a recall about 3 months ago  in February  to fix a possible safety failure in the rear seat hinge  If the back seat was folded down  and weight put on the forward part of the back seat  the hinge that holds the rear seat down might become disengaged  we ve never experienced this ourselves  When the rear seat is reclined again  and in the event of a crash  the rear seat might fly forward  The recall service called for is the replacement of the rear seat hinge  The repair takes about half an hour b What it s like to drive b No one will stop you on the street and ask you where you bought your car  It s not like you re driving a Ferrari  or one of those new swoopy Celicas  You re driving a Ford  It looks nice  Lots of people are going to drive them soon  Ford has always put a little extra effort into the styling of their station wagons  and I like it  The handling of the car is very forgiving  Take a turn too sharp  and you ll get plenty of warning before the car does something evil  Driving this car quickly  because of the high seating position  feels like you re going about 10 km h faster than you are  Adjust  Slow down  relax  Not a lot of tire noise coming from the wheels  except for the aforementioned droning at certain speeds  It handles bumps well  exhibits the typical wagon bounciness in the back end  a casualty of a flat loading floor  and corners well   You should buy this car if b    You want a practical car that carries a lot of stuff  but don t want to spend a lot of money on gas b You should not buy this car if b    you ve hit the mid life crisis  If that s the case  go for the sportier engine option    you ve always wanted to trick up your car with an exhaust the width of a beer can  I suppose it can be done  but why    you need a  lot  of space  a lot of the time  Buy a minivan b Conclusion b We re happy with our purchase  so far  I expect to put about 300 000 km  180 000 miles  on this car  so I ll give updates every once in a while   Service update March 26  2001  after 33 000 km  8 months of service i Sway bar bushings  We took the Focus Wagon into our dealer because of a vibration in the wheels at speeds exceeding 80 km h  Also  in between us making the appointment and taking it in  I noticed a rattling in the front of the car when going over bumpy roads  we have a lot in our area  The vibration was as a result of dirt and small pebbles that had built up on the rims of the wheels  I ll be washing off those with a hose in the future  and was easily fixed  The rattling noise was harder to diagnose  but eventually  we found that there was excessive play in the sway bar bushings  These bushings are plastic  and are not normally required to handle high loads  but in our country dirt roads  we occasionally hit a bump when the bushing is under load  The bushings were replaced under warranty  I ll be looking into getting an extended warranty  I think   Engine  performance  fuel economy  After 33 000 km  the engine is as tight as it was when delivered  There is no excessive noise coming from the engine bay  and acceleration is better than when first delivered  Fuel economy has improved  and we regularly get 450 km from a tank of gas  we could probably get more  but I get nervous when the gas gauge indicator gets below the E b Service update May 6th  I have started noticing a hesitation in the transmission  on startup  when shifting out of park and into drive  or after switching from reverse to forward  It feels like the transmission is slipping a bit  and then it catches  If this persists  I will bring it in for a checkup  Other than that  the car is chugging along well  Fuel economy slightly improved  I get about 500 km from a tank of gas  this may be consistent with warmer weather as well  however  There is a ticking noise under the hood at idle that I don t recall being there last year  I will keep an eye on it   Service update  February 28  2003  We re coming up on the 3 year mark for our wagon  and have weathered a few more glitches  but in general  I remain pretty pleased with the performance with the wagon  Turns out  I had a chance to own a second wagon  our Vanagon caught fire  and turned it down for a slightly older Taurus wagon  One of the deciding factors was the slightly out there green colour of the Focus Wagon I looked at  And of course  the desire for a bit of variety  In any case  here are the additional problems that have cropped up over the last few years b Rear door misalignment  We noticed that the driver s side rear quarter panel was experiencing some abrasion on the side in front of the rear tire  to the point where bare metal was showing  The dealer pointed out that it was likely due to the rear door being slightly out of alignment  I asked it that would be covered under warranty  we were over the 60 000 km mark at this point  technically out of warranty  and were told  No  They adjusted the door  and now it s difficult to close  sometimes requiring 3 slams to get it closed  But hey  there s no more abrasion of gravel on that side of the car except for b Paint chips missing from behind front wheel  I don t know if a particularly energetic touchless car wash  or our attempts to extricate ourselves from getting stuck in our driveway  or just poor paint quality is responsible  but the paint on the lower body panel directly behind the driver s front tire is chipping badly  I may invest in mudguards  after I get it repainted   Faulty fuel sending module causes stalls after sharp right turns  In a technical service bulletin read to me at the dealership  Ford says that some drivers of the Focus may encounter loss of power if  a  the car has less than half a tank of fuel b  the car has just finished a sharp sustained right turn  and or c  under sharp acceleration This has happened to us  The official explanation is that the fuel sending module has debris in it  My unofficial explanation is that there s a faulty part in there  and Ford should be offering to replace it  In my mind  it s a clear safety concern  and should be replaced under recall with no cost to us  the consumer  In waiting for this to happen  I make sure  as much as possible  that I take right turns slowly  accelerate smoothly  and keep the tank over the halfway mark   Major repairs to date    Some major brake work  at the 100 000 km mark required about  600 US in parts and labour    Replacement of 4 tires  This happened at just over 100 000 km  Not bad  I replaced them with cheapies that have given good service over the last 20 000 km  and that s it  other than oil changes  The ignition wires were inspected at the major tune up at 100 000 km  and found ok  so they were left in there  This winter has been especially cold  and the block heater s been used many times  successfully  The only drawback of this car in the winter is the lack of obvious towing hookup points for tractors to grab on to to get you out of ditches
