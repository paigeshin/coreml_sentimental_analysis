 I bought a 961 2 red mustang convertible  the car of my dreams  Of course I go for looks and not practicality  I did not research the car fully and I wish I did now  Where do I begin  To start after the first week of use I had to get the radiator fixed  I got a flat tire and the power steering was messed up  I have had various tune ups over the two years that I have had it  Recently  all of the oxygen sensors went at the same time  And my trip mileage counter and odometer are busted  They do not accurately measure the mileage  For example  a 80 mile round trip turned into a 5 mile excursion  I drove for 3 hours total and all it measured was 5 miles  And of course  my service rep thinks I am crazy  especially since I am a young woman  And  he tells me that to fix this problem will cost me alot  since it not covered by my warrenty  On top of this  I have leak from the engine  of what I do not know  and a leak when it rains from the top  I recently drove my car in a blizzard in Upstate NY  I can t tell you what a miserable experience I had  If you want a fun looking car then the Mustang is the way to go  but if you are looking for a practical car that is reliable I wouldn t suggest it
