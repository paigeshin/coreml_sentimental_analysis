 The Crown Victoria is a breed that s siblings are dying fast  The only major competetors in it s category is the Lincoln Town Car and the Ill fated Chevrolet Caprice Classic  It s twin the Mercury Gran Marquis shares many of the same characteristics as the crown vic  Acceleration is very sluggish for a car of it s heft  The underpowered v 6 whines when the gas pedal is pushed  Where it lack s in perofrmance it is justified by the comfort and roominess  All ergonomics are well placed and simple  This car is designed for the grandma that hates  quot All Those Gadgets quot  It s forward bench seat is comfortable and squishy  But firm enough to support your grandma s Aching Hips  If you are still in your prime years I would stay away from this car unless you like the bulky fleet car look
