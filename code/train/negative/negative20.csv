 We bought a 1994 van used in 1996  We fell in love with the beautiful conversion package  it was very unique  We received many  many complements and offers of purchase over the past few years  But our problems began within two weeks of purchase  The ABS system went out so we took it to be repaired and within the next two months it was out again  So to the shop it went  It was repaired again and lasted until the end of 1999  In 1999 the ABS system went  the rear end started going out  the air bag went out  and the transmission was slipping  This van was babied the whole time we had it  so we do not understand why all the problems  We knew people with older Ford vans who had 200 00 plus miles and not a bit of trouble  ours finally had hit 100 000 and was going out of commission  We have now traded our Ford for a Mercury Villager and absolutely love it  The Ford was nice for show  but that was about it  I will miss it  but now I don t have to fight the wind  put up with a slipping transmission  or worry about my airbags deploying when needed br br
