 Since 1997  when I bought my 97  Ford Taurus  I have gotten to know my auto repair man very well  I have spent more time waiting in his shop in the past few years than I have going out with my husband  This car not only has given me a ton of trouble  but it s always strange odd trouble  Car troubles that no one has ever heard about  Last year I had to replace the engine because I drove through a puddle  That s right  the engine  Sometimes when I step on the brakes the rear defrost goes on  Of course this is just the mild trouble other problems I ve had  include the interior lights never going out  causing the battery to die  Sometimes the alarm goes off  while I m driving  I truly believe I could make a horror movie comparable to the Amityville Horror house move about this car  My point is  save yourself trouble and hassle and RUN don t walk away from that Ford Dealership br br
