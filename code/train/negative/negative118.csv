 I drove this pathetic little car for a weekend as a rental in Detroit  As I pointed out in the review of Detroit  my arms were sore at the end of the weekend  I was in town for a wedding and got the cheapo Hertz special at Detroit Airport  I got myself an ugly gold Contour that I had to run out through the rain to get from the Hertz lot  Now  Detroit is a car city  right  Well  these are some of the worst  most beat up roads I have ever come across  And the fine wheels of the Contour were putting all those bumps directly to my arms  This thing felt like it was made of plastic  except for the seats which were way too soft  I am probably a little skewed because of the bad roads  but this car had little going for it  It had all the standard  boring features of a mid size American car  It had little gusto on the freeways  although I didn t get a chance to try it on any hills because there apparently aren t any in Detroit  The trunk was nice and big and the windshield wipers fine  The maneuverability was fine  if not well heeled  The sightlines were fine  I think that this car stood out most for what it didn t do  stand out  It was just another boring  bad  lifeless American car  And I know a lot about those  having grown up driving a Buick Regal and now the proud owner of a Mercury Sable  Pony up a little more and try something besides the safe and boring American car
