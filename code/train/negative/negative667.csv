 O K  let me tell you about this car and my experiences first of all it was a Ford Focus SE with the Zetec engine which is more peppy than the 2 0 and had an automatic transmission this car spent a good portion of it s life mingling with mechanics during the nine month s i owned it which made me a little jealous The car had squeaks in the suspension which made it seem like i was paying  370 a month for an old 70 s model vehicle the brakes squeaked door trim had to be replaced trunk locked in place and had to be broken into to fix it a recall for something in the rear wheel area drivers door not aligned properly and was rubbing the paint on the rear door radio would go up in volume when you put it into park and had to be re programed and last but not least me and my wife along with my three daughters were riding around one night when all of a sudden the transmission went crazy the car started trying to stall and lights were going off and on which turned out to be a connector to the computer coming loose due the fact a tab that held it in place was broken I became heart broken to realize that this car was in love with mechanics so much so that i did not get to drive it as much as they did the only FOCUS i really had was focusing on the eyes of a mechanic to tell him all the cars problems So with all this said i let the car go and bought me A v 6 convertible Mustang that was not in love with any mechanics whatsoever
