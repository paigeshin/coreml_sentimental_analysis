 I bought this vehicle used in 1995 because I was expecting our first child and the sports car just would not do any longer  This was not my first choice for a sports utility but at the time the price was right  we paid  12 000 00 and it only had 40 000 miles on it  It was driven by an older gentlemen who had kept it in excellent condition and had only used the 4 wheel drive in snow  It has the Eddie Bauer package  power windows and doors  rear window defrost  cruise control  and a tow package  I loved it at first  but then after only a year  I started having problems with it  The check engine light would come on but whenever I stopped it would go off again  It spent 3 weeks in the shop with no problems found  On my way home from the shop  wouldn t you know it  the light came on  only this time it never went off  The shop at our Ford dealer said it was just a sensor gave me the bill for  856 84 and left me there almost in tears  Two weeks later  we started the same process with the rear anti lock brake light  Three years later I am still driving with this light on as no one can figure out how to fix it  To make a long story short  we have  in 6 years  replaced the oil pump 5 times  the brakes I couldn t tell you how many times  and other items relating to the engine so many times that we finally had it rebuilt in 1999 and I am still having problems with it stalling all the time  It now has 152 000 miles on it  I love to drive this type of vehicle when it is running correctly  I can see where I am going  even in the pouring rain  I live out in the boondocks so I really need this type of vehicle to get in my driveway at times  I would recommend a sport utility in a heartbeat  just not this particular one  It has cost me almost twice what I paid for it in mechanical bills  There are parts on this vehicle oil pump  battery  water pump  fuel pump  that you can count on breaking within a certain number of miles  So whenever it gets close to the mileage on these parts  I just stay close to home  The wrecker service in this area is on speed dial on my cell phone br br
