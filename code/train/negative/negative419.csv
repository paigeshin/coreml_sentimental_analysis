 We took our 1997 Ford super cab truck in to be serviced as soon as we received the fuel line recall notice  The servicing Ford dealer inspected the fuel line and stated that the fuel line had passed inspection and did not need replacing  Evidently it is Ford s policy not to replace a defective part unless it is malfunctioning  We drove down to Florida about two months later and noticed poor gas mileage  When the truck was parked  we also noticed a strong gas odor  Upon examining the street under the truck  we saw gas dripping from our truck  We immediately called for an appointment to arrange for the problem to be repaired  which turned out to be the recalled fuel line unbeknown to us  The repair was made  but we were not informed that the problem was due to the safety recall  We were advised to take the problem to Ford directly  We wrote Ford and subsequently received a phone call from their customer relations center advising us that the part repaired WAS the safety recalled fuel line and to get in touch with the original dealer who made the inspection  That dealership is going to reimburse us for repairs  but we have other expenses we incurred due to the safety recall not being repaired when first inspected  We will have to go to Ford directly  again  for these additional expenses  The bottom line is that Ford should be more proactive in repairing all safety recalls whether or not they are malfunctioning at the time  As it stands now  it is our understanding from two dealerships that Ford repairs only malfunctioning parts in safety recalls  We might have been exposed to a fire or something worse had we not noticed the problem ourselves  This seems to be an ongoing problem with Ford Motor Company and we feel they need an attitude adjustment if they are going to stay in business
