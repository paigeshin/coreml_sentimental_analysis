 What I said then  I have always liked the looks of the Ford Contour  but I never seriously considered buying one When my wife and I decided to cut expenses  it was clear that the easiest way to do that would be to unload my beloved Ford Focus ZX3  check out my Focus reviews  After much wailing and gnashing of teeth  I set about looking at used sedans in the  8000 and under range I drove them all  Corsicas  Neons  Cavaliers  even an ancient Camry  Then I ran across a black   97 Contour GL with 67 000 miles at the local ford dealer s used lot  It had the best ride and  except for the 3 1L Corsicas  the most get up and go  The Contour is also the least boring to look at of any car on the list I had the car in the dealer s service department the first three days I owned it  Minor glitches that the dealer took care of at no charge for me  They replaced the rear suspension links  which were making a horrible thunking noise over bumps  the belt and idler pulley  and adjusted the driver s door to eliminate a bit of leakage around the seal  Since then  the car has been smooth running and trouble free Some of the interior bits are a little loose  but no more than I expect in a pre Focus Ford car  All of the options and gadgets work perfectly  The highway ride is glassy smooth and quiet  and power is typical of the Zetec engine If you keep it spinning in the mid range  3000 4500 rpm  the Contour is capable of surprisingly urgent acceleration On the downside  my Contour has a good deal of play in the drivetrain which makes smooth corner exits difficult  and standing starts take a bit of concentration to avoid chattering the too grabby clutch  I don t know if this is a typical Contour problem My biggest gripe with the interior is the retractable cupholder in the center console  It s flimsy and too small for anything but a soda can  Also  it s too close to the shifter and parking brake  I tugged the brake handle up with the cupholder open and lost some skin off of my knuckles In spite of my disappointment over giving up my Focus  the Contour has become an agreeable driving companion and I believe it will keep me happy until our finances stabilize and Ford brings the Focus ZX5 to the States Update January 2002  What I say now  The Contour started giving me trouble last August and hasn t stopped  Out of the blue  the engine began to die at random intervals while driving  No warning of any kind  it simply shut off  The dealer had the car for the better part of a month and couldn t figure it out  After a while  they just gave up and I have had to live with it Then the airbag light started flashing intermittently  So I traded the thing in on a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer  I m much happier now Review on the Lancer coming soon
