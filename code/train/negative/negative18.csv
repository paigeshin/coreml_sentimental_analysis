  drive these cars I don t care how many damn children you have  or how many boats you tow daily  this not a  necessary  car for ANYONE these trucks are eyesores and harmful to the environment  i m so far from an being eco terrorist  but these machines are inefficient  gas guzzlers that make the air nasty to breathe  bigger  better  deadlier  these are not SAFE cars  the momentum that a truck of this size has will give a whole new meaning to  whiplash  indeed these are long  too  long and tall  dangerous  because regular cars can t see the road ahead of them  and even worse that people have no idea how to HANDLE these things  why are these machines classified as class  B  vehicles  like yugos  volvos or fiats the only thing that makes me madder than the cars are the morons who feel the need to drive them  soccer moms have traded their piece of cak mini vans  which i m actually starting to MISS sharing the road with  compared to these suvs  explorer owners trade in for the expedition and the excursion  it s an endless cycle of mechanical penis envy  yuppie materialism  and blind faith in  SAFETY excuse me  i ve got to go  i ve got gastanks to urinate into   where s my stepladder
