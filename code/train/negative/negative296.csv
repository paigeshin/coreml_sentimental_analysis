 That is what I was told by a a Ford Motor Company engineer who I met with to discuss a vibration in the gas pedal at 2 250 RPM  since that time the vibration has gotten much worse  and at times the transmission hesitates shifting to the next highest gear  He also told me that his bosses 2000 Windstar had the same vibration  He stated to me that it was a  normal operating condition  to me it was not anything normal and I would not have purchased a 2000 Windstar if I would have noticed it during our test drive  The first time I noticed it was when we were driving 3 hours and I noticed it at highway speeds and my foot started falling to sleep  I questioned the engineer at the time if this was  normal  then why did Ford fix the problem in the 2001 models  He did not answer me  I did not have this vibration in my 1995 Windstar  why was it added in 2000 and removed in 2001  My concern is what does it mean  Could it be mismatched parts  incorrect tolerances  something wearing in the transmission    and will I have a problem after 36 000 miles are on the vehicle  Consumer Reports even suggests to stay away from several of the model year Windstars  including the 2000 model  additional note I talked to an ex engineer at Ford and he was not surprised what I was experiencing  because his parents complained about the same vibration in their 2000 Windstar  The questions to ask yourself is what did Ford change in newer models and why if in their words the issue in the 2000 model is a  normal operating condition
