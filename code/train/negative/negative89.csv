 My experience thus far with Ford and my Ford Explorer Sport has been subpar  Reviewing an automobile  I d like to take the more Consumer Reports approach  and just list the good things and the bad things I ve experienced since January 2000  Good  1  My dealer was fast  and gave us what we wanted quickly  2  We got a surprise delivery of two very nice  folding director s chairs with the  quot Ford Outfitters quot  logo that we use regularly  It was a nice touch  especially with them not even telling us about the gift  3  It s a comfortable car with effective air conditioning and practical seating  The fold down rear seats are a very smart design  Ok  the bad  1  It was a bit overpriced for what I got  I ve driven a Jeep Cherokee before this  with the old body style  and it was much cheaper and practical  2  The gas mileage is totally horrendous  I have yet to obtain the average mileage advertised on the window summary at the dealer  Very bad times to be driving gas guzzlers  Again  something the Cherokee was much more efficient in  3  Ford Credit has been very crooked  We specifically asked not to receive their special warranty  but the creditors charged us anyway  and when we asked for a refund  they simply applied the 1800 dollars toward the END of our loan  And they have not cooperated or tried to undo the situation since  So  we are in effect paying interest on an 1800 dollar warranty we asked not to have  That was a major downer  4  The stereo sucks  5  The suspension sucks  6  It s value has already depreciated significantly from the time of purchase  and we are already after 5 months well into negative equity It s my first Ford  And probably my last for a long time
