 The Ford Excursion is the largest sport utility vehicle on the market  I would only recommend this vehicle if you REALLY need to tow 11 000 pounds b EXTERIOR   Like some SUV s on the market  the Excursion is based on a pickup truck  In this case it s the Ford F 250  As far as styling goes  I would call it  functional  but nothing more b INTERIOR   The wide seats are very accommodating  Power adjustable pedals are a nice feature  but I m a rather tall driver and thus have no use for them  There is a lot of head and leg room all throughout the front and 2nd row seats  even for me  Although the Excursion is not very aerodynamic  I feel it does a good job of keeping wind noise down to a minimum  not like a Lexus though  My test car has the diesel engine  It idles pretty loudly  The optional Reverse Sensing System helps a lot because  usually  the bigger the car  err  SUV  the bigger the blind spots  To me  an SUV of this size should only be used for towing or hauling  However  luxury options such as leather upholstery  an entertainment system  a CD changer  and even automatic climate control is either standard or optional depending on the model b ENGINE   There are gasoline engines available  but gas mileage with those engines are horrible  The diesel engine is a little more thriftier  The 7 3 liter POWERSTROKE turbocharged V8 diesel engine produces 250 horsepower at 2 600 rpm  and a substantial 505 lb ft  of torque at an extremely low 1 600 rpm  This may sound like a lot of power  but in my opinion  the 7 250 pound SUV NEEDS that kind torque just get moving  This engine serves only 2 purposes  Towing  and fuel economy  The diesel is more expensive to buy than the gasoline engines so take it for a test drive before you decide to buy one  All engines use the same 4 speed automatic transmission  I averaged 17 7 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving b HANDLING   This is the Excursion s weakest point due to its size  It s very ponderous on twisty roads  and has a huge turning circle  Getting in and out of parking spaces is like a chore to me  I m surprised there is even a limo version of the Excursion  The brakes feel strong  but it takes a bit longer to stop from speed than other  lighter   I m talking 5 000 pounds  sport utility vehicles b RIDE   Small bumps are easily absorbed due to the 137 inch long wheelbase  Hitting larger bumps  to me  can get annoying at times  Despite being so large  the Excursion feels very stable in a straight line b RELIABILITY   Although nothing too serious has happened  for a while I was hearing a popping noise coming from under the floorboard  I have yet to figure out what it is  but I will update this review as soon as possible b VALUE   Despite its drawbacks  the Excursion is a fairly good value  assuming you need the towing capacity  or room for 9
