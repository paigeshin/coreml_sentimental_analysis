 If you love American vehicles  beware  I  personally  don t care for them  I find Japanese and German automobiles to have better service records  more style  and an overall better feel to them  When renting a car for the purpose of travel  however  an American car is most often the only option  So when I traveled to Connecticut for a week  I had a choice to rent a Ford Explorer or Taurus I chose the Taurus  I wish I had chosen the Explorer I disliked the car from the moment I sat down inside of it  The seats were so uncomfortable  To help illustrate how uncomfortable it was let me paint a picture  My cousin has an old sleeper sofa with flat  worn out cushions  To keep people from sinking to the floor when sitting on the sofa  she has a piece of ply board between the cushions  and you really feel like you are sitting on a piece of thinly padded ply board  That s what the seats in the Taurus felt like  I can t even imagine taking a long road trip in this car let me know when you plan to arrive  and I ll fly out and meet you  I also felt like I was sitting too high up for a sedan  and no matter how much adjusting I did to the seat  I just couldn t get comfortable  The ignition was hidden so far under the steering wheel that it required me to do a deep side stretch just to start the car  And the console controls  i e  radio  A C  defrost  etc  are so far away from the driver  that unless you have the wingspan of an albatross  some major leaning is involved just to find a good song on the radio Speaking of the radio  I had to turn it up really loud to drown out the loud interior noise  Acceleration sounded like the takeoff in an airplane  Now if someone would serve me a light snack and a beverage of my choice while driving to the grocery store I wouldn t mind it so much  but they don t  So I would rather do without so much noise And this tank of a car skids on the snow  Even with all weather snow tires  That was a major disappointment since I sprang for a larger car knowing that I would likely be driving in snowy conditions  The heater took forever to heat up  and the rear defrost took even longer The only positive thing was the roomy interior and trunk  If you plan on taking a driving vacation and want to bring a lot of people and luggage  this is the car for you  But keep in mind they will have plenty of elbow and leg room  It s just that their butts will be sore numb from the horribly uncomfortable seats  If after all of this you decide to buy one of these vehicles  I wish you all the luck in the world  That and a good seat cushion  You ll need both br br
