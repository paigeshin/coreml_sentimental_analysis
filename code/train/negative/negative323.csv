 We bought our 1999 Windstar LX used towards the end of my pregnancy with our third child  This is our first minivan   wanted to make sure it was well rated and safe  so we did a lot of checking around  The first 8 months went by without incident  but since then we have had nothing but problems  Ironically  it all started immediately following recall service  The first problem was a wiring issue  It had died on me on my way home   we had to have it towed  They found that there were wires that had apparently been cut under the dashboard  This was not covered  being that  we found out then  our warranty had expired not by mileage  but years we were told by the salesman we had 1 year   almost 18 000 miles left  As I was driving home from picking it up from that service  I noticed the check engine light was on  Upon checking my manual when returning home  it said to drive the vehicle through 3  cycles  before taking it for service  I did that   found out a week later that we had an oxygen sensor that needed to be replaced  Also  not covered  I did at least get them to take the diagnostic charge off  being that whoever test drove it after the service should have seen the check engine light  Anyway  moving on  next there was the idle problem I could start the car   it would run as long as I had my foot on the gas pedal  Apparently a valve was getting stuck open   had to be replaced  Immediately after this problem was fixed  I traveled to Georgia to visit friends    upon trying to return home my transmission went out  At 30 000 miles  Luckily  the only thing that happened is that the overdrive light started flashing after being on the highway for a few minutes    I returned to my friend s house  I have read about incidents where the van accelerates on its own  or takes off into reverse  2 weeks after trying to go home and a lot of stress  I made it home with my infant   2 sons just in time for school to start  I got the dealer to cover half of the costs  they have  hidden warranties  they don t tell you about called p05 and p07  but it was still  1200  Needless to say I will not only never buy another Ford  but I would strongly agree with others stating how awful Ford customer service is  Do a search on the internet about Windstars   you will find as much information on transmission   steering rack problems as you do for the Caravans  They say the customer service is supposed to be improving  but I don t believe selling cars that they know have problems is good customer service  This has been a KNOWN problem for years
