 Make it simple Strengths  Huge cargo area with the rear bench seats removed   great when we moved Cruise control has been great on long trips   gas mileage hovers around 18 mpg highway  Weaknesses  Transmission has been the biggest problem so far   I m not pleased at the way the resale value is plummeting just 18 months after purchase  Book value is half of what I paid for it just 18 months ago   with 83 000 miles it may be time to cut my losses and go for a Suburban  Also  I don t like the fact that there are no headrests on the rear bench seats  SInce my kids are small  I didn t pay attention to it until some adult friends came along for the ride  and now I m paranoid of serious whiplash injuries if we ever get rear ended  Overall  I m getting my money s worth out of this car  but it could have been worse  I bought it used with 45 000 miles on it and the dealer put in a new transmission less than a week after I drove it off the lot  Fortunately this dealer offers a three month warranty on any used car so it did not cost me  However  the new transmission failed within a month so they replaced two sensors and put in another transmission  again at no cost  So far so good a year and a half later  The only major repair after another 35 000 miles is the steering arm on the front passenger side  otherwise just routine maintenance  After reading other reviews I guess I can t complain yet  The dealer has made all the difference so far   they have treated me great  I was in a loaner car for several days while the transmission was being fixed   great service and great attitude from the service team so far  and it s been the only reason I have continued to own Ford products  I had an Escort station wagon and a Ranger 4x4 before this  but nothing compares to my  95 Mazda 626  which gave me a quarter million miles of virtually maintenance free service before giving up the ghost
