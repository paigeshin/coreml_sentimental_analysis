 I have had nothing but problems with my contour since I bought it  Within two weeks the cup holders broke  They are ade from flimsy plastic located in between the front seats  Next the driver s side head rest broke  280 to fix  So needles to say I don t have a headrest in my car that is functional Numerous factory recalls and  as Ford terms them  extended warranties  These include front strut springs  both of mine failed within a week of one another  Others include under hood wiring  Heater blower switch and heater fuse  These are just the ones that I have had problems with I recently found that this car has a 30  fail rate in transmissions above 75 000 miles  Are you kidding me almost 1 in every 3  I know because Ford uses a type CE4E transmission  that they have known is problematic since they started using it in 1994  If your transmission goes it ll run about  2000 to  3500 to fix  rebulid or replace My second issue is with Ford itself  I purchased my car and purchased the 100 000 mile power train warranty  It was 100 000 miles or 56 months  Get this my transmission failed 1 day after the warranty  56 Mos  was up My advice is if you own one  rid yourself of this car fast  If your going to buy one don t  And always ask a Ford dealership what kind of transmission is in the car  If they say CE4E  then laugh and walk away
