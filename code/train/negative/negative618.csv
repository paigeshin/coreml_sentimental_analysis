 I bought a 98 Ford Escort sedan brand new  It was a nice looking car  and was affordable for me  a divorced mother  It had all the important options available  had four doors  and was easy to handle on the road  I loved the Escort s appearance  the sound system  I had the Premium Sound option  and the comfort of the seats  I hated the leaky trunk  I took that car in every few months to have the trunk fixed  but still ended up with a moldy trunk  moldy stroller  and nowhere to put my groceries if I wanted them to stay dry  After eighteen months of repairing the trunk without positive outcome  I finally talked Ford into helping me into another car  They would only help me out of the still topsy turvy loan if I went into another Ford  I did so  but NOT an Escort again  I am too afraid that I ll end up with another unrepairable leaky trunk  That brings me to the biggest problem with Escorts  Anyone knowledgeable about the auto market will tell you that they do not hold their value well they are a dime a dozen  Driving my Escort never gave me too much trouble  even in snow  It was easy to steer  inexpensive to maintain  was good on gas  and still looked nice  Its the perfect car for anyone wanting a new  comfortable car for a decent price  Just watch the trunk br br
