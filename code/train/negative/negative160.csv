 We purchased a new Ford Taurus in 1996  In the first 3 year we owned the car it was to the dealer several times for minor repairs  The speedometer malfunctioned and had to be replaced and the alternator went out The major problems began after the car was out of warranty and had close to 60 000 miles on it The rear engine mounts were the first to go with repair costs being close to  800 00  Then once again the speedometer had to be replaced at a cost of approx   200 00  Over Thanksgiving weekend 1999 the fan that cools the motor went out It was taken to the Ford dealer for repairs at a cost of  200 00 When the car was returned to us with the new fan we noticed our heater was no longer working  It was taken back to the Ford dealer and low and behold it had a blown head gasket 1000 00  The car is once again returned to us  The very first time I drive it the check engine light comes on and I smell radiator fluid  The car goes back to the dealer and this time has a split radiator with the cost being  200 00  I am almost scared to drive it now  I really like this car due to the fact that it has a great safety rating and it is a very comfortable car to drive and ride in  However I would recommend that you trade it in before it goes out of warranty br br
