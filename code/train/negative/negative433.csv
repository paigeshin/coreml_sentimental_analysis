 Considering a new 2000 Ford Mustang GT  Think twice  In fact  don t think about it at all  I m on my fourth late model Mustang and definitely my last  The quality of the vehicles has gone down hill over the past two years and Fords service and support structure is even worse The car has been in the shop constantly since I purchased the car new late last year  It still has unresolved problems that both the dealers and Ford are unable to diagnose and fix  I ve communicated with several other 2000 Mustang GT owners with similar problems ruling out the possibility that my Mustang is anomaly The car has excellent power for the price paid  is fun to drive and looks good with the top down  Handling is good once the stock tires are replaced with a set of real performance tires  However  the rigidity of the car is marginal  Several rattles and squeaks are present and one might think the car was going to  quot fall apart quot  over rough roads The key statement here is  quot for the price paid quot  If you can t afford a real performance car and are willing to put up with marginal quality and poor service  then this is the right car  Just be sure to sell it before the warranty expires br br
