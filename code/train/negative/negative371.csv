 There s good news and bad news  First with the good news  I ve managed to squeeze out 165 000 miles from this truck and she s still running  That s more than a lot of other people can say for their vehicles  On that point I am  indeed  satisfied The bad news I ve also had quite a few problems along the way  I ll start by saying that I would be cautious about buying one of these trucks used  During my first 36 000 miles I had to have a couple of repairs done to the front axle  From about miles through 40 000   100 000 I had random problems with the electrical system that caused it to not start  I don t mind paying to get a vehicle fixed  but I absolutely can t stand being stranded by my vehicle  At 96 000 miles the manual transmission went out and that had to be replaced with a rebuilt one  This was a nightmare in and of itself  but that s another story all together  This cost about  1800 to get fixed  Luckily it was covered under an extended warranty through my insurance company that was about to expire at 100 000 miles  At about 130 000 miles the 4x4 went bad so I can t use that anymore  Around 115 000 miles the air conditioner went bad  Not knowing how much further this vehicle would last I decided not to get the  1000 dollar repair  Had I not had those previous problems  I probably would have pitched in the  1000 dollars to get the AC fixed  Oh well  hindsight is 20 20  These are the major problems that I ve had  Along the way a number of other issues have popped up as well  There was a recall on the emergency brake and there was also a recall on the rear window  Additionally it seems like the plastics on the inside are really flimsy  The handle to my driver side door snapped off at about 90 000 miles and the dashboard vents to the AC have broken so that you can t adjust the direction of the airflow  The armrest that sits between the passenger and driver has even broken off  So now I just lay the arm rest where it was once secured in place  Oh yes  the tape deck has always been screwy  sometimes eating my tapes  ever since about 20 000 miles on  I don t even bother with it anymore  All in all  I m glad to say that I was able to squeeze out 165 000 miles from this  and believe it or not my last 30 000 miles have been less troublesome than my first 30 000 miles  Even with soooo many miles  I m hesitant to try another one of these again considering the problems it s had  Since it did actually get me 165 000 miles I m giving this a 3 and not a lower score  Good luck br br
