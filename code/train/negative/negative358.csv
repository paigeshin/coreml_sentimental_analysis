 Sorry  Ford lovers  maybe Ford was good in the 70 s but now they have really lost it on quality  Nice looking truck  maybe  but when will you get to drive it when it s always in the shop  Ok here s the story  A relative ordered a 1999 Ford Ranger XLT4WD  loaded  She was so excited and she had been a faithful Ford buyer for 40 years  She waited and waited and waited finally after many delays it comes in and yes  it s a nice looking truck  It has lots of features BUT after a couple of weeks  it s in the shop for one thing or another  She gets it out and then something else goes wrong  This goes on for months thank goodness she has more than one vehicle or she would be in bad shape   You can t always get a loaner  Engine problems  wiring problems  plastic parts break off in cab  Seat adjusters won t work  Ok  so you say  you didn t actually OWN this truck  You are right  but this is not the first Ford Ranger she has had and after awhile they start falling apart  I was a witness to this  I know that they are rated highly  but please investigate before you purchase  that is a lot of money to spend to have it in the repair shop all the time UPDATE 11 8 00 I have been getting a lot of feedback on this rating  but I stick to my original opinion  This truck MAY have been a lemon  but keep this is mind  within the first year the engine had to be replaced  wiring worked on  a c repaired door lock replaced  twice  and other miscellaneous repairs  Be advised that she did buy the extended warranty and is very glad that she did  She will Not be buying another Ford truck in the future  She continues to have problems and this not even to mention the Firestone tires that had to be replaced  Sorry again Ford Lovers Another UPDATE  7 01 Ignition had to be replaced Wind blows through the truck like a window is slightly cracked  but you can t seem to find out where the air leak is   A loud whistling noise  Also  the tailgate is hard to latch  it doesn t seem to fit well I ve stated before that I am not the owner  Thank heavens  so I don t have to worry about the expenses  but whenever I drive the vehicle  it drives fine Without knowing the history of this vehicle  I would assume that it was great  so please ask questions if you consider buying one  And just to let you know  I have owned several Fords in the past  both cars and trucks  and were happy with them  Those were the good ole days  Buyer beware it ain t like it used to be
