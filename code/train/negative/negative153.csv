 I bought my 2001 Cobra in January 2003  I missed the power after selling my modified 1991 Mustang GT a couple of years ago  My Cobra had 13 000 miles on it  so  it was practically new  I was impressed with the power of the Cobra and the brakes  However  I had problems with my Cobra  There was what some call  driveline slop  when shifting  There would always be a loud clunking noise coming from the rear of the car  Eventually  there was a big  bang  one day and it turns out my rear differential failed  There were problems with the warranty repair but that s another story  See note at end  After getting the car back it drove better   Driveline slop  was gone  I was happy until a month later  when the rear axle bearings went out and needed to be towed back home  The car has left me stranded twice and it only now has 27 000 miles on it  The axle was repaired under warranty and now I will sell the car as soon as possible  I will not keep this car past the warranty period There are other things I should mention like the drivers s seat shifting during some cornering and the front bumper is loose  You can move it up and down with your hands  The Ford dealership says this is  normal  I don t think so The overall quality of the interior is kind of cheap looking with lot s of plastic  The shifter console is loose around the shifter  Just overall low quality  Looks like Ford just built a piece of crap car around a good engine and brakes  Note to anyone considering buying a used car from a Ford dealership  If the car is still under mfgr s warranty  have the dealership print you out a copy of the vehicle s  OASIS  report  That s the Ford vehicle info database  It shows all repairs done at Ford dealerships and it shows the vehicles warranty status  This could become important later
