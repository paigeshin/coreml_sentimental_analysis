 Well where to begin  I purchased the 95 Ford Aspire in 1999  It was a great deal I paid 4000 bucks for it and it only had 24 000 miles on it  It was my first car so of course I was in love with it That changed as the years went by First of all  the Ford Aspire is one of the Ugliest cars you will ever see  It got to the point that I was embarrassed driving it  Don t even try to put a spoiler on it that makes it worse  Also my car was red when I bought it and orange 4 years later even with a fresh wax job it still looked orange  That s the outside of the car  The inside isn t much better  The fabric they used to make the seats was ripping when I purchased it if that tells you anything  WOW  and it was so ugly  So if you like getting teased for the appearance of your car this is the car for you  My dad thought it would work well for either a go cart or a golf cart  and one time when the aspire was broken down  my father thought he could just go pick it up and put it in his trunk instead of spending the money to have it towed Another downfall was the fact that the car didn t come equipped with ANYTHING well  except wheels  The 95 Aspire does not have Power Steering  This is horrible especially if you are used to having it  I eventually got sort of used to it as my arm muscle started getting stronger  Parking is almost impossible in tight spots unless you are HEE MAN  The 95 Aspire also does not have rear defrost this is nasty especially if you live in Minnesota like I did  I felt like I was scrapping the inside of my windows more than the outside  Some other features that the 95 aspire does NOT have are cd tape player  cruise  and air conditioning As my car started getting older I felt like there was always something wrong with it  I think I had oil leaks about 50 times  the brakes had to be fixed often  and the saddest of all was the time I hit a pot hole and the front wheel axle literally broke in half  I put more money into the car than I paid for it originally So needless to say  when I got in an accident with it 7 months ago  I was relieved to see it totaled  How embarrassing to get in an accident and have little orange pieces of plastic scattered around not to mention the styrofoam that was revealed underneath  R I P  Ford Aspire
