 My mom had a 1986 Ford Taurus  I belive it was the first year of of cars  We were lucky to get the worst car ever  a 4 cyl  taurus  So depressing  My mom bought this car in 1994 after her last car was stolen  Ohhh i remember going with her to pick it up  It looked nice in the garage it was in  really it did  My mom started it and we were on our way  It felt like we were riding in an enclosed lawnmower  That is what it felt and sounded like  The way it sounded was the very least that was wrong with the car  In time the drivers side window became a problem  It was fine to open  but when it came time to close  the window went out instead of up  real nice for protection huh  The car wasnt very mechanically well built either  I was lucky enough to be driving the car when its transmission droppd dead  Thats right folks  pouring rain  up a hill  in the worst area of NYC and lots of traffic  I wasnt too happy  and niether was the 20 cars behind me  Someone did help me push the car though  So after the transmission was fixed it worked  sort of  A few monthes later the car went on fire  now that i think about it   it was taken to the mechanic at least once a week because the engine was smoking  severly overheating  Did i metion we kept water in the car incase the car went on fire  Oh yea  another thing  the hood couldnt stay up by itself  he held it open with a hockey stick  oh yea and another thing about opening the hood  well the thing u pulled back on to make the hood release broke off  so we had to pull the wires with a vice grip  The windsheild washer pump never worked  and winshield wipers didnt work either  OK OK  and the rear bumber was falling off since the day we got the car  Needless to say the tranmission died again  and my mom gave to car away  All these things happned within 7500miles of eachother when we got the car it had 49 000 miles  piece of junk no br br
