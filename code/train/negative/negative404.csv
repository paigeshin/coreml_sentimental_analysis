 I purchased an 89 Ford Taurus new because I fell for the hype  quot Best selling car in American quot  THAT DOESN T MEAN A THING except a lot of people were deceived by the numbers  I ve had expensive repairs all along and visited web sites that say Ford knew of the bad transmission  just spent  3 000 for a rebuilt one 6 months ago  when they were building the car  They even have a site with a lawyer suing the company  There are many  many people like me  Now I am faced with another  1 700 to fix the head gasket valve and engine mounts  I want another car but can only spend  8 000 for a used car  Don t talk yourself into a car before you do your homework and be practical about the car br br
