 I got my new  blue  Y2K Taurus only 10 short days ago  My previous vehicle was a red 98 Taurus with which I was delighted  Now  I am NOT delighted  While traveling at the speed limit of 70mph  on the interstate in my new vehicle  cruise control on for ticket prevention  I felt a strong JOLT and looked in my rear view mirror because I thought I must have run over something  There was no dead animal  ladder  or D O T  worker lying in my wake  My car was rapidly losing speed  and I turned on the emergency flashers as I made my way to the side of the road  There was sudden apparence that my NEW 10 DAY OLD Taurus had decided to chew its transmission into powder  and refuse to move  Ford roadside assistance was very nice  and the tow truck arrived after dark  The mortally wounded bull was towed to a dealership other than the one where it was born  The surrogate dealership was NOT excited to see the tag of the other dealer still on the back of the vehicle  To say they were less than kind would be an understatement  The made it clear  up front  they would get right to work  in three or four days  if they had time  The new Taurus is a louder ride  with stiffer seats  and in my case  a very unsatisfactory transmission  and that s NO BULL
