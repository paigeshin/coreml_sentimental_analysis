 I am a cautious driver  with fairly decent maintenance record  The truck is a fairly nice truck by looks and comfort  I got what I paid for    12 000  But  I am not impressed by the manufacturing and engineering of this 99 Ford Ranger  I wish Ford would try to ensure quality in the mechanical and electrical parts of the vehicle  That is  after all  what drives the trucks  not the cushion seats and the pretty red finish  although those are nice ABS  ODOMETER  SPEEDOMETER do not work  no recall for my particular vin   Multi function switch does not work properly  wipers go wild  and no recall for my particular vin   Tierod recently went out  Upper brake lights continually go out  Insistent pinging while using low mid grade gas  must use premium disgusted by the lack of recall of defective parts  not very thorough in their recalls Would I buy again  only if they improve their quality standards and maintaining a good service record with owners  I e  being honest to repair defective parts fs
