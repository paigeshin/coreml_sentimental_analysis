 I owned a 1996 Thunderbird LX v6 for 8 months and here s my first impression  fun for the city  smooth on the highway  but I m not sad I sold it The engine is a low horsepower high torque v6  3 8 liters with only 145hp  It does have 220 ft lbs of torque  so it pushes you back in your seat leaping from stoplight to stoplight  Get it on the freeway and this big v6 can hardly hit 100  I would say acceleration is good up to 55  then it tapers off The build quality inside was decent very plastic looking effects and velour everywhere  It did prove very durable and quite comfortable  The seats were like Barcaloungers soft and squishy  They didn t promote great posture and after long trips it made my back a bit sore The trunk was voluminous  but backseat space was pretty small  Front seat room was huge  lots of room over my head The Automatic transmission was one of the better ones I ve driven  always shifting at about the right spot  Occasionally on the highway it would disengage gears and rev the motor while trying to kick down for passing speed  which was a little un nerving The stereo was horrid but very easy to replace  including the awful little speakers  This was probably the most important money I put in the car The only repair I had was when the torque converter acted up and made the car shake in 3rd and 4th gear  Turns out the fluid used by Ford was less than optimal and a change to synthetic fixed the problem  as recommended by Ford Motor Company The car did not have anti lock brakes  an airbag  or a limited slip differential  all of which were promised by the salesman  Don t go to a Ford dealer I would rate the mechanical quality of the car at good  the interior at average  I sold the car and bought an Audi Coupe Quattro  the ownership of which I have not regretted for a moment  I will rate it  not recommended  just because I wouldn t go out of my way to drive one again it was good but there are better out there
