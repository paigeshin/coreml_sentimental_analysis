 We bought the Focus ZTS sedan because my wife needed an economical car to haul the grandkids around with  We traded in a  94 Explorer with a 5 speed just before the Firestone tire fiasco became public My wife loves driving the car  Although it is a bit small for me  6 1 quot    290lbs  it is OK  The car handles great  and with the Zetec engine  it has adequate performance  although I wouldn t want any less  quot go quot  than it s got Now for the problems   the main one of which is because I do my own oil changes  A particular sore point for me with most cars is that the manufacturers don t make it easy to change the oil and filter without creating a mess  This new Focus is particularly bad First  the owners manual indicates a Motocraft FL2005 filter  The car had an FL801 on it  which some ham fisted factory idiot had torqued to about a million foot pounds  I had to use some very large pliers and turn the filter almost 3 4 turn before it was loose enough to move by hand  Poor quality control The filter happens to be mounted in a horizontal position and is almost flush with the side of the engine  When I finally got it loose  oil ran down the side of the engine  onto the drive axle  onto the frame  down my arm  and all over the driveway  Very bad design  On other cars  I have been able to use a cut off soda bottle placed over the filter to catch the drips  On the Focus   it won t work The hood on this car is aluminum  It bends very easy   mine already has a dent in it   and I didn t have an accident  A minor problem is the power windows  They won t operate with the key in the accessory position  Tilt wheel also difficult to operate Bottom line   only 3 000 miles on this car  but it s going to get traded off as soon as possible for a vehicle with a little more  quot substance quot  and which is easier to maintain  I ve owned 9 Fords since 1986   still have 3  If all the newer Fords are made this way  the Focus may be the last Ford product I buy br br
