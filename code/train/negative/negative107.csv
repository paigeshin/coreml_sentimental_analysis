 First  I would like to state that I did not choose to buy my 92  Ford Explorer  My parents bought this sports utility vehicle for me on my sixteenth birthday  With out any knowledge of this vehicle  they bought it blindly from an auction no less  one thing that you should never do  As I was looking up good and bad trucks to buy from consumer reports  it states that this years ford explorer was a bad choice to buy because it has many problems  I absolutely hate this vehicle for the fact that every time I would like to go somewhere  something goes wrong with it  Every 1000 miles  I have to fill the oil up one quart  and it is such a pain to deal with  Then another thing that goes wrong with this car is that the windows  or electrical problems have started to arise  If you have ever rode a horse  it is the same feeling as riding in this truck  Anyone who wants to buy this vehicle  would be a fool br br
