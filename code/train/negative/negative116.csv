 I have purchased 2 Ford Contours in the past 2 years  My reasoning for buying a Contour was the price  I felt I was getting a pretty nice  roomy  some what sporty car for the money  I needed a family car but did nt want a van or SUV  With my first Contour I had very few problems besides the few recalls  In August of 98 our Contour was in a accident  It had flipped hitting numerous trees before coming to a stop  Yes i was very surprised to hear that a Contour could be flipped by being ran off the road  But that still didnt bother us we decided to buy another Contour in Sept  98  From September to December of 99 we received 7 recalls  We returned 3 times for the same recall  We had NUMEROUS problems with our new car  Yet we still had faith in our car  Until just last week  Our car was in another accident  trying to avoid a deer our car swerved as we tried to regain control of the car it also flipped  In neither of our accidents did our air bags go off  But yet they were both considered TOTALED  I ask how can a semi family car have been so easily turned over not once but twice
