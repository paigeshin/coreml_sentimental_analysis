 We bought our 1994 Taurus in 1999 when it had 52k mi on it  The car was in pretty good shape  I traded it in today at 72k mi  In the one years time and 20k mi we have had the car I have had to replace the water pump  serpintine belt  thermostat  brake pads  rotors  brake lines and other various suspension parts I traded the car because it needed another  3000 worth of work  The AX4N transmission had justed started to slip   requiring a rebiuld to fix  The rear calipers froze and needed replacing  Since the calipers froze it ruined the rotors so they also need replaced  The front struts and c v joints are shot and need replaced  I also needed to have the engine looked at as the transmission shop informed me that it was giving some engine error codes also The car was a roomy and okay to drive  can t handle corners too well  I hardly can believe that quality is job 1 at Ford br br
