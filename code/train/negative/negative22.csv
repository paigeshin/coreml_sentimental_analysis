 For generations the men in my family have insisted on purchasing Ford trucks  and usually buy the F 150 series  Sometimes the trucks where loaded with extras  but most of the time they bought just a plain unusual pickup truck with standard transmission  power brakes and power steering  and what they thought to be  a good solid engine and transmission True enough  when first purchased  these trucks looked great and were great to drive  The exterior was flawless  shiny  eye appealing  and had lots of showoff value  The performance during the first year of use was near perfect  And  of course  the owner was very proud to show off that new truck to his fellow hunters  fishermen  farmers  and offered everyone and their brother free rides But now  time has passed  and several years down the road and  lt 100 000 miles later  their tune has changed drastically  All the trucks have lost their luster  the paint is peeling off  numerous rust spots all over the cabs  roofs  and around the wheel covers  and the owners are frustrated and certainly don t have the money to have a new paint job  The standard transmissions all are failing miserably and the truck is often in the shop being repaired  The universal joints are going out  wrecking havoc in the life of the offshore worker who must be at work on time or face loosing a week s paycheck  But the most common problem that has appeared in EVERY Ford truck that they have own is the sudden stalling out in traffic  Push the gas pedal and the truck just stalls out and dies  rather than go forward  The trucks can NEVER be trusted to go into first gear and leap forward with any amount of speed safely My advice is to talk with long time Ford truck owners and way the pros and cons heavily before buying a truck that you expect to perform for many years to come br br
