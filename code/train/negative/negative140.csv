 I bought this vehicle because it is a sharp looking truck  There  I have said something positive about it  Now  let s get to the real important info  The brakes on this truck are a joke  It has been in the shop 7 times for brake problems ranging from flat out brake loss to a leaky master cylinder to the brakes locking up and or failing in the rain  The stereo is excellent  however the speakers fail to deliver more than an annoying staticky rattle  The air conditioning won t allow you to adjust the temperature on MAX AC to anything but arctic  The power steering pump whines and moans  The power windows jump down in intervals instead of smoothly rolling down  The ride is stiff and bouncy  The transmission takes it sweet time going through the gears and sometimes missing one or two along the way Whether or not I make it to the end of the lease in this vehicle remains to be seen  Having paid almost  19K for it a year ago and having it only worth  11 9K in trade now with only 13 000 miles is disheartening  Do yourself a favor BUY SOMETHING ELSE br br
