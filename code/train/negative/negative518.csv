 My 1995 Ford Taurus with a 3 8 liter V6 was recalled for a head gasket replacement  There was not charge for the replacement  however a week later the timing gear cover gasket failed  requiring replacement of both the gasket and cover  a  726 repair  This repair was out of my pocket because that gasket wasn t recalled  even though the cause of the failure was similar to the problems with the head gasket  If you are considering buying a used Taurus  or Windstar  with a 3 8 L engine you may want to find out if the timing gear cover gasket has already been changed  Ford has issued a service bulletin on this gasket however I have been unsuccessful in trying to get a dealer to show me the actual bulletin  Other than this gasket failure  air conditioner problem  twice  and a window seal problem  the car has been trouble free br br
