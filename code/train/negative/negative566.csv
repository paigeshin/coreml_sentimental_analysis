 I purchased a 1995 Ford Contour in August  1997  The car had terrific handling and decent performance from the 2 0 liter 4 banger  For the first 6 months I thought I made a wise decision  First it was the little things both spring activated cupholders broke  No biggie  but not covered under the extended warranty I passed on the service departments offer to replace them for  177  From there it was all downhill the blower motor for the heater stopped working  2 months later I was getting awful clunking groaning noises in the front end  only to find my stabilizer bars and stabilizer links were shot  Wouldn t you know that stabilizer bars ARE covered by the Ford extended warranty  but stabilizer links ARE NOT  To make a long story short during 1998 and early 1999 I was at my dealer 4 times for suspension related problems  and 2 times each for tie rods and front wheel bearings  With my  100 deductible for each visit  plus costs for non covered items  this car was killing me financially The last straw came in May  1999  At 64K miles  exactly 1000 miles after the extended warranty expired  the transmission dropped  I don t care what car you drive  but NO CAR should need a new rebuilt transmission at 4 years 65K miles  My local Ford zone office manager refused to look at the car  and further refused to offer any financial help  He flat out told me the only way they would help me is if a court told them to  Imagine that  Great customer service  huh  I needed to fix the car  but I wasn t going to let Ford touch it  Instead I took the car to an independent transmission shop  FIVE weeks and  1800 later my car was back  Why so long  Turns out it s nearly impossible to get the transmission parts  because everything was on national backorder  Plus my transmission guy informed me this was a  throwaway design  and by far the most difficult transmission job he s done  He said he ll probably never do another Contour Mystique transmission again  and if he did it would probably cost nearly double what he charged me  After arming myself with a written statement from him  as well as finding dozens of owner complaints online pertaining to the transmission  I took another shot at Ford and threatened to litigate through my state s Attorney General s office  Needless to say  Ford would up settling with me nearly 3 months later for  1000  which was better than nothing  By August 1999 I was totally fed up with this pile of rubbish and I traded it in for a 1998 Lumina  which turned out to be a very smart move  And it s not just the  95 s  or the 4 cylinder automatics my cousin owns a 2000 Contour V6 5 speed which has been a disaster from day one  specifically an oil leak that Ford can t seem to fix  As of July  2001  he s in the process of getting Ford to buy the car back under my state s lemon law  To any potential buyer  you would be well advised to shop elsewhere  My advice to current owners  If you have had premature automatic transmission failure and have had to shell out a bunch of money  let Ford know about it  There s no way you should get stuck for expensive transmission work on a throwaway transmission  Ford would never admit it  but I m sure they know this car has been and will be a disaster for them
