 I am not a car expert  but I know I waited many years before acquiring what I thought was my dream car  In January  2000  I bought a 1998 Mustang convertible 6 cylinder automatic  No doubt  this pony was beautiful to look at with its bright Atlantic blue paint and white top  But in the department of performance  the car was lacking  Many Mustang fanatics told me I got what I paid for as they swear by the GT engine  I was disappointed especially after driving three rental cars after the Mustang was rear ended and in the shop for repairs  All three of the rentals were equipped with 6 cylinder engines and all out performed the Mustang 6 cylinder   Rentals were a 99 Chrysler Sebring  a 99 Dodge Intrepid  and a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am  I just expected more from the Mustang than Ford delivered I understand Ford has improved the performance of the 99  6 cylinder Mustangs  but I am waiting delivery on a 2000 Mustang GT convertible  Now I will sit back and let the Mustang fanatice criticize me for choosing an automatic 8 cylinder over the standard transmission   br br
