 My 1992 Ford Taurus has 85 000 miles on it and is ready for the junk heap  It is just not a well built car  I purchased it in 1995 for  5 500  and at the time it had only 15 000 miles on it  no the odometer had not been turned back  Since then I have put untold amounts of money into this lemon and it is  nevertheless  on its last legs The radiator has been replaced twice as have the cooling fan and hoses  The brakes have been replaced twice in there entirety because Ford brakes do not have the tell tale squeal feature to inform one that the pads are becoming thin  Thus  you find out they are bad when you start to hear metal grinding at which time you realize you are about to owe an extra  200  Just this year I blew both heads on the engine  needed a new battery  new engine mount  new sway bars  new struts  for the second time  new battery cables  new calipers  another new coolant fan  had to have my electric window fixed on driver s side when it froze and my transmission is shot but I haven t taken care of that yet  The only thing on this car that has been reliable is the body which has not rusted at all  and I live in NY with harsh winters and salt on the road  Why do I still own this car  Well I am lazy  I don t know about you but shopping for a new car is something I look forward to with the same zeal as root canal  It also is a process that requires many hours of time which I frankly do not have Now you may be thinking that with all this repair I must have been very hard on the car  Actually no  I garage the car usually  have relatively frequent oil changes and tune ups  and I don t drive like a maniac  The car is either built poorly  or has gremlins The 1992 Ford Taurus has sluggish pep  and corners like a rhinoceros  There is also an annoying momentary hesitation when the gas pedal is pushed down  The brakes work fine between fixings and the car does have relatively ample trunk space  but the Ford s cupholder is located directly below the radio so it is very hard to drink anything and change stations  Also  the cupholder is incredibly poorly made  It has a thin hinged bar underneath that looks something like a  quot U quot  When you hit a bump that U sways forward  If you hit a few bumps it sways enough that it comes out from beneath the cup bottle and you have drink all over your legs  floor  seat and  in my case  my passport which is now partially stained purple and redolent of grape soda  Another thing I find annoying  this is really a tangent as most cars have this feature  is that when you touch the electric window button the windows rolls down all the way automatically  Whoever thought this up must not ever crack their windows which is the preferred degree I want them open  So what are the advantages of owning this car  Well  as I m sure you are all aware  the Ford Taurus is one of the sleekest cars on the road with its sexy boxiness and sultry lack of curves  I find women often turn there head as I drive by  whistle and say  quot nice Taurus quot   lt Yeah right  There are no advantages to having this car that I can discern I would say  all in all  stay far  far away from this automobile br br
