 This car was awarded European Car of the Year and the North American Car of the Year  I was so impressed by these accolades and the positive magazine reviews that I purchased a silver ZX3 in May  2001  It only took a few months for it to be transformed into lemonade My family and friends warned me and I didn t listen  After owning 6 European cars in 10 years  I did something I vowed to never do  purchase an American car  Problems occurred with my vehicle within the first month  A loud creaking sound was evident from the rear of the car when turning corners  After a few unsuccessful attempts of the dealership trying to fix this  one of Ford s engineers from Detroit was flown in  Spot welds in the rear chassis were drilled out and replaced with rivets  This DID NOT fix the problem  Since nearly the entire interior was disassembled to resolve the creaking problem  more squeaks and rattles were now present from the plastic trim panels coming apart There were a few driveability concerns with the car that were also not resolved  The car died while driving 4 times and often felt like it was going to die when approaching a stop light  The gearshift lever  manual transmission  would often stick and not go into 4th gear  On cold winter mornings  2nd and 4th gears had to be bypassed for the first few minutes of driving because the lever would not go into the gears  The dealership could not find any problem The car is rated 25 City  33 Highway miles gallon and I never saw anything close to this  I drove 60 70 on the interstate daily and never averaged more than 24 mpg  The dealer said this was normal All in all  my Focus ZX3 was at the dealer 6 times in the first 6 months of ownership for a whopping total of 43 business days  I contacted Ford s Dispute Settlement Board and asked them to repurchase my vehicle under the Lemon Law  They reviewed my case and a few months later Ford offered to replace my car with a brand new Focus or apply my money spent toward any new Ford product  I stood my ground and told them I would never buy another Ford and wanted my money back  My case was heard before the board and I won  Weeks later  a check was cut and I was refunded full purchase price including tax  title  and license  Based upon my experiences and a few of my friends that own Focuses  I try to sway everyone I know away from a the car  The initial price of the Focus is low  but so is the quality  If you really need a NEW car and don t have much to spend  you d be better off with a Hyundai  But better yet  purchase a 1 2 3 year old Honda or Toyota and have a great car without the headaches of a Focus
