 My parents bought this car when i was elementary school and I loved it  For a family car  this had enough room to keep my parents from constantly telling my sister and me to stop arguing about space issues in the back seat  But things began to take a turn for the worst about two years after the purchase of the car used  it then being around 2 or 3 years old  About 5 years ago  my family was riding home in it and the air conditioning just went out like that  No warning  just stopped  My family did not have a lot of money to just dish out around 1500 dollars for another air conditioner  and I found out later that this is a problem with many Ford vehicles until the mid 1990 s  So if you do purchase a Ford vehicle before 1994  make sure that the air conditioner is working or is new  because if it isn t new  9 times out of 10  isn t operational  I began driving the car two years ago as a junior in high school  Living in Texas and not having air conditioning is a scary situation and led me to almost pass out on one ride home  But there are other problems with the car I would just like to emphasize My sister has the car now and the last time I talked with my father he said that the transmission is about to go and for a 1990 model  it only has 100 000 miles on it  During the time I drove it  it broke down on me three times  Two of the times it was the water pump busting  The third time it broke down on me  it had something to do with my air conditioner  indirectly  Apparently when your compressor goes  that is what happened to the air conditioning  it is directly linked to the starter in a Ford vehicle  So if you try using something that requires using the compressor  it will stop you car  I did not know this at the time  so during a downpour  I needed to use my defrost because I couldn t see outside of my window  Upon doing this  my car stopped in a busy intersection and I was forced to push my car to the gas station that luckily was right near where my car broke down  I have no idea if this car just hates me  or if it is honestly a bad car  my suggestion  Please avoid 1990 Taurus like a plague  I knew two other people that had a car similar to this one and the air conditioner in their cars broke as well  If you live up north where the high does not reach 110 that frequently  then by all means  this car is probably the car for you  But if you live in a hot area  take your chances on something else br br
