 I got the car from Sunnyvale Ford  In my opinion it seems to be a good place to buy a car but not a good place to service it  If you want to service your car in the San Jose area  better go to Frontier Ford in Santa Clara I got the ZTS Sedan which had every option possible except Advance Track and automatic transmission  One reason I picked ZTS over SE is that ZTS has standard 16  wheels with 205 50 tires I test drove Focus ZTS with an automatic and I must say that it felt very lame  It shifts up at very low revs  while the engine likes to be revved   Later I learned that the new automatic transmissions  as well as modern engines   learn  some program parameters during the first 30 50 miles  This might explain the lameness of the Focus with automatic  but that is just a guess The version with 5sp manual transmission is fun to drive  The engine revvs very smooth  The power is available from low 2000rpm to well over 5000rpm  It is easy to cruise at 45mph in 5th gear  But I can also rev it and have fun   The thing I really like about this car is that it feels very stable in curves  So far I have never felt that the car was loosing grip in a curve  and I have tried to push it a few times The breaks are also very good  and ABS helps when it rains And now the COMPLAINTS After two weeks  about 750 miles  I noticed a bulge on the hood near the right hinge  I took it back to the dealer  It took me a while to convince them that the bulge was something that had to be fixed and that it wasn t me that caused it  The convincing part was that I found a bent steel rod under the front seat  which turned out to be a support rod for the hood  It appears that some moron  at factory  dealership  closed the hood with the rod still supporting it It took them 4 days to fix the hood  as it had to be repainted  It looks like new  I only hope that the paint will last as long as the original   I got a rental car for the period that my car was being fixed  however they initially did not want to pay insurance on the rental car  Eventually I got a  100 voucher to compensate for the money I spent on rental car insurance The center arm rest seems to have been designed for cars with automatic transmission  It is in the way when lifted up  and one has to lift it up to use a hand brake comfortably In May  when the outside temperatures got higher I noticed that the dashboard started squeaking like mutilated squirrel  sounded like two pieces of styrofoam rubbed against each other  It took me 4 visit to the service department before they finally fixed it by replacing the instrument panel bezel  Before they decided to replace it  they tried spraying WD 40  or something like it  between the bezel and the dash and loosening the screws that hold it  this made the dash rattle  so that I had to take the car back to the service where they tightened the crews  which made the dash squeak again   Altogether  this was very annoying experience At about 5000 miles I started noticing a rattle coming from the rear of the car  It was noticeable  and sometimes pretty loud  when driving over 60mph  It was difficult to locate precisely  but it seemed to come from somewhere near rear right wheel I brought the car twice to the dealership to have this fixed  First time they thought that some exhaust hanger was missing  It was installed but the rattle continued  Some 3000 miles later I brought the car again with the same problem  This time I went for a test ride with a mechanic  He could verify the rattle  He said that it was  a tough one  but did not do anything about it apart from adjusting rear right door which was a bit misaligned  Basically  he told me to see if this helps  and if not then to come again   I am sick of coming again and again to the dealership Fortunately  someone at www focaljet com forum gave me a hint to look at the aerodynamic deflectors placed in front of rear wheels and suspension  It took one look at it to figure out that they were the source of the noise  I wrapped some duct tape around them and the rattle stopped What it shows  is that the Sunnyvale Ford mechanics do not really know the cars they work on   In Summer I noticed that  on hot days the engine has much less power  especially between 2000rpm and 3000rpm  In part  this must be caused by airconditioning taking power from the engine  However  the power loss is there also with AC off I read some discussions at internet Ford Focus forums  and it seems that the power loss in higher temperatures is partly caused by bad design of the EGR  exhaust gas recirculation  system  It seems that the EGR valve opens too fast and at the wrong time  robbing the engine of power when it needs it most  i e  while accelerating Pity  because with the hesitation between 2000 and 3000rpm the car does not feel zippy anymore and is not such fun to drive  So in Summer the car is fun to drive only in the mornings when the air and engine are cool At 16900 miles the battery light came on  This time I took the car to be fixed at Frontier Ford  I also requested them to make and program 2 spare keys  I lost one  do something about squeaking rear brakes  and check if TSB 01 16 3  technical service bulletin  applied to my car  it is supposed to fix the engine stumble hesitation by reprogramming engine computer Frontier Ford did a good job on my car  They replaced alternator  made and programmed two keys for  87  replaced rear brake shoes  reprogrammed engine computer  and washed the car I haven t driven the car much since then so I cannot tell yet if the stumble hesitation has been fixed So what are my conclusions Sometimes I like my Focus  e g  morning drives to work  and sometimes I wish I bought a different car  e g  drives on hot weekends when it feels  felt  weak   I still have to see if this problem has been fixed Would I buy another Focus  I don t think so  If I were to buy a similar sized car now  I would probably go for a WV Golf or Jetta Would I buy another Ford  I do not know  I think Ford has some potentially good cars  They have good ideas  but they fail in implementation I do have another Ford  an Escape  but I think that its build quality isn t great either I think I will try another car brand  when time comes to replace my current Fords
