 Well its been a while since got a thread reply from epinion so will post what its been like with this car in over a year I too am very disappointed in what the car has to offer feature wise verus the MSRP price paid  over 40KwTT L One of the biggest was the lack of a full drivers information center giving an account of the cars functions  Your finding this now on cars costing half as much  At least it should have had Gas miles to empty It does not have dimming mirrors or lighted vanities The vanity mirrors are a sight to see  they are so flimsy and cheap looking  The car does not have a memory system to set seats  and other choices per drivers  The seats are very limited in power choices too  The passengers just goes backwards and forward  Would it have kill ford to put in a simple homelink system on the visor like the lincoln LS  after all its the same car basically No locking gas cap  they had to work overtime to cheap out this car  Another small item is the lack of clips to hold the floor mats in place  they are just light material sliding all over the place  The top is a major inconvenience off  its laying in the corner of the garage waiting till can get some friends over to put it back on  This seemed better than using that rickity looking cart  The cloth top has not closed properly since day one  I did go by a dealership but the repair recommendation made you wonder if would be worst off  Now for those wheels  they do nothing for the appearance of that car  looks like a hubcap set  As for running errands you are limited  the trunk is very shallow  a bag of groceries or even a slightly large boxed item will not fit back there  So you try and put it in the seat beside you hoping a brad is not on the bottom to scratch the colored seats  You do need a 2nd vehicle  practical  along with this thing On the motor I m not a mechanic but it doesn t have that much get up and go  It will go but not like the old push rod motors  You seem to plan your passing in advance  Top may be good but low end punch would be nicer  On the window dropping to allow door to open well don t open the door fast or it has not completed and shakes the glass  If it forgets to drop you have to really push it open  This may be a big problem as the cars age and more electrical glitches develop  All the articles and reports of unsold 02 03 units just sitting on lots with Ford slashing prices and offering rebate to try and rid of these cars  Does not make you feel good about spending this much on a car either  Gosh 04 s coming and they still can t sell the 02 s  Ford announced the cancellation of the car too after a year on the market
