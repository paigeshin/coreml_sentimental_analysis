 Okay  retraction time is here When I wrote my original opinion on my new Focus I was looking through rose colored glasses   actually Autumn Orange glasses  The car felt solid and responsive  looked cool and was inexpensive to operate That didn t last long In the VERY short time I have owned this car it has been recalled 9 times Fortunately for me only 3 affected mine  ZX3 I won t go into detail here  you can see all the recalls on the NHTSA web site The final straw came when the alternator started to go out  The lights would dim or  quot pulse quot  sometimes they would blink on and off  The real scary part was ocassionally you could actually see the firing order of the spark plugs in the dashboard lights   no  I m not a child of the 60 s I must commend Ford sales for an excellent job of reeling me in That in itself is not a bad thing  I admire a good sales person  It s when the sale isn t backed by good service that sets the tone for the rest of your relationship with the dealer  Parts were practically non existent and the service department personnel at 3 different dealerships seemed less than enthusiastic  Too bad for Ford   Great news for Volkswagen  VW took that pathetic car off of my hands and I now enjoy the nimble responsiveness and QUALITY workmanship of a 2001 New Beetle GLS  It is about  5 000 more on the sticker but not having to worry about what new problem lay ahead is so worth the price I can t describe the feeling br br
