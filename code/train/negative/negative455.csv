 I own a 1994 Ford Taurus  granted I should have done some more research  but I didn t  It was purchased in 1996  so it was only a couple of years old  fairly low miles  and I had seen the blitz about how safe the car is  It s a family mobile  you can even window lock the car so the kids can t roll down the windows  nice touch  The car is a V 6  but sure doesn t act like one  it s pretty slow getting started  but at least the ride is smooth Here are things that they don t tell you  and it cost me dearly  My car started to have trouble getting into reverse  it was idle there for a bit  then literally  quot kick quot  into gear  it s scary  it feels like the car is shaking apart  Then it started to do that when I put into drive  sometimes it would stall as well  I was getting really worried  so I go online and start checking my problems  It seems there is a manufacturing problem with certain years of the Taurus  Some of the parts are made out of aluminum  when it should have been made out of steel  There were even some lawsuits involved  and Ford of Canada noted this as a problem and agreed to fix some of those cars  This  of course  does not apply to Ford of America  In fact when I called  they told me there will be no financial help for a deficiency in their part  So what was the resolution  Let s just say it cost me about 5 month worth of rent  I had to have a rebuilt transmission  If I had gotten a new transmission  I could be in the same boat again  it really wasn t worth the time  or the effort  I don t know  maybe I am a bit bitter  but I ll never buy Ford again  especially for the fact that it is a known problem  yet they do nothing about it br br
