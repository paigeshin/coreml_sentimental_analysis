  Ever had one of those optical illusion books with pictures that looked like an old lady at one glance and then a young lady looking away at another  How  bout the one that looks like a woman looking in a vanity mirror at one take  and then like a skull at the next  The same effect was revisited for me recently when I first saw the  2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac   Allow me to explain b You see  up until now  sport utility vehicles have been a well defined group  Many of them are built on pickup truck frames  i e  the Dodge Durango  Nissan Xterra  The Ford Explorer Sport Trac is actually a reversal of this trend   it s a  pickup truck  that is based on an  SUV   namely the Ford Explorer   For you automobile savvy Epinions members  yes you ve stumped me  the Explorer  was  originally based on the Ford Ranger pickup  However  the Explorer has since become more rigid and heavier than its pickup cousin  You can see how I had a tough time figuring out what to make of the Sport Trac I had originally hoped that the Ford dealership where my friend works would receive a delivery of Sport Tracs soon  Alas  it was not the case  So  I placed a call at a large Ford dealership in town requesting immediate notification when the first Sport Tracs rolled onto their lot  Sure enough  my call came and I was at the dealership in no time    Note b  Normally  my reviews are based on test drives that take at least a full day  Since this was a new model  however  I could only drive it for about an hour  which is actually very generous of the dealer  I plan on driving the Sport Trac again once my friend s dealership gets some in stock  When I do I ll update this epinion and remove this disclaimer  For now  however  consider this a  quot short drive quot  review i b EXTERIOR  10  I ll let you draw your own conclusions about the way the Sport Trac looks  What I have rated so highly is the  design  behind the truck  There is much to tell  so get ready Although the Sport Trac was built on the Explorer frame  its dimensions are different  it s  14 quot  longer than the Explorer  and about an inch wider  In order to compensate for this length increase  the Sport Trac was modified to  improve lateral rigidity  by 40 Essentially  what we have here is a Ford Explorer that had its rear chopped off and converted into a pickup bed  The bed itself is not made out of metal  but Sheet Molded Composite plastic  Supposedly  it can withstand 400 pounds of impact per square inch  so Ford claims it s just as good if not better than steel in a car crash  The bed itself holds 29 6 cubic feet of cargo  which is about 3 cubic feet less than the cargo bay behind the rear seats of a regular Ford Explorer  Optional on the Sport Trac is a cargo cage bed extender which increases the bed space by 22 6 additional cubic feet of space  In addition  you can fold the 60 40 rear seats to accommodate still more cargo  Whether or not that surpasses the 81 cubic feet total cargo space of the Explorer is unknown to me The  cargo bed seems like it can stand up to some good use   Ford tested the bed with solid blocks of concrete and not a scratch was found  Ten tie down hooks make sure your cargo is securely held in place  An available option you might want to consider is a hard tonneau cover that protects your items  Right now  they re hard to find but availability will be better soon  Another nifty feature in the rear cargo bed is a weather proof 12 volt power point for whatever you d want to power up back there  camping lights  compressors  etc  The protective flip up cap reminds me of the caps on outdoor power outlets On the roof of the cabin   Yakima  not Ford  roof rails  offer more space to stow your belongings  They can hold 100 pounds of stuff when outfitted with the optional cross members b INTERIOR  7  The Sport Trac has many things going for it in this category and things I d like to see improved  First  the good The  dash is one of the best I ve seen on a Ford   The instruments are clearly marked  and I especially like the black on white gauges  The air conditioner did well to cool the cabin in the 85 degree weather  The stereo system I had was the four speaker system  which was satisfactory  though I d opt for the 6 speaker option myself  Another clever addition to the dash is an industry first  a power operated rear window  A dial on the right side of the dash can be tapped for lowering the rear glass by an inch  or turned to the left to bring the window down all the way  All of these controls were well within reach  Looking down  I noticed the  floor of the Sport Trac is actually rubber  not carpet   This is great for keeping the car clean and according to the dealer has a hand in sound insulation  Another feature you might find useful is the removable portion of the center console  It s actually a soft carrying pack for storing CD s  pens  papers  what have you  A final clever feature I noted was a clipboard that flips over for a second cupholder  Neat o Moving to the back  the  rear seats are quite roomy for a  quot pickup quot b  In fact  there is a full inch more of leg room than the Explorer on which the Sport Trac is based  Behind and under the seats  there are small cargo compartments for stowing little knick knacks Having stated the positives  there were many things I would change about the interior  First of all  I did not find the bucket seats on my truck to be very comfortable at all  The water resistant cloth is all well and good for staying clean  but it doesn t feel that great on the skin  I also would have liked more lumbar support  there was very little  Another negative was the  abundance of cheap plastic   not just on the dash but everywhere  that is endemic to all Ford vehicles  When I shut the door getting out  I was met with a resounding  CLANG  and not the solid thud that I appreciate hearing on cars b ENGINE  8  The 4 0 L  206 hp   5250 rpm  240 lb ft  torque   3750  V6 is the same engine Ford uses in the Ford Explorer Sport  and  scoots the Sport Trac along quite well   I was impressed with the engine s highway acceleration  which I got to test extensively  The Sport Trac is rated to tow 5 000 pounds  so the engine is good for light work only b HANDLING  8  The Sport Trac s handling is very  sure and confident  for a truck  Taking the car into a large parking lot  I swerved it left and right  noticing very little pitch  Taking turnarounds can be accomplished almost at the speed of passenger cars without squealing the tires  As far as emergency maneuvers  the Sport Trac performs well  too  While driving on an access road  an idiot pulled out right in front of me causing me to swerve out of the way just in time  After I had recovered my composure  I was thankful for the Sport Trac s performance in that situation  and was happy to know the  quot soil proof seats quot  would be there for me should a need ever arise again b RIDE  8  The Sport Trac handles better than the Ford Explorer SUV  no question  The ride  however  is  more stiff than the Explorer   That may be good for some  bad for others  If you want a lofty ride  then the regular Explorer is what you seek  not the Sport Trac  That said  I liked the way the Sport Trac rode  personally  Yes  I felt the road more  but other qualities were pretty good  Engine  road  and wind noise were all pleasantly muted at city speeds  At highway speeds  road and wind noise made themselves known  As far as the engine  however  I had to look at my speedometer to know how fast I was going because it gave me little help  that s a good thing b RELIABILITY  5  The Sport Trac is brand new for 2001  so it has no proven track record  My truck s cargo cage rattled when I hit bumps  and I also noticed some weathered rubber on the seal of the rear window  These are little observations  but they may paint a bigger picture later  On that note  be advised that you should  be wary of any first year model   If you can  wait about a year for Ford to iron the kinks out  If not  you might find yourself taking your Sport Trac into the garage for unscheduled maintenance or recalls  Ford is not exempt from this dilemma  the redesigned Mustang  the Ford Explorer  and Ford Expedition all had numerous recalls on them their first model year  Having said that  while my rating of  quot 5 quot  for an unproven car may seem unfair  and could be wrong  I m going on past history here  and am just making a point  At best  all Ford vehicles end up giving you average reliability anyway Food for thought b VALUE  6  The Sport Tracs were surprisingly in good numbers when I visited the dealership  When I asked the dealer about it he said they were selling surprisingly slowly  I don t expect that will always be the case because I feel the Sport Trac will become immensely popular  This is something to consider though  if a dealer tells you they are selling like hotcakes and uses that as an excuse to jack the price up For a base target price of around  23 000  the Sport Trac comes in  a little pricey  when compared to other trucks that most closely resemble it  The Nissan Frontier 4 door and the Dodge Dakota QuadCab pickups come in  4 000 5 000 cheaper  albeit a little more bare  Load the Sport Trac to the gills and it tops out at almost  30 000  a sizeable sum indeed Ford argues that because the Sport Trac is actually an  SUV  with a cargo bed and  not  just a pickup with four doors slapped on it  the sticker is well justified  Well  I d love to agree with them about that  but the fact still remains that those changes are all underneath the skin  Aren t the basic functions of the Sport Trac equal to the previously mentioned pickups anyway  Don t they all make the attempt at blending SUV and pickup characteristics  Who cares where the starting point is  SUV vs  pickup  Remember that this is just my opinion  and I m sure others think otherwise  All I m saying is that the issue of  quot it s an SUV  not a pickup quot  is all a matter of semantics  these important differences notwithstanding  By the way  the Sport Trac won t always be the only  quot SUV turned pickup quot  on the market b THE VERDICT  AT FIRST GLANCE  WHAT DO  YOU  SEE b In closing  I think Ford is really onto something here as far as new designs go  The Sport Trac is probably the best compromise between an SUV and a pickup  That s just my problem with the Sport Trac  however  what you are buying is a  compromise   It s neither the best pickup nor the best SUV on the market  In addition  this is an  introductory year   and I find it a bit pricey   For these reasons  put together i  I would not recommend it to a friend of mine b  My opinions may not speak for  you i  however  Ask yourself  does this compromise fit  your  lifestyle  If so  then maybe you should give it a look    And when you look at the  quot optical illusion quot  that Ford s rigged up  play the game for yourself  is it an SUV or a pickup  Ford hopes you ll see something entirely different  love at first site   AVERAGE SCORE  7 43 out of 10  b VARA S PERSONAL RATING  7 5 out of 10
