 1997 was the year that we leased the Expedition from Kearny Mesa Ford  and to say the least  that was the beginning of our NIGHTMARE  We got the Red Carpet Lease  whatever the heck that means  for 2 years and 15K Miles per year  We got the vehicle September 14th and we were so excited since its been a while since we got a new vehicle  much less an SUV  The next day  me and my family when to church and was on our way home and all of a sudden  the truck made this weird sound  We thought it was the air conditioning  so we turned that off  It continued to make that irritating noise  so my husband decided to pull over to the side of the freeway  That s it  The whole truck died on us  so we had to call a towing service and had it returned to the dealership  That whole incident freaked me out to say the least  After only one day of having the truck  the next day it s back in the shop  At that point  we called the dealership and told them that we no longer wanted the TRUCK  And the dealership said quot Sorry No Can DO quot  To make the long story short  we got stuck with that  598 00 per month lease but we are done with it and do you think I will recommend their dealership to anyone after they screwed us BIG TIME NO WAY And also  they should consider redesigning the front passenger seats it s way too uncomfortable br br
