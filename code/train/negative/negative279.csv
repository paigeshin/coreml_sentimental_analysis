 How many recalls can a car possibly have in 3 years time  We purchased a 97 Contour for use as a family car  liking the fact that is was a fairly affordable buy  However  from the very start we ve had problems with our vehicle  Upon taking it off of the lot  we had the check engine light on  the salesman informed us that it was a common occurrence if the gas cap isn t put on tightly and that it needed to go into the shop to have the switch reset  In 3 years time  we ve had at least 5 recalls sent to us from Ford  The excitement of having a new car wore off quickly when we noticed imperfections in the design and quality of the vehicle  Almost immediately our clock light burned out  The cupholder  a single one  mind you  was broken after pulling a purse off of the passenger seat  The carpeting on the floor was fitted poorly and hangs out from the plastic molding on the edges  There is no excitement whatsoever to driving this car  It looks like a clone to many other models out there that have no major design features to make it stand out in the crowd  Save your money and shop around for a better buy  you ll be thankful you did br br
