 After a disastrous encounter with a drunk driver in 1989  my husband bought this car  new  with the insurance money  Although we thought it was cool when we first got it  we soon outgrew it  Unfortunately  we could not afford to replace it until last year  when we got a NEW 2000 Nissan Maxima SE b First  what did I like about this car b It looked cool  with front and rear spoilers and ground effects  It had a low  throaty growl that just sounded tough  When I was 20  I thought this was   quot kewl quot i   Now that I m somewhere around 30  it s just noise pollution  This is a car that announces its presence   Guys  if you re considering buying this car and you still have a curfew  this car will make it impossible for you to sneak home after hours i I also liked the power of this car  At 225hp  the slightest touch on the gas would send the car hurtling forward  I could pretend I was on the  Batman amp Robin  ride at Six Flags  Somewhere around 1990 or 1991  I set my personal best land speed record on an unnamed interstate  at 115 mph   The car could go faster  but we were gaining too quickly on some state troopers ahead When I started dating my husband  he d just gotten this car  I did agree to marry him  so I guess you could say that girls dig this car b What DIDN T I like about this car b Where do I begin  First let me say that this car was maintained very carefully  even babied  and garaged as often as possible  Even so 1  The GT we had was an automatic transmission  which made this car a lot less fun to drive  Combined with a rear wheel drive and a lot of power  it was  almost impossible to control in bad weather   Even on plowed streets  the  Stang had trouble getting up moderate hills  Compared to my cars  89 Toyota Celica GT  90 Ford Probe GT  there was a significant decrease in the amount of control  even in the rain  I ve done donuts across 4 lane highways going 10 miles per hour in the Mustang  It s not an experience I d care to repeat 2   Overall poor design b  There are horrendous blind spots out of both side rear windows  making it difficult to pass other cars on the highway  Given that the sheer power of this car makes you want to go fast on the highway  it becomes very frustrating very quickly   Same with the hood  the slope of it makes it hard to ascertain exactly where the front end of the car is  making parallel parking difficult The car has the worst turning radius of any car I ve ever driven  There is no such thing as a 3 point turn in this car  Try 5 or 7 points to get this car turned around The horn is contained in two little buttons on the steering wheel  with the air bag taking up the center space  In an emergency situation  the last thing you want to do is to be looking frantically for the horn  Honking the horn on this car takes finger precision  you can t just slam on the steering wheel  All you ll get is a little  quot slap  slap quot  as you re looking for the horn The instrument panel and stereo are made up of lots of little buttons  impossible to use if you re wearing gloves  The only exception is the heat AC  which are dials that are easily manipulated  Same with the levers for moving the seats forward and back  small  difficult to find For a hatchback  it does not have much room in the back  The shape of the hatchback leaves the last foot of space virtually unusable  as it is only about 8 quot  high  The hatchback is also very heavy  Opening and closing it is a full upper body workout Needless to say  given that the roof of the car slopes down sharply after the front seats  the rear seats are uncomfortable for anyone over 5 2 quot  The front seats do not slide forward  and the front seat belts are attached to the rear armrests  so the front shoulder belt  quot clotheslines quot  passengers getting out of the back  Ever wonder what it feels like to be born  Trying to get out of the rear seats of this car is a pretty good approximation  Because of the attachment of the seatbelts  which seem designed for people taller than 5 7 quot  the shoulder belt is not really adjustable  If you are 5 7 quot   like me  or shorter  you ll get a red welt on the side of your neck from the rubbing shoulder belt 3   Things just break  over and over again b  This car does not have great reliability  It was fine for the first one or two years  and then it slowly began to fall apart  We noticed a constant squeaking noise within the first year  After several visits to the shop  they finally determined that it was the speedometer cable  After lubricating the cable  the squeaking stopped  For about two weeks  Eventually we just learned to live with it From the 3rd to 5th years of owning it  the fuel pump died  three times i  Each time was a  200  repair  not to mention car rental  There was never any notice that something was going wrong  it would just fail to start  Completely dead  No turnover Somewhere around this time  the A C finally died  too  I don t even remember what exactly the problem was  I think it was a freon leak somewhere in the system  Either way  it was  500 700 that we didn t have at the time The hatchback pistons stopped holding the hatchback in the  quot raised quot  position after 3 5 years  and the repair lasted another 3 years  Getting groceries out of the back  all 4 bags of them  involves lifting the hatchback in a clean and jerk motion  balancing it on your head  leaning  way  way  forward  remember the 8 quot  of unusable space at the rear of the hatchback  grabbing the groceries  and then ducking your head out fom under the hatchback  without getting clonked on the head or getting the greasy hatchback latch tangled in your hair   Now repeat  4 times After about 7 years  the power windows and locks started to go  They d only work some of the time  sometimes the window would go down crooked  and it made another loud   quot SQUEEEEEEEE quot b  noise as it was going up and down  Eventually  the entire console on the passenger side just died  I could not lock or unlock the door  or raise or lower the windows  For a while  my husband could control them from his side  Then they died altogether  and I had to climb in from the driver s side  or sit in the back  Not easy to do in formalwear The computer also did strange things from around the 5th year on  For a few months  the battery would drain overnight and we couldn t charge it up again  After we brought it into the shop and they  quot reset the computer quot  it didn t happen any more  The  quot check engine quot  light would come on occasionally  especially in cooler weather  below 40 degrees  About 50  of the time  there really was something wrong  and the other 50  of the time  there was nothing wrong  Sort of like your own version of Lotto  except each ticket costs  100 and you never win 4   It s expensive b  In addition to the aforementioned repairs  the  quot sporty quot  nature of the car means that equipment is expensive  too  The car came with Goodyear Eagle GT tires  With the original tires  on a dry road  the car was a lot of fun to drive  But the wheel size is odd  and pretty much the only tires that would fit were performance Goodyear Eagles and Yokohama tires that didn t last all that long  30 000   40 000 miles  In the ten years of owning this car  we never found tires to fit that were under  100 apiece Insurance  too  was very very expensive  Even with USAA  which is often 1 2 or 2 3 the cost of private insurance  my husband was paying around  1000 per year  with a perfect driving record and in a state with low insurance rates   To compare  I had a similar value Ford Taurus insured through State Farm and it was about  300 a year  His insurance went down a little when we got married  but not by much At best  the Mustang GT 5 0 gets around 15 mpg  Of course  it likes hi octane gas  We noticed a significant difference in the pickup and in the noise between 89 octane and 93 octane  Even before gas prices went nuts  we d pay almost  20 to fill the tank 5   Comfort  What comfort b  Thanks to the sporty suspension  the rock hard seats and the constant rumbling of the engine  you get a good feel of the road  every pebble and bump  After about 30 minutes  my butt would get numb from the vibration  I don t know if this is a good thing or not  on the one hand  you no longer feel every little crack in the road  On the other  you don t feel your own crack  either  and you climb out of the car waddling like the Brady Bunch after they took the mule ride into the Grand Canyon  In true muscle car tradition  there is also no insulation from the road noise and the engine noise  This was a typical conversation while driving in the Mustang i Dr  kboo   How do I get to  RRRRRRR  by the  RRRRRRR  i kboo   Turn right at  RRRRRRR  and then  RRRRRRR  i Dr  kboo   WHAT i kboo   Turn  right  at  RRRRRRR  and then  RRRRRRR  at  RRRRRRR  gesturing frantically  HERE  HERE  NOW SUMMARY If you live in a warm  sunny climate and you don t need dependable transportation  the Mustang GT 5 0 is fun to drive  when it s working  It s barely comfortable for two people  and can t carry much stuff  Whatever money you have left after filling it with gas will go to repairs  It is terrible for long road trips  as the seats are only comfortable for about 20 30 minutes On the other hand  even when we sold it last year  3500  at 10 years old and around 120 000 miles  it still turned heads  There will always be a market for this car because of how it looks and sounds  and because of the Mustang name and tradition I would NOT recommend this car as a teen s first car  it is difficult to handle even for experienced drivers  and expensive to insure and maintain
