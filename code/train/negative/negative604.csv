 UPDATE   Well  I decided not to keep it  Had a flat and the spare tire lock was corroded into place so bad the dealer had to tear out the spare carrier and replace it under warranty The brakes started grabbing pretty bad in the wet and the local dealer couldn t find the problem  The only reason I went to them was because the dealer I felt I could trust basically told me to take my truck somewhere else  Didn t even want to do the 35 000 mile check  Bottom line   Read the fine print  Ford s bumper to bumper 36 000 mile warranty is only applicable to problems that they find convenient to fix or  in fixing  won t reveal a major  costly screw up on their part Unfortunately  there wasn t another truck around that met my expectations after having the Ranger  Looked at SUVs   no go  Ended up saying to hell with it and bought a new 2001 Honda Accord EX V6  Hey  Ford  it could have been a maxxed out Taurus  but  well  you know how it goes ORIGINAL   The following opinion is as much a commentary on Ford as on my vehicle I ve got a  99 Ranger Supercab XLT Sport  2 5L  5spd  4x2 which I purchased on 12 31 00  It s been into a couple of local dealers in an effort to get  issues  worked out  I now have about 31k on it and am debating with myself whether or not to take the hit and dump it  I purchased the Ford as a replacement for my  87 Mazda B2000 Cab Plus which was getting a little tired after 12 years and 180 thou  It still ran OK and got 22 23 MPH on the road  but was getting pretty rusty and needed a new clutch I have had the fuel gauge sender replaced at about 2000 miles  Ford has real problems with these accross all their vehicles  from what I can tell  problems with the heater doors  the usual wiper switch problem  etc  What has surprised me is that Ford has had some of the same problems for years and doesn t do anything about them  Right off the bat  I started getting 16 MPH  I knew that the engine wasn t broken in  it was winter  etc  etc  but 95  of my driving is on the highway  I wouldn t have been surprised to get low 20 s  as the EPA rating is 22 27  Took it back to the dealer  who said they  checked it with their computer and it said 27 MPH  Pure BS   this truck never has and never will get anything above 22  With EFI  I had expected it to better my carbureted 2L Mazda The real clincher started to show up at about 5 000  I started to notice what felt like an abnormal amount of play in the drivetrain  like a bike with a very loose chain  accompanied by a noticeable  clunk  whenever I applied or released the clutch  I brought it to the dealer s attention and  after playing like they didn t understand what I was referring to  said it was  normal  It kept getting worse and I kept bringing it to their attention everytime I took it in for service  The service manager laid out a sheaf of TSB s which he said stated that it was normal for the  clunk  in the Ranger  When I pointed out that all of the TSBs only related to 4X4s  he couldn t come up with a justification  Thinking it was the rear end  I requested that they check it  They did and declared it to be  normal  More on this later After getting the Ford District Rep to check my truck  again   normal  I requested Arbitration   I live in Illinois and that s the extent of their Lemon Law  By this time the problem was affecting the shifting and was noticeable to anyone outside the truck  After doing the dance with the Ford s Dispute Settlement Board  it was agreed that I would get a new gearbox  because  after all  the diff was OK  Last spring a new 5 spd was put in my truck  No change  I started going to a dealer in another town  They took a look at the problem and immediately noticed play in the rear end  They found severe wear and ended up replacing everything but the ring and pinion  Still no change  A month or so later I stopped by to let them know I was still having problems and that it was now binding up on 1 2 shifts  Tear down the new tranny and replace synchronizers  Quite possibly my old tranny won t have had this problem A couple of weeks ago I took the truck in for its  30k service and to determine once and for all just what was going on  The mechanic who had worked on the rear end previously test drove the truck and thought the problem was worse than ever  He called Ford Engineering  who basically told him that they weren t going to do anything about my problem  Period  end of story  Another mechanic there explained that this attitude was the reason he had a Japanese SUV   he couldn t trust the American vehicles  So here I am  Do I keep it  and continue replacing differentials at my own expense  or dump it for another truck  I ve driven almost everything else out there and am even more disappointed  The Sport package on my truck provides the 4x4 suspension  which  with the rack and pinion steering  provides handling that literally nothing else on the market can match  short of shelling out for a 4x4 that I don t need  The 4x2 Toyotas handle like drunken sailors by comparison  even with the TRD package  The Dual Media  4 speaker stereo is the best I ve heard in a truck and many cars  The truck is a dream to drive down the highway  until I have to shift
