 A few years ago  in 1995  I bought a new Ford Mustang  I wanted to buy an American car  I didn t even think of getting anything else  I was trading in my Ford F 150  I wanted better gas milage  something cute  The first morning after I bring home my little silver bullet  it won t start  Ford has to come over and give me a new battery  I told them to come pick it up and take it back  I expect for the car to be able to start after having it for like 12 hours  No can do  It s now my car  I think I saw the paint turn slightly yellow  Naw  must have been my imagination  It couldn t be turning into a lemon  Ford built cars Ford Tough  So  I went to work in it  It was fine  For about a month Then the squeaking started  The dash squeaked the whole time the car was on  The really annoying high pitched squeaking  Then the cassette player broke  Ford said it was my tape  Ok  Then it ate 3 more tapes  I want a new radio  Ok bring it in  and I m just out for the cost of the tapes  I pick up my car  and guess what  Same radio  I had got some hair spray on the clock and I could see that the same pots were still there  Oh yeah  well  they knew that the radio wasn t replaced  they just didn t have one in  But the fixed the squeak  Cool  So I had to make another appointment to come in and have it put in  The dash didn t squeak for almost 2 full blocks  After that the back seatbelt broke  Then the front one  They wouldn t stay buckled  Then the engine started having problems  Then everything inside the car started breaking  Everything made out of plastic  that had to move  open or shut broke  It s a 1995 and has been in the shop 31 times
