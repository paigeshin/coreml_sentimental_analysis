 The only title the Explorer can lay claim to is the best selling SUV in America  It certainly can t call itself the most powerful  the best looking  or the best handling  In a nation where the Camry outsells any car  the best selling SUV title may not be so glamorous  And the facts will back that up The base engine in an Explorer is a little 4 0 liter 160 horsepower deal left over from the early Explorer days  Coupled to a manual transmission  this engine is slow  sluggish  and a good choice  Seem paradoxical  Consider this  The next level up is 4 0 liter V6 with 50 more horsepower  Yet it is not a big step up for the money  0 60 figures improve by only  3 seconds and quarter mile times by  2  Still not convinced the base engine is the way to go  Consider the top level engine  It is a 5 0 liter V8 with  scoff  2 valves per cylinder  Given a whole extra liter of displacement and 2 more cylinders to work with  the engine only gains 5 horsepower from the next step down  Most surprisingly however  0 60 in a V8 Explorer will take you 9 seconds  as opposed to 8 7 in the considerably cheaper base model  I m almost always a fan of a bigger engine  but in this case  I say save your money  Why shell out more for an 2 valve cylinder V8 that only goes slower than the base  and has 14 miles per gallon  quot efficiency quot   note  the V8 carries more torque  so if you need to haul something  e g  a boat  you might consider it  but for hauling kids  keep your money Roadholding in an Explorer is characteristic of an SUV  That is  a lot of body roll  a lot of bounce  and a generally uncomfortable ride  Again  the base model shows its true colors  with a skidpad reading of  73g  opposed to only  70g for the V8  Likewise  suspension is nothing revolutionary  It is a step up from the Ranger pickup that it s based on  but still bouncy  On the plus side  the Explorer is safe  given its standard airbags and disc brakes  but please stay away from Firestone Wilderness A T s  It is also roomy  accommodating 4 people well  4 people who are not susceptible to motion sickness  and 5 people for short hops br br
