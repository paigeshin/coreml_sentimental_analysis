 Most car manufacturers have a line of cars that are highly profitable because they have not had to change them in years  A few cosmetic upgrades here and there  and the vehicle is launched as a new model year The Explorer has been around for over a decade and the 2001 Explorer Sport is the most modern interpretation of this old platform  New grill  body cladding and white gauges can t hide a rigid rear suspension  poor gas mileage and some old demons such as poor build quality b Engine  The dealer told me that the 4 0 V6 in the Explorer was the German built powerplant designed to lower emission levels  Very smooth but very thirsty b Transmission  Mated to this German powerplant was this new French transmission  After 2 months  this transmission failed and had to be replaced  This left the car at the dealership for almost two weeks  The flip side of this was that I had a nice little Focus to drive b Interior  Wonderful seats and a nice update to the standard Explorer interior including white gauges and faux brushed metal door handles  Every piece seemed to be made from quality materials  However  in the 2 door Sport model  the front passenger seat was difficult to slide back to allow access to the rear seats  Very strange given the wonderful 2 door mechanism there was in a Ford Probe I used to have   the front passenger seat would slide out of the way  This would have been a nice feature in the Explorer Sport Nice touches include the puddle lamps off the mirrors b Problem areas  Rear fixed window leaked and had to be rebeaded and replaced  Rear windshield wiper motor failed  Matte finish of the front door arm rests wore off in just 3 months  Ancient rear suspension meant very bad handling in parking lots over bumps  As mentioned above  the transmission failed right in the middle of traffic and it took almost 2 weeks to have it replaced  The transmission problem lead to major arguments with the dealer  Ford Customer Relations and the service manager b Dealer support  Um  non existent  The problem areas had to be escalated to Ford Customer Relations to resolve  Because the Explorer Sport ended up being serviced for over 30 days  I qualified for the California Lemon Law and I eventually moved to a Ford Escape  The dealer experience was so bad that this will be my last Ford since I ve been driving Fords in 1985
