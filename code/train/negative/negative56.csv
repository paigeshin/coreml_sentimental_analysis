 I will NEVER buy a Ford vehicle again  I bought my 2 year old Taurus from a reputable Ford dealer  They told us that the car was just off of a lease  It had never been in an accident  the brakes were new and we still would have one year left on the original warranty  We bought it the car and the story  The brakes had to be totally redone after just two months  The Ford reason for the rust and corrosion was the car had  quot stood quot  too long  Yeah on their LOT  Then there s the TRANSMISSION  First it was a hard shift on my automatic transmission  They adjusted the computer  Then it needed still more adjustment  This dealer couldn t fit us in for 4 weeks  So we tried another Ford dealer  They wouldn t touch a car that another Ford dealer had already touched  We called FORD s 800 number  They said the second dealer had to take us  The dealer then said they were too busy to get us in  We called the original dealer and asked for a loaner as we didn t want to damage the transmission  They refused and said we weren t damaging the car  When they did finally see our car they said we needed a whole new transmission  They then said that the warranty had run out and besides it must have been something we did  We ve since learned that Ford Taurus has a history of transmission problems and obviously don t back their product  NEVER EVER AGAIN br br
