 Our 20 year old son purchased a Ford Focus a few months ago  Paying  12 995 for this car  we didn t expect luxury  but we did expect good quality  So far that s not what we ve found Shortly after purchasing it  he received notification of two recalls  which of course the dealer promptly took care of  From there  however  it s been lots of little things things that will undoubtedly eventually nickel and dime him to death  if the car even retains that kind of value The Focus feels like it s made of tin and plastic  Leaning on the hood or trunk will sometimes cause buckling  The bumpers are constantly detaching from the vehicle and the front side panels are  too  My son has finally resorted to a type of automotive  super glue  to fasten these parts back onto his car  He has tired of the weekly trips to the dealership The Focus is an attractive car at an attractive price  and this is sadly part of the reason young buyers are flocking to Ford dealers to buy them  They are sporty and economical  Fifteen dollars a week is all my son has ever spent on gas  and some weeks have seen quite a few miles Yet I remain concerned about the safety of this vehicle  as it doesn t appear to be solidly built and besides  who wants to trust a vehicle to protect its occupants if the outside parts keep falling off Aside from these complaints  my son does insist that his Focus runs like a dream  It has good pick up and is easy to handle  His is a standard My son s Focus came with cloth interior and a great stereo system  The CD player was included I guess if one is looking for a cheap set of brand new wheels  the Focus is enticing  However because so many young people are purchasing it  due to its affordability  I do have deep concerns regarding safety
