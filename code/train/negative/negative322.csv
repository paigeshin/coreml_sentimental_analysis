 I bought the vehicle when it was 1 year old and had 32000 miles  It looked terrific I bought an extended warranty In that year and a half I had to do the following Replace the rear window motor Replace the Tires Replace the Brakes  700 00 4 Safety related recalls Replace the front windshield wiper motor Replace a heater vent damper  300 00  mostly labor  or I wouldn t have heat Check engine light came on  they replaced the valve cover with a  revised design Two weeks later  the Check Engine Light came on again  this time they replaced the Intake manifold gasket with a  revised design  plus a bunch of other emission control stuff that apparently got ruined by the bad gasket Even though Ford paid for a portion of a couple of these repairs under the warranty  I had to pay deductibles  pay for rental cars  they only had a loaner once  and only helped defray one of the rentals once  and the majority of all repairs was not covered by the warranty  I spent several thousand dollars to keep the vehicle running over the course of a year and a half Other issues that I did not try to fix Squeaks  thumps  bumps  rattles  plastic interior pieces that got warped by the sun  gaskets falling off all the time around doors  overall sloppy assembly and bad fit and finish My actions speak louder than anything I could write  I meant to keep this van for 10 years  but it was so bad I dumped it after a year and a half
