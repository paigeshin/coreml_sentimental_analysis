  updated Jan 03 Hello all  an update to my windstar review is required  For those of you that do not tend to keep your vehicles for long periods  you may not care  for those of you that plan to keep your vehicle for 3 years or more  please read my update at bottom I never thought we would buy a mini van  I never liked the shapes  some of them look like bugs  Then I saw someone driving the 1999 Ford Windstar and I fell in love  I sent my husband to look at them  and he fell in love  Why First off  let me explain that we have 2 children  one in a booster seat and one in an infant seat  Plus  my husband is 6 feet 6 inches  We had to upgrade our car to a bigger car  a SUV or a Mini Van  The car seats and my husband could not fit in our car anymore  We tried numerous SUV s but none of them in our price range  around 25k  could fit my husband with the seat all the way back and the infant carrier  Until we got to the Windstar  We all fit very comfortably in it  My husband can finally drive a car without his knee s being in his chest  The only place he cannot fit is BEHIND the 2nd bench row  But  even when he is sitting in the second row  he is very comfortable  We purchased the LX model with 2 doors  one of which is an automatic door  For the additional money we spent on it  I was leary of it  However  its fantastic  How many times do the kids run to the car to wait for you to open the doors  not anymore  just press the button and they can get in and start getting buckled in  I have found that my mini van is getting excellent mileage  I can go about 260 miles with a full tank before i HAVE TO get gas  The car is user friendly and I love the overhead compartments that comes with the back seat headphone jacks so the kids can listen to their music and I dont have to The main thing that I do not like about it is that I keep the 3rd row seats in because I never know when I am going to need it  however  then I don t have a lot of room for my groceries Also  they sell a cargo net  but really they should include it for safety so that bag of canned goods wont fall on our feet One tip  no matter what car you are purchasing  I almost could not afford the monthly payments for this car  Until we went online and found a dealership near us  not the one we were using  that specialized in online selling  We drove to them  about 10 miles from us  and we got about  3 000 in savings because we used the internet to locate them  so keep your eyes open Jan 05  04  Update  We have now owned our mini van for 4 years and 6 months  I have put somewhat more then average miles on it  i now have 62 000 miles on it  I have to say that i am looking to sell my car asap and will not get another ford windstar again  Since my car was 1 year old  i have had MAJOR mechanical problems  of course these problems  big and small  were completly covered under the warrenty  I have had 2 new transmissions  a new axel  8 tires  and i do service regularly including rotation  fuel pump problems  many recalls  automatic door problems  new brakes added  humm  what else  i have had to have the lines flushed  air conditioner fixed  cd player replaced  had to have the entire power sliding door mechanism replaced  new front and rear break pads and rotors can i think of anything else  well i m sure there is more it will come to me  Unfortunatly  i have also had major problems since my warrently expired that i have had to pay out of pocket for  Since my warrently expired in july  2002  I have spent about  4500 on car parts service not including normal servicing  I am shocked that i have had these problems  but when we take our car into the dealer  we find that others have these problems too  It also seems that the dealers have trouble correcting our problems the first time because we somehow always seem to have to go back to get the same problem fixed 2 or 3 times before it actually gets corrected  yet  the service people never fail to remind me that the most important thing to them is getting an  excellent  rating on any survey card i receive afterwords  yeah  like thats gonna happen  Inside  everything is ok  i still like the look  the space  the price  etc but i will never get a ford windstar again due to the mechanical problems that i should not have with a car with only 49 000 miles and a provable service record
