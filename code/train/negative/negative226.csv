 Note All of the bad things I am about to say about the Ford Windstar only affect Windstars with the 3 8 litre engine  This is the engine used in over 90  of Windstars  even the base models  but if you have one with the old underpowered 3 0 litre you should be alright My parents bought a 95 Windstar LX loaded with most options in 97  It had about 50000km on it  We really liked it  It was in perfect shape when we got it and we bought it from a dealership we had bought from before and they were really good to us  The bad part of the story doesn t start until our last year of owning the vehicle We got an extended warranty on the van because our previous vehicle that we traded in on it  a 93 Mercury Sable  had quite a few problems before the warranty ran out and we didn t want to have to pay a lot of money to keep the thing running  The extended warranty went to about 120000km I think  For the whole warranty period we didn t have one problem with the van  It ran perfect  had good power  was comfortable and we really liked it  I can t remember us having any problems with it at that time The bad news happens later on around 145000km we got a recall notice  actually an extended warranty on a defective Ford product  stating that they will cover the cost of repairs to the head gasket on Ford Windstars up to a certain mileage and date  not very far ahead of the current date at that time  We took the van in to our local dealership  not the one we bought the van at  and this was a big mistake  They say they checked it out and the headgasket was fine  About a month later  past the extended warranty date for the headgasket  at 150000km my parents were driving on the freeway and all of a sudden cold air blew through the heater  Then my dad noticed the temperature gauge was almost as high as it could go  He immediately pulled over  When he opened the hood there was antifreeze everywhere  They got it towed back to the local dumbas  dealership  They looked at it and basically said  Sorry  it s not covered anymore  It s gonna run you  1800 2000 to get fixed  Needless to say my dad was kind of ticked off  The next decision we made was a good one  We called the good old dealership we bought it at  who we had been unfaithful to by bring the van to the other dealer in the first place  They told us they would come pick up our van  from the local dealership  and tow it for free out to their dealership  There had been a lot of complaints to Ford and we were waiting to hear there decision on whether or not they would cover the cost  Meanwhile my mom has to drive to work every day  a 45 minute trip  and my dad has to drive to work at a different time in the morning and a different direction  Our only running vehicle at this time was the trusty old 1983 Pontiac Grand Prix  still running at this time  We called the dealership to see if they could do anything about this and the guy we bought the van off called Ford and seemed to really make some noise  Anyways in no time at all he got Ford to pay half the cost and he decided to chip in 1 4 of the cost  This left us to pay only 1 4 of the cost and we were pretty happy about this  A week later we got a letter from Ford saying that they were sorry but there is nothing they could do  This notice meant nothing because our dealership had already got Ford to pay half  If he hadn t done that we would have been stuck with a big repair bill  In the end the dealership replaced the headgasket and while the engine was out they replaced the spark plugs which did need replacing and they also replaced a belt that was worn  Even with all of this the total bill came out to about  1200 which we paid 1 4 of  This was much less than the estimate the a hole at the other dealership gave us The van seemed to be running fine after this and we were planning on keeping it for a while still  However about a month later with about 155000km on the van mom said something weird happened a couple times when she stopped at a redlight  When she stopped at a redlight and then started to go again she stepped on the gas but the engine just revved up like it was in neutral and then clunked into gear with a lurch  We had a trusted transmission mechanic take it for a test drive but it didn t do anything wrong when he was driving it and it didn t most of the time when we were driving it  He said he would have to take the tranny out to find out if anything was actually wrong and that s already getting into big money  We decided to trade it in as soon as possible on a smaller more economical car  We traded it in and it had seemed to be working alright until the day we were driving it in to pick up our new car  the worst possible time  it started going into neutral at stoplights a few times and when my dad pulled into the parking lot of the Dodge dealer  My dad felt terrible and was really upset by ripping off the Dodge dealer but if we hadn t traded it in we would have been broke  Ford puts cheap a  parts in their vehicles that are known to fail and the customer ends up paying for it in the end Our Windstar gave us reliable transportation most of the time we owned it  The only other problem we had was when we were in Florida the starter connections had gotten corroded and the van wouldn t start  We couldn t get it started even with a boost and had it towed to a Ford dealer  They claimed it was a dead battery so they would rip us off when it only needed a new  5 part  Ford dealerships suck  I only know of the one good one that saved us a lot of money on our blown headgasket  Our Windstar was totally reliable up until about 150000km but that s when the whole friggin drivetrain gave out  This is unacceptable especially considering how much it costs to get these parts replaced  It s also almost impossible for most people to work on these vehicles  Our 1983 Pontiac Grand Prix has never once been in a garage the whole 3 5 years we have owned it  We do all the work on it ourselves and have spent about  100 in repairs the whole time we have owned it The other day I just got off a long day of work and was driving in the grand prix with the windows up and the stereo turned up and there was a windstar on my right with a Quebec license plate and he had his left turn signal on  I figured he didn t know where he was going and was trying to get somewhere so I slowed down a bit to let him change lanes in front of me  He didn t change lanes and I soon realized his had his 4 way flasher on not his signal light and he was going about 25km h in a 50km h zone  Don t know why I thought he was turning  but anyways all of a sudden I realized I could hear an extremely loud knocking coming from the Windstar engine  Right away I thought of our old van and all the complaints about the Windstars that I had read  I passed the van and a little ways up the road I stopped in at a car lot to casually look at cars and listen to the racket from the Windstar as it passed by  I waited for it to come over the hill and I could hear it before I saw it  It was the loudest  most unhealthy knocking I ve ever heard from any engine  That engine had to be TOAST  It looked like they were just trying to make it to their destination and give up on the vehicle  If it s knocking that loud you don t keep driving it unless your not worried about fixing it anyways  It sounded like the engine was about to blow up right then literally  It s undescribable  I m a major car nut and obsessed with engines and this was kind of amusing to me to be able to listen to an engine in such bad shape    I thought it was fun but I definately wouldn t tell the owner of the van that  Anyways with the amount of 95 Windstars giving up the ghost out there  you are bound to see something like this eventually Now that I ve told you all the bad things about the 95 Ford Windstars I ll talk about the good things about it Performance  The engine had good torque and power at all speeds  The transmission shifted extremely smooth most of the time that we owned it  The gas mileage that we got was surprisingly good for a van with this big of an engine  Handling was alright for a van and the brakes worked really good  Comfort Features  The front seats were really comfortable  The back seats weren t great for long trips and were impossible to fall asleep in but our van didn t have the bucket seats in the back  it just had 2 benches  The buckets seats  actually called captains chairs I guess  are a lot more comfortable  The air conditioning worked great with the rear air  There are vents in the ceiling that work good to keep all passengers cool  You can close the vents if you want  The rear heater was awesome  I guess it was kind of a safety hazard as it could melt a plastic bag if one was left right next to the vent on the side of the floor  But it sure heated us up fast in the winter  There are plenty of lights in the van all the way to the back so you can see in the dark  There was 3 power outlets in the van which was handy  Sometimes I plugged in my Discman to the power outlet at the middle seat so I didn t waste batteries and on our trip to Florida we plugged a portable refrigerator thingy into the very back power outlet  This was really handy  The factory stereo only had a tapedeck and am fm but it was decent for a factory system  I also liked the design of the interior on this van  It was nicely done  It s hard to remember all the little features cause it was a while ago  but there were lots of them and it was nice Safety Most people know that the Windstar got rated for 5 star safety rating so I guess it s pretty good for safety in a crash  Not so safe to get stranded out in the middle of nowhere in the winter but at least your safe in a crash I guess Anyways  as you can see I have plenty of good things to say about the Ford Windstar but I don t think they re worth it unless you re rich enough to be able to afford the repairs  In that case you could probably buy something a lot nicer than the Windstar though  I have heard a lot worse  Windstar Horror Stories  than ours since we only had the 2 major problems  I bet that guy from Quebec could tell you a good story about his Windstar  The newer ones have corrected some of the problems but on www cartrackers com  forums and then go to the Ford Windstar page  its the only vehicle that gets its own forum on here  lol or go to  My Lemon  there still seems to be a lot of problems with the newer Ford Windstars  I wouldn t recommend one
