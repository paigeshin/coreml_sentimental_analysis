 I ve owned 87 cars in my life  some new  some very old  but this Mustang takes the cake  Over 80 000 miles and NO repairs  NO problems  Heck  I haven t even had to change the brakes yet  Whoop s  my wife just reminded me  we had a turn signal bulb that went out  Total repair costs in 80 000 miles  2 95  AMAZING  Plus we get 25 27 MPG around town and on a recent 1600 mile trip averaged 32 MPG on the road  And that was as she purred along at 85MPH for a good portion of the trip  The seats are comfortable  yet offer enough support that even on our long trip  we never felt fatigued  The 3 8L V6 is smooth and responsive And this being said from a guy who drove BigBlocks in the 70 s with ample power   She will sqaull the tires from a dead stop  and when my wife isn t with me  I just love blowing the doors off the Hondas  Acuras  Toyotas  and what ever other piece of Jap Crap is cruising the local boulivard   Even us grey hairs like to have some fun now and then  My boss has the same year Camaro V6  and I can out run it  out gas mileage it  out handle it  and I don t have to fix it once a month  and all for only  4000 LESS than he paid  Then there is the obvious  It s looks  Bright Red  on one of the best body styles of the 90 s  This car is just flat beautiful  It looks mean just sitting there  buy is sleek enough to slice through the air with outstanding aerodynamics  Sure the back seat isn t that big  but it holds my 2 teenagers  who would much rather be driving her  with no problems  though I m sure they wouldn t want to take a long trip back there  And yes the trunk is small  but it IS a sports car  not a sedan  If you need more back seat  or trunk room than what this car has  then you shouldn t be driving a sports car  I highly recommend this car to ANYONE looking for a car with some flare  great fuel mileage Performance  EXTREME RELIABILITY and less expensive than anything in it s class  MUSTANGS RULE
