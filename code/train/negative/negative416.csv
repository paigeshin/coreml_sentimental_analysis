 In general AVOID this car at all costs  unless you LOVE to crawl under the car every night to fix something  Oh the list could go one forever  visit the  read this before buying a ford taurus  website  My personal problems  transmission replaced twice  motor mounts three times  ignition switch  twice  broken springs on the rear  fuel pump whines  brakes failed three times  power steering hoses blew  wiper motor failed  plastic ends of radiator leaked  and many more that I can not remember at present  Do yourself a favor  spend the extra   on a Camry  Dont get sucked in by lower priceing  You WILL live to regret and wind up spending the same   in the long run
