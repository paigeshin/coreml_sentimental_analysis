 I am in a construction business that forces me to move from one area to another as projects end  With a new project assignment comes a new company vehicle  This time it s a 2000 Ford Ranger  a step down from my previous Ford Explorer  Needless to say  I was not happy for this downgraded vehicle at first especially with the stripped down absolute base Ranger model  But  it s free  so I don t complain I must confess that I am not a truck person  so I probably would never buy one with my own money  I have ridden a Ford F 150 that is much nicer than a Ranger  but I would still prefer a car or an SUV over a pickup truck  I understand that some people are just the opposite we are all different  Another fact is that it is difficult to like a cheap vehicle once you have gotten used to a more expensive one  Liking a particular vehicle is therefore all  quot Relative quot  to what you have been used to  If you are stepping up to a Ranger from that 1970 VW Bug  you will love the improvements such as acceleration  quietness  etc  However  if you have been driving a 2000 VW Bug  this is a giant stepping down for its sluggish acceleration  noisy interior  and sheer ugliness  There  you get the picture of Relativity The Ranger I drive has no optional equipment other than its 4 speed automatic transmission  It even come with manual window cranks that I thought have long gone away from automotive industry  A pickup truck is good for carrying stuff from hardware stores to my new home  It s just convenient to throw things in the back and go as long as it s not raining  If it rains  there s not enough room to put anything inside the cab  And for the obvious reasons  it s not convenient to shop from store to store as your purchases are exposed to open area unprotected  My Ranger came with a standard vinyl bench seat  and this is definitely a back killer for longer drives  In another words  it is very uncomfortable to drive more than 30 minutes or so  For me  a seat comfort is the number one importance more than any others  The 4 cylinder engine gets less than 20 mpg for combined city and highway driving making you to think it has good performance  However  its acceleration is  by today s standard  very poor  Also  my accelerator pedal sticks in the morning  so pressing it harder makes it  quot jump quot  initially  This problem goes away after the engine warms up  While driving it is fairly easy  handling is not  Making a turn requires a gentle touch  needing to come to almost a complete stop Forward visibility is good because its higher sitting position  but I was quite surprised to find out how difficult it was to check my blind spots  It definitely has rear spots that are harder to check Again  I drive it because it s free  not because I like it  If you are a  quot truck quot  person  then this could be a no non sense worry free vehicle  Then again  if you are used to a pick up like F 150  just forget about getting a Ranger as you will be dreadful  Where is your Reference Point br br
