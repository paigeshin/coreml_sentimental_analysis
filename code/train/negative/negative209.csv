 The Ford Ranger is a decent pickup truck for light loads  I bought this truck for moving stuff like a lawn mower and stuff like that  I loved this truck because it drove really smoothly and it looked pretty sharp  I hated this truck because it has no balls  I mean come on a truck is suppose to be manly  The only way i can feel like a man is if i can wax someone at a stop light  good luck doin it with this truck  The sound system in this truck is terrible  The speakers are for old people who dont like to crank it  Another reason why it is not a good truck is because of the sad engine that they but in these  Come on a V6 in a new truck is not needed anywhere  If you want a truck that can do something other then pull a small trailer with a small load i wouldnt recommend this truck at all br br
