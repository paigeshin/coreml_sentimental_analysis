 I was excited to get this vehicle as my next company lease vehicle as I thought the styling was good and offered utility in a better package Initial impressions were good as they were based on the engine performance and handling  Both are excellent and it went pretty well in serious snowfall as well As I lived with it  some interior CHEAP details started showing up  I know the plastic world  and Ford has used the cheapest plastics possible on this interior  My seat panels  next to the center console on the seat frame  are warped so badly that they will not stay in place  they pop off on one side  The seat belt cover on the b pillar is cracked and fell off  The interior light is horrible  Instruments are fine  but the dome light stinks  You have to turn it on with a switch ON the light  Ok  it is on but 90  of its light goes to the back and when you turn it off you have to set the switch in the middle  door  position  otherwise it is off regardless of opening doors etc  Trying doing that while driving and you think cell phones are dangerous  Try a simple dome light switch on the IP Ford  Also  hardly any of the door  heaven forbid the steering wheel  controls are lit  I believe the only switch lit is the drivers window  Also  why does the window lockout switch also lockout the driver from controlling these windows  CHEAP  Front seats need armrests  My XLS has a center console that is basically flat I think the XLT has a higher console that can be used for an armrest  Needs a rear cargo net too NOISE  The wind and tire noise  not to mention the squeaking rear hatch window combo  is horrible  You have to turn up the radio so much that once you stop  it is blaring  I try to use my heads free cell phone headset and can t because there is too much noise  Try turning on the recirculating AC you hear this big WAP from the HVAC system nice touch Warranty repairs  My steering started screaming and whining  so the dealer replaced the entire rack and 2 days later the tensioner idler pulley exploded losing all belt driven accessories  which includes the power steering  and required a roadside tow   I didnt know the problem at first and losing steering assist 2 days after they replaced the rack is a bit disconcerting  OH  and I complained about the squeaky rear hatch and the dealership s remedy was to remove the dealership license plate frame and charge my lease co   85  Which did nothing for the squeak of course Summary  Again  nice styling  nice engine  nice handling nothing else is nice  Noisey  quality problems  and obviously cheap on the interior  I never get better than 18mpg  3 0L V6  Coworkers get 24  with the same engine in their Taurus  That is alot of wind drag
