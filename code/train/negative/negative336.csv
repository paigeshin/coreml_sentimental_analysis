 It s a cheap car  good for a  quot first quot  car  but then again maybe not  I bought the car from my sister for  1 000  it is a 1992 Ford Tempo GL  I probably put about a  1 000 into it already  My dad warned me though  quot You get what you pay for  you are going to have to put money in that car  since it is so cheap quot  Well  I sure did  I had it less then a year  and It s been in the shop probably 7 times  New Brakes  Starter  All tie rods  battery  muffler  and a bunch of other little things  that all add up  not to mention a transmission leak  that s been leaking for years  OH  and for the interior problems  Two out of the four windows don t work AT ALL  they neither go up or down  The  quot power locks quot  never work  and the car makes a lot of noises when idle  The ride is pretty rough  and loud  I am currently looking for a new car  hopefully a 1994 Honda Accord  It tells you something when a car like the tempo is recommended 25  of the time  with 2 out of 5 stars  and the Accord is recommended 95  of the time with 5 stars br br
