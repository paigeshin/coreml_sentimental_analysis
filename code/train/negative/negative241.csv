 We own a 1994 Ford Explorer with the Eddie Bauer package  It s a great looking vehicle  all the comforts you d want  Leather seats  Lumbar  electronic everything  The most expensive component was the A C  It eventually started getting warmer and warmer and this year we took it in to be charged  Well  that model already used R 134  But Ford charges a fortune for it  Plus that had to  fix  the leak  where ever that was  A truck that s 8 years old didn t just spring a leak  They could have charged it up and it would have lasted another 8 years  But instead  they  fixed it  and the bill was  1200  Then a week later  when it finally got warm enough to use the A C  I tried it and the car died at 55 miles per hour  I had to steer up a hill and off the road  The compressor went out  AFTER THE FIRST USE  So back the the repair shop and  650 later we had A C  for two weeks  Then it quit being cold  We took it back and their new compressor had gone out  but I made them pay for repair  Another big headache was the Four Wheel Drive  I need the four wheel drive daily because I live atop a large  rocky hill  You push the button and the light comes on and you go up the hill  Well eventually it got harder and harder to climb and then you d have to romp up it in order to get home  Well  after spending  450 in tires in one year  I took it in  the Ford dealer told me they just get old and lose their power  Well I wasn t exactly convinced  I jacked it up and there was no power at all  I took it to a mechanic and he found the automatic hubs to be bad  Well  with the Explorer  you have to get them from Ford  no aftermarket available  So for  400 a tire I got my 4WD back  My last Chevy cost me  129 for a pair of hubs from Warn and I was back on the road  but it cost over  900 to get the Explorer working again  The vehicle has plenty of great featurs and it s comfortable  but the modern technology comes at a great price as it ages
