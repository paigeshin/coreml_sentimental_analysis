 I owned two Ford Rangers  First  1989 STX Ext Cab  and currently 1999 Ranger Standard Cab  Both 4WD  Something has happened in those 11 years  First Ranger I drove for 8 years  Ran great  4WD worked well nice bucket seats  solid build  good turning radius  but a bit under powered This current beast is an entirely different animal  It began to make questionable noises within my first year of ownership  I m 6ft1 and a little too big for the interior  Very uncomfortable and the seats did a number on my back Then came the recalls  1  Steering column wiper blinkers assembly 2  water pump 3  THE TIRES  which I must ad  are horrible quality  When I did some investigating  I found even more  features Now  I bet you re wondering if drive my vehicles hard  NOT AT ALL  I have owned this rolling nightmare for 30 months  and I only have 14K miles on it  All of which are basic city driving To  William Clay Ford  get to work you silver spooner  you just lost another customer
