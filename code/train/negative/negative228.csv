 I bought this vehicle when expecting my first child  We chose the Windstar because it had excellent safety ratings  I like the way the minivan looks and rides  I have enjoyed the car overall until the last 3 months or so  I received a Recall in  98 on a certain engine part that could cause the head gasket to blow  I took the van to my local dealer  from which I bought the vehicle  and they claimed to find no problem and therefore would not replace a part that wasn t broken  The exact thing that the recall was for happened in November  99  I was informed that the recall had expired and they could do nothing for me  I had the problem fixed by an independent mechanic Approximately two weeks later I received another recall on the fuel tank  This time stating that it could fall off the vehicle  I definitely feel that unless you are willing to deal with the recalls and repairs you should not purchase this van  I do not know of the status of the newer models  but I am not willing to take my chances and buy another Ford Windstar br br
