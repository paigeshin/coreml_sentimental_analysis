 I bought my 1999 Ford Explorer in April of 1999 factory ordered  Since then I have had approx  15 recalls  That is annoying when I have to keep taking it back to the dealer to have something fixed  I have put 16 000 miles on it and have had it in the dealer shop six times for repairs  from fixing a window to the windshield washer and wipers not working  I had to get new tires because of the Firestone suit  When I went to change the new tires  I had to pay for it up front  which was more than  300 00 I had to borrow  I was reimbursed within ninety days  Cutting corners has about given me a heart attack on several occasions  I m not the best driver  but the potential for my Explorer to flip over on a tight corner is high I m not totally against my Ford Explorer  it s roomy  comfortable  seats five people legally  It has plenty of space in the back for traveling  Safety rods that run across the back space  I use the rod to secure my groceries  Air conditioning  a cassette radio  I asked for a CD player and never received one  I also asked for running boards  didn t receive them  Gold trim  got Black trim instead  I m finished experimenting with SUV S  Next time I think I ll buy a Mercedes  Maybe it s the dealer to blame  but all those recalls  I say something was made wrong
