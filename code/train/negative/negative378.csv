 I have a 1993 Ford Taurus with a V6 3 8L engine  The Ford Taurus is a nice car  It is very roomy for a family of four  There is plenty of trunk space and is a comfortable ride for family trips However  at 50 000 miles the head gasket cracked  Coolant was leaking into the exhaust system causing billowing white smoke to come out of the tail pipe  I opted for a rebuilt engine as purchasing another car was out of the question as a car with a cracked head has little trade in value Now  Ford has increased the warranty for 1994 and 1995 Taurus vehicles with 3 8L engines to 7 years or 100 000 miles  According to the letter  if you have already paid to have the head gasket repaired  prior to the date of this letter  March  2000  you may be entitled to a refund of your repair costs  Obviously  Ford has had lots of complaints and bad press concerning their 3 8L engine  Ann O Neill  director of Vehicle Service and Programs even states that Ford  quot is committed to maintaining satisfying and and long term relationships with our valued customers  and demonstrating that commitment through actions such as this quot  I guess I am not a valued customer as Ford told me that there is no recourse because my model year is 1993  It is a low mileage car as it is now close to 7 years old with 61 000 miles of which 11 000 is on the second engine  My car clearly fit the textbook case of what they were trying to correct with 1994 models As previous reviewers of the Taurus have stated  there is no gray area with rules  only black and white with Ford br br
