 The Ford Mustang may have lots of beef  but the one in my household just can t handle the power  My mother let me drive it to my prom last year and I was going to a party in which I had to travel about 4 exits on the interstate  When I arrived at my destination  there was enough smoke coming out from under the hood to attract the local fire department  When I came home  my mom thought that I broke it  She took it to the local Ford garage  and they said that a piece of plastic had blown up in front of the radiator and blocked to air flow through it  This is a sign of poor engineering and I hope that since the 1997 model  Ford has fixed this flaw  It costed my mom over  1 000 to fix  Then after a couple months  when my mom took the stang in for a rough shifting problem  they told her that a part had been recalled for her model of Mustang  This part happened to be the exact plastic piece that heated up and cracked when I drove it  Another incident is just to note the quality of our local Ford garage  My mom took her Stang in to get a new battery and cables  A week later  her battery died again and she popped the hood  There was tons of corrosion caked al over the battery terminals  When she took it back to the Ford garage  they admitted that a new battery had never been put in  Then they tried to tell her that they would put a new battery in  but she would still have to pay for it  She told them to put in the battery and that she would expect not to pay for it  When she came to pick up the Stang  Her bill said   quot no charge quot  After this attempt to cheat my mom out of her hard earned cash  we have decided that the Stang is the last Ford we will own br br
