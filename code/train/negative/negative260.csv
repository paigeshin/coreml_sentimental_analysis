 1995 E 150 Econoline  conversion by d Elegant  300 I 6  E4OD  3 55 1  aftermarket interior and exterior  7000  GVWR  aftermarket rear heat and a c Background I have owned and driven Ford vans since I was 16 years old  I started out with a 1970 E 200 with 240 cid I 6  I have owned Ford vans with almost every engine available in them  I have used Ford vans for solo commuting  recreation  hauling band members and band equipment  hauling merchandise for distribution  hauling freight in the  quot Just In Time quot  expedited freight business  hauling students  and now pulling my 25  travel trailer Currently I own a  94 E 350 Clubwagon Chateau  460 V 8  E4OD  4 09 1 differential Formerly the topic of this review  I owned a  95 E 150 Econoline conversion van  conversion by d Elegant  The front suspension on this van was bad from the day I bought it with 43 000 miles  It was back at the selling Ford dealer about 5 times within the first month  and then other Ford dealers and alignment shops thereafter  The last alignment that I had done was at a reputable truck spring shop  They told me that the front coil springs were almost worn out  Because of the aged springs  they had to change the bushings on the ball joints to the maximum angle to align the van  They stated the condition of the springs and bushings on their invoice and stated that the next time it is aligned  it will need to have the front coil springs replaced before they will align it  I know that this shop is reliable and trustworthy  but what about the selling Ford dealer  I had the salesman write in the sales agreement that the van would be properly aligned BEFORE I took possession of it  Well  I found out that it was never on an alignment rack before I took possession of it  After the sale  the service department at McCandless Ford in Mercer PA gave me nothing but lip service about aligning it  They even sent me out on the road with the technician so that I could approve the work  Well it felt good on the 2 lane road that we drove it on  but it pulled when I drove it home on the interstate  That is when I made the appointment at the spring shop to take a look at it  I think that Ford had a problem with the E 150 chassis in  95 and nobody told me about it The 300 I 6 engine was very economical  I normally got 18 20 mpg hwy  but it dropped drastically to 10 mpg pulling the trailer  A quiet engine  good torque  but no power to pull our 25  travel trailer up hills and keep up our speed  There was no room for acceleration when pulling the trailer The E4OD transmission didn t do to much hunting  However  I stopped the hunting by locking out OD when it would downshift the first time  I would then ride out the hill in 3rd or 2nd The 3 55 1 differential gave me no problems The conversion company is d Elegant  The short comings that I found with the d Elegant conversion is the bay windows by Creation  seating by Dygert  sub of Flexsteel now  and the aftermarket rear heat and A C  I experienced the wind whistling in one of my bay windows  I found the rear chairs to have seats as hard as rocks  and I found the after market air to be really weak as far as the blower and the freon  There is more to a vehicle than a pretty looking interior and exterior paint job This E 150 had a tow rating of 5000  and I bought a travel trailer with a 4900 GVWR  The 300 I 6 in stock condition would pull the trailer well if my speed was under highway speed  However on the highway  I could not ever maintain the speed limit if I were pulling any degree of upward grade  In fact  I was often locked out of OD to pull grades and even sometimes in 2nd gear to pull big hills  While the E 150 was good for economy  it was not a good camper toter I would recommend the drive train to anyone wanting a dependable truck engine  who is going to use it at lower speeds  I would not recommend it to anybody who is doing alot of highway travelling  I would not recommend any conversion van to anybody because the parts that the converters use I replaced this  95 E 150 with a  94 E 350  In the deal I got OEM quad seats  6 way power driver s seat with lumbar support  OEM rear heat and air  OEM windows  heavier front coil springs  heavier tires  heavier rear suspension  I am very pleased with my trade br br
