 I feel compelled to write this so noone else buys a Windstar  Maybe these vehicles are reliable for the first few years but then they go bad VERY quickly  I suppose the Winstar would work well as a leased vehicle  Any longer than 2 4 years and you re in for trouble I purchased a 98 Windstar and unless they ve made HUGE changes I can t imagine the new ones being much better  We know a Ford engineer we live in Michigan  and she say s Ford really cheapens out the Windstar parts  Everything is taken down to the bare minimum for nearly every important part  The Windstar is a big money maker for Ford During the 6 years of Windstar ownership I went through 1  Strut Replacement 2  Transmission rebuilt 3 times thank GOD for AAmco and lifetime warranty 3  Head Gasket blowout 4  Weird CLONK noise in front when going over bump very loud and nobody could find out what it was 5  Right side door lock made loud  craaaaank  noise when locked  Never fixed 6  Replaced Starter 7  Gas tank gasket seal broke and interior smelled like gas 8  Serpentine belt  tensioner pully  broke twice 9  Back end continually rattled while driving  Never fixed 10  Muffler had an O2 sensor  socket  blow out  Had to have the threaded nut welded back into the muffler 11  Power Steering  creeked  and was hard to turn  Never fixed 12  First 60 days of ownership the vehicle was in the shop for transmission issues nearly 45 days 13  The back plastic hatch handle inside  broke off several times 14  Tiny hub caps were replaced several times Obviously I m no longer a Winstar fan  In fact I regard it as the worst money I ve ever spent in my whole life  The Firestone repairman constantly said the Windstar and the Taurus were the 2 worst vehicles on the road  During the past 2 years we NEVER felt comfortable taking the Windstar on a long trip  The last trip was 12 months ago through Virginia and we swore the transmission was slipping  When we got back home the AAmco guy rebuilt the transmission for the 3rd time Needless to say I m done buying Ford and have moved to the Honda s  This is the second Ford vehicle to let me down  The first was the older Ford Granada but that s another story Dave
