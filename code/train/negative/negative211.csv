 I don t own this car  but I have driven and ridden in it as a passenger  This review will share some of my experiences in the car First thing  the car makes bumps feel like craters in the ground  You will feel every little pothole in the road will tooth jarring clarity  SOmetimes when driving the car when I hit a bump  my arm smacks the armrest  made out of hard plastic  and my arm feels like it fractures  This does not say a lot for the struts shocks or the armrest Next item  the car sits straight up and down  I thought that I would be lying down and driving with an arm extended  but this is not the case  I sit very up and down  just like driving a regular non sports sedan  One nice thing is that the driver s seat has a lumbar support that blows up to the size of the Goodyear Blimp  If you have a crampy lower back  this is nice  However  there is no passenger lumbar support The car has good leg room  as I am 6 2  and do not feel cramped  especially in the passenger seat  The headroom is OK  but the car is cut in such a way that I have to be VERY careful when getting in and out not to smack my head  Once I had to bend over so much to get into the driver s side that I pulled a muscle in my chest and was in pain for the whole next day The car has an annoying feature of the window opening all the way when just pushed down a little on the driver s side  Since I like to crack the window even in the winter  I hit the down button just a touch  but the whole window opens  However  I am told this is standard on new cars  as is the lack of a cigarette lighter  so I suppose I ll just have to deal with it The car has standard airbags  but no head airbags or side airbags  so just make sure that if you plan on crashing  you get into a head on collision  not a side impact On the plus side  the car has a nice sound system and it looks cool to drive around in  The color is nice too  And the thing really moves  The V8 in the GT has a lot of power and great pickup for highway merges
