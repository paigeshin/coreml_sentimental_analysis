 I had a Ford Taurus that was a deathtrap so I went to a Ford dealership to buy a new car  thinking that they d have to take it  I was planning on getting a Ford Escort GT but they only come in stick shifts  So the sales person steered me towards the Tempo  The price was good and it was shiny new so I bought it  I also bought the extended 50k warranty  Before the car hit 25k the fuel pump went  Repaired for free  Then the starter went  Repaired for free  Then it went again  Free  The third time was less then 6 months after  2 and they wanted me to pay a  50 deductible  The boyfriend type man convinced them that they did NOT want to charge me  The next time my car wouldn t start  similar situation to when the starters went  a friend suggested I put the car in neutral and let it roll   and it started  From that point on I was constantly rolling and starting it  Looks stupid when you re not on an incline  Finally the rolling technique stops working and I tell the Ford dealership to put in another starter  They keep it for the day and say there s nothing wrong with it  the starter is  300 and do I really want it  I take it home  and it promptly refuses to start  I take it to the local car repair shop and they diagnose a starter cellanoid and fix it for  29 00  I also asked the Ford dealership to repair the stupid clicking noise the heater fan  which is constantly on  makes  This is  200  and  of course I ve already had this fixed  The Ford guy just shrugs and says  quot oh  these things keep breaking quot  like that means I should just keep paying for it  The car just turned 86k so I m not happy about all of these repeat repairs  since I m the one paying for them now
