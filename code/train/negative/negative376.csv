 There have been two serious problems with the Taurus and Sable vehicles  Mainly  it s the transmission  The AXOD and AXOD E automatic transmissions  Introduced in 1986  these things have apparently been designed in haste It s noteworthy to mention that this same transmission has also been used in Ford Windstar minivans and  I think  in Lincoln Continental sedans AXOD transmissions have been used in Taurus and Sable vehicles from 1985 to 1991  An electronic version  called the AXOD E  have been used in the redesigned Taurus and Sable vehicles from 1992 to 1995 These transmissions have used an aluminum accumulator piston which has been known to crack  Ford s TSB  Technical Service Bulletin  indicates that the aluminum piston must be replaced with a steel one  When the piston goes  the car will not upshift properly  if at all These transmissions do not provide adequate lubrication to the planetaries  The planetaries are a set of orbital gears that transfers the torque from the engine to the wheels  Apparently  the transmission does not distribute enough fluid to those gears that they overheat  They eventually will break down  When the planetaries go  your car will not move  If you were moving when those gears go  you will coast to a stop  This problem has also been indicated by Ford through a TSB This vehicle has also used the Essex 3 8 litre V 6 engine  These engines are notorious for developing problems with the head gaskets  A lot of vehicles in Ford s lineup have used this same engine  like V 6 Thunderbird Cougar vehicles and V 6 Mustangs  Fortunately  these engines are easy to identify  Just pop the hood  The intake plenum  which is a big slab of metal on top of the engine  should have this written on it in big letters   3 8 FUEL INJECTED V 6 There is a TSB which lists replacing the head gasket material with an  improved  version  along with replacing the head bolts with ones that have higher torsion to achieve a tighter compression of the gasket for a better seal  However  there have been reports of leaks even with the improvements  Most leaks seem to occur after flushes of the cooling system Ford s execution of recalls to affected vehicles have been less than stellar  Model years covered are only 1994 and up  Owners of vehicles years 1993 and down are not being honored  Off topic  it has also been commented that Ford has had a reputation for  lawlessness  in comparison to other American car companies in terms of responsibility to their customers in the event that a potentially dangerous design defect becomes known  Ford has been known not to take action in face of these circumstances  The only other company I can think of that is worse in this regard is Kia If you want a second generation Taurus  as they are the best looking Tauruses in my opinion  opt for the 1995 model as they may have the updates applied to them  Also  in addition  get only a Taurus or Sable with the 3 0 litre Vulcan engine  If you wish  get a SHO model  All SHO Tauruses use super reliable Yamaha V 6 engines  and some SHOs use manual transmissions  which avoids potential transmission problems inherent in the AXOD altogether  However  When something does go wrong with SHO cars  they are expensive to repair if major parts are required as parts for SHO vehicles can be difficult to find One way to check the transmission s condition is to check the fluid s condition  If it s cherry red  it may still be good  although the fluid could have been replaced to cover up a transmission problem  If the fluid is brown or brownish with a sharp  dirty odor  avoid the car as the transmission had been overheated  Particularly a concern with cars using the AXOD automatic transmission Check the engine s head gasket condition by checking the oil  If the oil looks murky and light brown  and can even sort of have an appearance like chocolate milk  then avoid the car as the head gaskets have leaked Smell the oil  If it smells burnt  avoid the car  Burnt oil usually means that the engine had been overheated  Overheated engines can develop head gasket problems prematurely  and engines with head gasket concerns to begin with should be particularly avoided in this instance Also  as always  try to obtain all the service papers for the car in order to ascertain how it s been taken care of  as well as to reveal if any major repairs had been done or not
