 The Expedition is one in a long list of truck based SUV s  It s basically a short wheelbase Ford F 150 with a steel roof in back instead of a bed  and a rear seat or two  So  despite their bulk  and popular misconception  they re actually not as unwieldy as your typical extended cab pickup is  because of the shorter wheelbase  Ford also tosses in a few minor luxury features and softens the suspension to differentiate it from the pickup and also to somehow justify the whopping  9 000 price differential  Expensive rear seats and roof  aren t they Here are my impressions on the Expedition Exterior Styling  While not glamourous or sexy  the styling works  It s a bit top heavy  due to the cargo maximizing design  and the wheels are a bit narrowly offset  with more body overhang than I d like  But who are we kidding  You re hauling around babyseats in the back  You won t be crusing the boulevard in this SUV  Interior  Much like the F 150  it s functional  though it retains some of it s truck based look and feel  Buttons are large and well placed  the guages are easy to read  and the center console is huge and very useful  Cupholders are fine  which is one of my  quot must haves quot  Interior materials are tasteful  better than the Chevy Tahoe  but there is still a somewhat plasticy look you have to pay  40 000 for an SUV to avoid  My main problem with the interior  and this vehicle in general  is Ford s incredibly uncomfortable seats and seating position  I am 6 0 quot  and cannot seem to find a position which does not induce severe discomfort after a minute or two  The seat back is too hard  and there is a lack of proper side bolstering to hold you in when the body rolls in turns and roll it does  When I get the seat set where my legs are happy  I can t reach the wheel easily  This causes major back pain from overreaching  And when I get the seat set so my hands feel right  my knees feel crowded under the dash  The 2000 models have been improved somewhat with adjustable pedals and improved seat materials  but they are still not the greatest  Be sure to test drive the Expedition well before buying  You may regret it if you can t get comfortable  Rear seat room is cavernous  with plenty of room to put in car seats and full sized passengers  Three accross seating is acceptable  at least for short trips  The 3rd row seats are a weak point  however  They come in handy when hauling large groups  but are best suited for children  The problem  as with most 3rd row seats  is that though they re best suited for small kids  it s hard to get the very small kids back there and buckled in  So again  it s best for occasional use  Buy a minivan if you are always hauling a team around  The A C and stereo systems are acceptable  though nothing special  I would suggest aftermarket upgrading if you are an audiophile and skipping the included upgraded CD system  Ride handling braking  This is never the strong point of an SUV  but the Expedition has a smooth ride  due to its soft springs and suspension setting  Wind noise is acceptable  but handling suffers  at least on 2wd models  due to the excessive body roll  This is a subjective thing  but you tend to wallow in turns and it limits your ability to maneuver in emergency situations  Braking is adequate  though it s no sports sedan  Part of the safety factor of big SUV s is negated by their inability to maneuver as quickly to actually avoid an accident  So drive within the vehicle s limits Engine driveline  The 4 6L V 8 is a tad underpowered by modern standards for a vehicle this size  but it certainly isn t a pig  The 5 4L gets up and going faster  but adds to the cost and reduces fuel mileage slightly  If you re hauling a lot of gear and people  spring for the bigger engine  If you re choosing between a less opulently outfitted Expedition and a loaded Explorer  choose the Expedition and the cheaper engine  It s a much better value  The transmission is smooth  with none of the lurching I ve found on Chyrsler products  It s not in the class of a Toyota Tundra  however  But few other trucks and SUV s are  when it comes to smoothness Reliability Safety Ford Expeditions have been fairly reliable  The one I ve spent time in has zero breakdowns or warranty problems in 38 000 miles  I would rank them above Chrysler and GM products  though behind Japanese and German makes  The dealer network ranks from great to pathetic  so ask around to find a good dealer  I have two excellent ones in my area  Safety is a great reason to pay the extra money to get a full sized SUV rather than a more practical compact  5 000 lbs of bulk and increased ride height goes a long way in protecting your family in a crash  Expeditions have not been tested  but the similar F 150 has outstanding crash test results  Some of the best around  in fact  Missing are side and head protection airbags  But only the most high end cars had them when the Expedition was introduced  Expect to see them in the next re design  If you are looking for a minivan alternative and need seating for more than 5  the Expedition is a good choice  The new Tahoes have a slight advantage in the on the road experience  but I would be wary of their spotty reliablity  With the Optional 3rd row seat  you can carry 7 on a long trip  But if you re like me and others I know  and can t get comfortable in the front seats  this vehicle is NOT the one for you  It s unfortunate  because this SUV is a good value for the money So is the Expedition really a beached whale  Well  if you do not have a family or do not really need the extra space  there are some newer  smaller  better driving SUV s on the market  They will be more nimble and cost less to operate  I am very impressed with the new Acura SUV  It s slightly more than a loaded Expedition  but gives you a better  faster ride  more refinement  Acura warranty and quality  and more maneuverability in parking lots  It s somewhat smaller  but the newer design means more safety features  side airbags  that somewhat cancel out the Expedition s size advantage  If you need the size  but want more refinement  wait and check out the new Toyota Sequoia  Not cheap  but resale value will probably be great  Some other decent alternatives for those who do and do not require a full sized SUV Full sized or near Chevy Tahoe GMC Yukon Toyota Sequoia  late 2000 Dodge Durango  smaller  but 7 seat capacity Isuzu Trooper   the best dollar value out there compact mid sized Acura MDX Lexus RX 300 Ford Escape Nissan Pathfinder br br
