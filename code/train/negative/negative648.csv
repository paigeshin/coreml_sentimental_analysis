 I bought a 1990 ford probe gl in 1998  i payed 2500 00 for it used  the car was a very good deal at the time  I am a certified mechanic so i check out the car throughly  Finding nothing really wrong with the car i purchased it About 6 months after i bought it the rack and pinion went out  1 week after that the radiator went out with the lower control arm  the headlight motors the exhaust system the automatic seatbelts  the passenger side mirror  the power steering pump  the rocker arms and oh yeah finally the fuel pump wires arched against the gas tank when i ws driving and the back of the car went up in flames  I got out in time before it was too late  So my opion is do not buy a old probe it is nothing but headache br br
