 For the first four years of ownership  I loved my Ranger  Unfortunately  I held onto it for about 2 months too long So you ask what was the problem I had with mine  Here s the short list 1  Both O2 sensors burned out 2  The emissions computer crapped out 3  Multiple oil leaks 4  The transmission started to slip 5  Major crack in the intake manifold So you are probably saying that I beat my Ranger to death  right  Well  you would be wrong  I had a 4 liter  Supercab that I took meticulous care of  It was driven less than 15 000 miles  mostly highway  Aesthetically  it was in near mint condition  I regularly had it serviced  even had the transmission fluid changed a couple times  I was burned several years ago with a transmission that needed to be replaced prematurely  and swore that I would never let another one go due to the slightest hint of neglect When I was getting rid of my Ranger  I traded it in for a 2002 Toyota 4Runner  I couldn t bring myself to try to sell that crap can to an unsuspecting private party  my mechanic told me how several years ago Ford replaced the former metal intake manifold with a plastic one  no doubt to save  5 to  10 in the assembly plant So in the end  I can only warn people to beware of your Ranger when it hits that 60 000 mile threshold  You may be sorry They don t call the company F   ix O   r R   epair D   aily for nothing Sophiedog
