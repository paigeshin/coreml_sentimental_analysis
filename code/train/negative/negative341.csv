 I finally took a close look at a Ford Expedition I ve been a 4x4 owner since the sixties everything from CJ5 Jeeps to Ramchargers to Broncos  I had the feeling from afar that this new Ford rig was not like anything I was used to I was right It drives like a big heavy station wagon  with a slightly stiffer suspension than would have been found in the big wagons of the 60 s and 70 s  Handling was fair   but the old Bronco has it beat in terms of predictability on bumpy turns  Loaded heavily  the Expedition has a tendency to develop rear end sway and instability at highway speeds  It did NOT feel like a truck at all   and of course  that s Ford s intent  The interior was impressive   all kinds of little gadgets  rear air  etc  etc  The seats were comfy  the driving position good  For forty grand or so  it should be fancy When you look at the front suspension  you know immediately why it rides as it does struts  CV joints  torsion bars it s a car suspension  not really for trucks  That s OK for the average owner who has gotten one because he or she needs a big  tall station wagon with 4 wheel drive  This machine will NOT do well off road in really nasty conditions  It s obviously not intended to Raise the hood and you see a backyard mechanics nightmare  If you like to work on your own machine   say  to change the plugs once in a while  do oil changes and the like   you will not enjoy this machine  Half the engine is up under the firewall cowl  Change the plugs  Not from the top  you won t  But if you can afford one of these  you can afford to have it worked on and cost of doing a job under the hood will be high   lots of stuff in the way and lousy access means longer times for various maintenance tasks I don t like the Expedition at all  Looks great  drives OK  nice interior appointments   fine for anyone who is not a 4x4 purist  But if  like me  you want something you can fix in a pinch and take anywhere  then this ain t the rig for you br br
