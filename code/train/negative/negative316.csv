 I purchased a 1999 Windstar in November 1998  Initially  the car operated perfectly  However at 10 200 miles  the car locked up while in drive and nothing I could do would get it to move  After about 25 seconds  the car surged forward very fast and I had to slam on the brakes to keep from hitting a car crossing in front When the light turned green the car operated normally The dealer in Tampa replaced several computer  transmission parts and assured me that everything was ok  Three weeks later it did it again  The dealer could find nothing wrong with the car Upon moving to Alabama in July  the car repeated the lock up  I explained to the dealer that it was a safety issue and that I could be killed if I accelerated from a stop sign and the car refused to move for 20 seconds and then surged into traffic  Again  they could find nothing wrong and there were no tech bulletins from Ford addressing such a problem  In January 2000  we were left sitting in a busy intersection when the car refused to go and then in 15 20 seconds  surged into traffic  The Ford dealer contacted the regional rep and they promised me a new transmission in one week  Three and one half weeks later  the transmission arrived and seemed to be ok  The second week  I noted that the transmission abruptly downshifted at about 42 miles per hour and slowed very quickly even though I was accelerating  It was as though I had downshifted to  quot 1 quot  The dealer gained access to a tech bulletin and adjusted the transmission  Today I drove and found that the transmission does not downshift at 42 MPH  it downshifts at 53 miles per hour  So much for Ford tech bulletins  so much for  quot Reliability is job one quot  I have written complaints to and called the NHTSB and they have done nothing  I have called Ford several times without success  Has anyone else had similar problems  If so  did you avail yourself of the Lemon Law  Did Ford offer a financial incentive to purchase another Ford product br br
