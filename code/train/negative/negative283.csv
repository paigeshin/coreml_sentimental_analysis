 I recently got to test drive a 2001 Ford Mustang with my friend who is going to buy it  The particular car we drove was a V6 manual transmission convertible  I ll say it right now   the car looks really cool  I felt like a millionaire driving it  Bright yellow with a black convertible top  and a black leather interior  It s definitely a fun car  but only on the outside On the inside  you re treated to horribly uncomfortable font bucket seats  and an even worse rear seat  Even though everything was covered in soft leather  the seats were hard and unforgiving  I can stay put in my 1991 CRX for 6 hours without a single problem  but my back hurt after half an hour of driving this beast  Not only that  but the legroom was awful  I can completely stretch my legs out in my CRX  I m 6 1  but in the Mustang my knees hit the dash with the seat scooted all the way back  What gives  I realise it s a sports car  but how hard would it have been to give you a couple extra inches of legroom  I won t even talk about the rear seat  it s more of a storage space for your stuff that won t fit in the tiny trunk than a place for people to sit Next up  performance  For a car that looks so pretty  you d expect it to have the innards to back up it s racey look  Not so my friend  I actually street raced someone  I know  not smart  who was driving a Miata  I could see they had a five speed too  but here s the thing  Miatas are rated at I believe 135hp   they re also a 4 cylinder  while the V6 Mustang is rated at 160hp  The Miata won  and I was disappointed by the lack of performance in this beautiful car I was driving  It was like driving my mom s Civic  except extremely uncomfortable  and with poor handling That reminds me  the handling  I m used to my little CRX  which can stop on a dime  and with the right tires make 90 degree turns are 30mph  The Mustang seemed to hesitate when making evasive maneuvers  The car is pretty heavy too  which made it feel more like a truck than a sporty coupe Needless to say  I can not recommend this car  It s too unrefined for my tastes  and lacks the amount of power you d expect from a legend  My friend bought it anyway  and that s great for him  But I ll stick with my CRX  thank you very much
