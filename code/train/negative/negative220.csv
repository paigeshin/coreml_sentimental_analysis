 Okay I wrote a review a couple of months ago that I have since deleted saying that the Ford Windstar was a great buy  Unfortunately  I have had a change of heart and would not recommend it to anyone not even my worst enemy Okay at least not the 1995 version or any version with the 3 8L V6 engine  I have had a nightmare within two months time coupled with  4 000 00 repair bill  First of all the head gasket blew and I had to have that repaired to the tune of  1 600 00  About one month later my van decided that it would no longer go into reverse  Not a big deal unless you want to BACK UP  So back to the repair shop it goes this time needing a brand new transmission to the tune of  2 600 00  I have yet to get this fixed because I simply cannot afford it  So I hit the net and find out that Ford has known for a long time that this particular year Windstar has had constant trouble in this area  They did offer to refund  900 00 of the head gasket repairs but will not replace or help with the transmission which they are very aware is bad  Their response was  quot Well it is not on recall yet  When it is they will refund your money quot  Hello am I the only one who sees something wrong with this picture  Well I thought I was until I went to the consumer report page and heard some horror stories about the same vehicle  If you are looking for a used car  Go to carfax and run the VIN number and find out it s history  It is  14 00 that I wished I had done  Now I am stuck with a car loan owing more than the trade in value and a repair bill that this one income single family cannot afford  Do not dump your money into this lemon  I hope others with other years never have the same problems  So far they have not had problems with the other years Sometimes you cannot take lemons and make lemonade br br
