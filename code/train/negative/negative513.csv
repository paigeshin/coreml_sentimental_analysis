 I recently rented one for 5 days to go skiing up in Lake Tahoe  On the road  the car  you ll see why I call it a car  performs well  It has good power  reasonable handling and for an SUV  good gas mileage  The seats are not particularly comfortable  If there s a little snow on the road  it seems to do fine  I didn t need to chain up  My primary complaint is that this so called 4x4 performs poorly when it get s a little deeper  I got stuck  The 4x4 system doesn t make sense  I m in 6  of snow  a bit off to the side of the road  The wheels that have traction don t want to move  while the wheels that slip  continue to slip  It s as if the system only powers the wheels that have the least amount of grip  The system has an Auto 4x4 mode  Neither system worked  I could not discern a difference  Ok  that  coupled with the questionable reliability  I think that you get what you pay for I got pulled out by a Toyota 4Runner   My next vehicle  or perhaps a Pathfinder  I was also considering a Honda CR V  but I suspect many of these wannabe 4wd systems will eventually leave me out in the cold  Granted  I know real 4WD vehicles will also high center and get stuck  but my situation was not even close
