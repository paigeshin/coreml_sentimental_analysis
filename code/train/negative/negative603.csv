 What could anyone be thinking to buy this truck  As my good friend Foxspy said  its not a truck  Its a compact car with an oversize trunk b Pro  s you say  You want pro s to this car  Ok  I ll try  but its not going to be easy It sits five people  That s nice  What I left out in the original sentence is that it sits two people comfortably  The red paint is really nice  as said before  Ford really knows how to do paint  they might as well be able to do something right  Four doors is awesome  it has the two butterfly doors  making loading easier  but not easy  The Tonneau cover that this truck came with is a nice addition  but even it has its cons  It offers a full size spare  but what pick up doesn t  That s enough for pro s  I m worn out with all of this thinking  I m going to something that comes a little easier b CONS b This is the Princess of  quot Fix or Repair Daily quot  The model of which I speak is a 1999  little over 15 000 miles on the clock  How many times to the shop  Too many  lets see  its already had to have a recall done on the cruise control  IT WOULDN T SHUT OFF  After that  it had automatic windshield wipers  but not as fancy as the Cadillac Rainsense wipers  these wipers would just come on for no particular reason  This has been happening to lots of these trucks according to the dealer  Transmission problems are normal right  Not three months after you buy a brand new truck  Its been in the shop for other reasons  but they fail my memory right now  Not a reliable truck er car Updated 8 9 So the Ranger got good crash test ratings  How about a real world account  Two more teens I know just purchased 1999 s and 2000 s  which is something I will not stop ridiculing them for  What a stupid choice  Anyways  one of them got a little out of control at highway speeds and ended up totalling the front end of the truck  The airbags did not deploy until she had successfully smashed her nose on the steering wheel  If thats not bad enough  then the airbag deployed and slammed her back  If you even consider purchasing this truck  I will never read another of your articles or consider you a peer  as you are obviously mentally challenged Loading  Good luck  the fold down rear seats fold down so you have to CLIMB OVER THEM Updated 8 9 Four bangers are notorious for good gas mileage right  Not with the Ranger  with this iddy bitty inline four cylinder  I d expect to get at least 40 highway  my friend swore she got thirty miles per gallon  which her particular truck did  but any other owner of a 2 5 liter I4 will report never even touching 20mpg  Now you may say this is ok  I might too  if it was a Vortec 4300 with power  but it is gutless  Its outfitted with a towing package  but if you can find something it ll tow  let me know  You couldn t tow a jetski in this thing with all of the hills on the way to Lake Powell  or into Phoenix for Lake Pleasant Updated  4 25 Rear spring weight is useless  Me and a friend asked her why her rear end was so close to the ground  she replied that she had some cement in the back  No more thought given  I was on my motorcycle and asked her if she could take my backpack home  she agreed This truck does have better payload than a motorcycle  I opened the trunk I mean Tonneau cover  only to discover two bags of 85 lb  cement  Thats not even the weight of the average male  With the rear end sag  I was expecting to see at least seven bags The Tonneau cover looks awesome on this truck  it is very nice that Ford is implementing their trucks with such a cheap accessory to try to make up for more expensive problems   Tonneau is actually a company that makes bed covers  but recently all bed  quot lids quot  have been referred to as  quot Tonneau quot  Snug Top and quite a few other companies make similar products  I believe the cover on my friends car is a Snug Top  the weather stripping has already let go and it feels really flimsy to hold lift up on the handle  Rear gate lifters that are standard in most SUV s for the rear window and or rear gate are all that holds this Tonneau cover up  it seems that a much more effective way could have been implemented The stock rims look pretty nice  but with one minor deficiency  They come apart  Another friend who owns an even crappier 1999 had a rim disintegrate at 45 mph  he is lucky he missed all of the trees  I don t even want to get started on his truck because he has abused it so much its hard to say whether the problems are his fault or Ford s  My other friend is a well mannered girl that is very gentle with her truck b Overall  She did get a pretty good deal on the truck  walking out the door with a brand new semi furnished  barely driven  truck for  12 000 A better idea would have been a Ford Focus Although after reading some reviews  or Chevy Metro  since she d have the same amount of room  better gas mileage  better back seat  generally everything would be better b Alternative  For those looking for a much better truck  a Chevy S 10 with either the 2 2 liter Vortec or 4 3 liter Vortec are recommended by me after lots of research  Especially the 4 3 liter Vortec The 4 0 liter version of this truck  whom another friend owns  is just as fast as the Chevy S 10  But guess what size engine the Chevy has in it  2 2 Liter Vortec  So  for the Chevy you ll pay less  get better gas mileage and be able to keep up with Ford V6 s  Not to mention my friend had to replace his engine at 107 000 miles b Rest in Peace  Update 7 7 00 Well  it is under unfortunate circumstances that I write this update  My friend  whom I ve recently fallen out of friendship with  had a number of problems with her  1999 XLT Ford Ranger SuperCab 2 3 Liter Inline Four Cylinder Automatic   It refused to start on numerous occasions  it was running extremely rough  and the recalls were just too much  It turns out my friend didn t get the warranty I thought she did  They traded this POS in on a 2000 F 150 4 6 Liter V8 with 5 000 miles on it Will they ever learn  The Ranger was trouble from the day it was designed  to the day it was traded in  I feel guilty giving this truck one star  since it doesn t even deserve that b R I P b i Little truck  rest in peace i Born August 1999  Died July 2000 A total of 25 000 gentle miles were placed on this Ford Yet it was just too much  she couldn t handle it She is survived by two sisters  a 1993 3 0 Liter Ranger  a 1996 Dodge Avenger  a mother  a 1989 AeroStar  and has been replaced by a larger  but probably as troublesome F 150 She won t be missed  but won t be forgotten May others learn from her mistakes Who would I recommend this truck for  My worst enemy br br
