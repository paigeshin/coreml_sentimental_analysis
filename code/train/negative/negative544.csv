 I was looking for the best sport utility on the market  and Ford said they had the best  so I went to go look at it  I was pretty impressed for what I saw  When I sat down with the salesperson I couldn t believe all the options the Explorer had  I told the salesperson I wanted power in the engine  but didn t want AWD  They told my option was a new 4 6 OHC engine that had 200 HP compared to the V 8 that had 215HP  After all was said and done  I leased the vehicle for 2 years When I drove the Explorer home I was very impressed  It had the power I wanted  and it drove like a car  Well  this feeling was very short  After a couple of months I felt like I was sitting in the engine compartment  It was so noisy I couldn t hear myself think  On one cold day in November I went outside to start the truck and heard banging coming from under the hood  I couldn t imagine what it was  I drove over to the dealership to see what it was  and the service manager looked at it with two mechanics and still couldn t figure it out  They told me to leave the truck there so they could run some tests  After a week of tests and a recall notice they told me I needed a new cam and the upper portion of the engine the truck only had 4000 miles on it  When I took the truck home it was still noisy in the interior but it drove well  The next year and a half had it s ups and downs  I returned to the dealership 41 more times to fix a bunch of problems  Some of the problems were  the L S R door was getting stuck  it started to burn more fuel then it should have  and it had a whole bunch of recalls If your looking to by a used Ford Explorer make sure you look into the maintenance history  The truck itself is a good truck  but Ford had alot of problems with the 1997 s br br
