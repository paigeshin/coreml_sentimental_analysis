 I bought this vehicle last year because I wanted a professional looking vehicle that I could drive to a construction site  I am an architect  I found this Explorer and thought that this vehicle would be perfect for work and recreation  I definitely thought this was a good looking vehicle  black with dark tinted windows  power windows and locks and the smoothest  most luxurious ride out of the other trucks I have owned  and I have owned quite a few  Things started to go wrong when I learned about the recalls  The truck was recalled for a hood latch  cruise control problems  and then the tires  I was fortunate in that I did not have the recalled Firestone tires  I wanted bigger tires than the ones that came standard with the truck and paid extra for them  I consider myself lucky on that note  As soon as the warranty went out on the truck I started to have more problems  The truck would shake when it was running and I took it in to have it serviced  I paid roughly  600 for exhaust manifold gasket problems  I got it back and as I was leaving the service station  I went to turn the alarm back on from valet mode and the button fell off into the dashboard  Four days later my wife gets stranded at a meeting because the truck would start and stall when she released the gas  Not only was she stranded  but she was angry and embarrassed as well  She was going to lunch with friends and had to be rescued  She doesn t understand why her 5 year old Jeep which has 160 000 miles has never left her stranded and an almost brand new truck with less than one quarter of the mileage has left us stranded three times  The truck was returned for a third time and another  200 later I drove it out of the service station  Thirty minutes later I was stranded again  The truck wouldn t start and it had to be towed  This is where I am now  I HAVE A TRUCK PAYMENT  NO TRUCK  ALMOST  1 000 IN BILLS AND I STILL DON T KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY TRUCK OR HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO FIX IT  I have a brake light that doesn t work  an alarm button that is inside the dashboard and the rear windshield wiper doesn t work as well  All for the small price of  35 000  Where else can you get service like that  but FORD
