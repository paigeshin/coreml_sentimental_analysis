 While I was determining the fate of my  1989 Toyota Camry  a couple of weeks ago  I had the experience of driving a  2000 Ford Focus Sedan  for a week as a rental car from  Accent Rental  The  Ford Focus  which I rented was advertised as a mid sized vehicle  Believe me when I tell you  this vehicle is not mid sized in my personal opinion  The vehicle is small in size on the outside as well as the inside  As many of you may know from reading previous epinions  my oldest son is a big defensive lineman  Somehow  I managed to get him inside this vehicle without him being overly uncomfortable  but overall the entire vehicle was way too small for my tastes  After we put the seat all the way back  there was no way that anyone could sit behind him  even a small child The interior of the  Focus  which I drove was rather cheaply made  Even though the vehicle only had about 19 000 miles on it the seats were showing signs of extreme wear both on the front and back  Being that my own  quot new quot  car has about 1000 more miles than the  Focus  did  the quality of my  Chevrolet Impala s  interior is far superior than the  Focus  While the overall exterior of the  Focus  was very attractive and the trunk space was rather roomy for a car this size  there were two things which I experienced with the performance of this vehicle which gave me a total negative impression of the  Focus b The first thing that I really did not like about the  Ford Focus  is that the air conditioning needed to be a bit cooler in the car  I realize that the week that I had driven this vehicle was one of the hottest in Atlanta s history  and the air quality was horrendous  but I felt that any vehicle that is  quot new quot  on the market should be able to completely fill the vehicle with cool air on demand  I found that I had to continuously run the air conditioning all of the time full blast to get this result Because I had to run the air conditioning in that manner  I encountered the second problem which was more serious  With the air conditioning going full blast  the car had no get up and go  This presented problems when I was going up hills here in our area which are very steep to say the least  The  Focus  had a hard time going up the hills and I had to give the vehicle so much gas that I thought I was going to flood the car  Consequently when the week was up and I had purchased my new  Impala   I was very happy to turn this vehicle in  I prefer to have a vehicle  quot move quot  when I give it the gas and do what I want it to do and the  Focus  performed poorly in that aspect  If you live in an area where there are no hills  this vehicle may work out for you  In my personal opinion though  I believe the car has no get up and go in demanding situations and I do not recommend this vehicle for purchase Features of the  Ford Focus  which I drove included  4 Cylinder  2 0 Liter  110 Horsepower Engine   Automatic Transmission  Good MPG of 27 MPG in the City  35 MPG on the highway  AM FM Cassette Radio Stereo  Power Windows and Locks  Air Conditioning  Adjustable Shoulder Seatbelts br br
