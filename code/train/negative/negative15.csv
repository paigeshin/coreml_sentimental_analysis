 So it is the new fad for mothers to drive  Expeditions  Suburbans  Land Cruisers and now Excursions ok maybe it isnt a NEW fad  The Ford  quot Death Trap quot  Excursion is exactly how it sounds  It is a monster but is it really worth the extra  quot room quot  This thing is an incredible undertaking to drive  you must be constantly aware of everything around you  The truck barely fits within its allotted space  on the right side of the road  Built off of the frame of the F 250 truck  the Excursion has not particularly crash tested well either  I test drove one of these while helping a friend s family pick out a car  I must say that I cannot recommend it  No pickup  not that any is needed  and terrible turning radius  The extra insecurities are simply not worth its size  Whatever happened to the mini van  It s roomier  more comfortable  and more efficient  but it just doesnt seem to be in style anymore  Until then I believe every  quot soccer quot  mom feels its necessary to have a 4wd Expedition  Suburban  or Excursion  When driving the Excursion you will not be worried about your own safety  but those around you instead  Make sure you can handle the ridiculous size before you join in on the large SUV fad Oh yeah and good luck finding a parking spot br br
