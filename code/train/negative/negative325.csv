 We Bought our 1999 Windstar in December of 2000  It had 26 000 miles on it  We bargiend with the dealer and got a 6 year 120K warrenty too  First Impression We liked the Deep Red  Like a good wine  hence the name  Dark Cabernet Red  The interior was nicley appointed  but looked like it was done on the cheap  The tires where also cheap  but I blame that on the dealers replacements  It had a good radio and good a c and comfertably fit a family of 6 Drivetrain The 3 8 V 6 has plenty of get up and go  It gets 17 around towan and 23 on the interstate  The transsmisson usually shifts smothly Handling Fine  It does become a bit hard to handle in an emergancy situation  but its fairly easy to control  The dealer had put Ameri General tires on it  We replaced them with a good set of Dunlops  It brakes ok Interior Cheap  Several small plastic bits fell off and the rear a c control fell out during hard braking  The rear a c worked well  the seats where comfertable for road trips and my family never complained  The CD Cassette delivered pleanty of good rich sound  Reliablity Here is my complaint and why we no longer have this van  Ford doesn t make good trannies and this one was no exception  It was worse than normal  It whent out around 60K  Fortunatly the extended warrenty picked that up  Plus it had numorus electrical issues  the interior was falling apart and it just wasn t well built  I had all the usual Windstar problems  do a little reserch like Car Trackers  and you ll see what I mean  I wouldn t reccomend this to any one
