 Yes this is an odd looking sports utility truck with a rear bed just a little over 4 feet long  The bed is about 2 feet in depth and 4 feet wide by 4 feet in length giving it only about 30 cubic feet in cargo space  After awhile you kind of do get use to the look The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac 4WD that are made after 6 22 2000  base list price is for  24580 00 without the destination charge It comes with a 4 0 liter SOHC V6  Fuel Induction SFI with 205 horsepower and 240 foot pounds of torque  The gas mileage rating is 16 MPG for the City and 19 MPG for the highway with a standard 5 Speed Manual with Overdrive transmission  The Automatic transmission 5 Speed with Overdrive gets 15 MPG for the City and 19 MPG for the highway When I drove it I was disappointed  it road rougher than I expected and it seemed top heavy on cornering  The performance of the V 6 was fair and it run a lot better when we run a premium gas in it The interior looked nice with two front air bags and a nice gauge layout for easy reading  The rear seat wasn t to bad  there was enough room for two adults and one child as long as the front seats were not all the way back  The back seat has three child seat tether anchors I didn t test the air conditioner  Too cold outside  but  the heater worked great b Standard Equipment  Air Conditioning Power Front Disc Brakes and Braking System with F R Anti Lock Four Cup Holders Power Windows and Door Locks A 20 gallon Fuel Tank Oil Pressure  Voltmeter and Tachometer Gauges Power Dual Mirrors AM FM Stereo with CD   Cassette and Digital Clock Intermittent Wipers Three Power Outlets And more b Cons  One thing I did not like is that the engine rattles occasionally using 87 octane  so you need to use a higher octane gas b Warranty  Ford Motor Company gives you 3 years or 36 000 miles Limited Bumper to Bumper and 3 years or 36 000 miles of 24 hr Roadside Assistance  There is a 5 year with Unlimited mileage for Corrosion Perforation b My Final Thoughts  I was really disappointed in this truck  If you want a Ford truck then check out the Ford F 150  it rides and handles a lot better and you can haul more  If you need an SUV get the Ford Explorer  at least you can haul people more comfortably  I had this truck for two days playing with it  I had the 4 x 4 version with the automatic transmission  they also make a 2 wheel drive version  I did not use it off road since it was brand new and not mine Ford makes some good trucks  I was just not impressed with the 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac 4WD
