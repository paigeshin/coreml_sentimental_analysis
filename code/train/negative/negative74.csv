 While my  a href auto review 3C55 AAC6464 38E3EDC5 prod4 1999 BMW 323is a  was being serviced I was given a rental for 24 hours via  a href content 74992291460 Enterprise a  In spite of my previous bad experience  this young man was very nice  Although the situation was much different  and was giving the 4 women ahead of me choices  It appeared no one wanted to drive the  Ford F150   I grabbed it since we are rethinking our configuration of cars and I really don 146t like my husband 146s  a href auto review 6E8 A133239 38F5D3B7 prod6 1998 Chevy S 10 Pick Up a b The car 146s features   This truck is the  2003 4 door SuperCrew XLT 4 Wheel Drive Styleside with an automatic transmission b  It has a 4 6 liter engine with 8 cylinders  This is a powerful  huge truck  The truck has a little more than 14 000 miles on it   Remember it is a rental but in fantastic condition  I will attempt not to compare it with my BMW but I can t promise  I do have our Chevy S 10 in mind  though these trucks are very different as well  The Ford F150 has a 25 gallon gas tank with an estimated  gas mileage  of 14 miles per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway  It has so many features that are standard there aren 146t too many options that I would look for except perhaps heated seats  Standard  not an inclusive list  includes automatic transmission  front independent suspension front stabilizer bar  clock  external temperature display  Which I have on my BMW and really love  low fuel level warning  compass  and trailer wiring cargo tie downs  Which we need because we tow a 21 foot travel trailer  a href content 87725346436 Sun Lite a This truck has a  seating capacity of 6 people b  The front has a 40 60 split bench front seats which mean that the driver 146s seat is separate from the other two seats which are attached  The front driver 146s seat is also a little longer than the rest of the bench  A fantastic feature is  lumbar supports  for both the driver and the passenger via a round lever  It makes a huge difference  One reason I don 146t like the Chevy is because it is so uncomfortable  I found the Ford F150 to be quite comfortable There is cloth upholstery and in the car I am driving it is a soft material and in gray  What I had never seen is the compartment between the driver and the window passenger  If you only have 2 people in the front you can put down a compartment  I can 146t call it an arm rest because it really doesn 146t come out long enough to rest my arm  that holds cups and storage  This truck has quite a bit of  storage  except for the glove compartment  What looks huge is actually tiny once you open it  There is storage on the doors and on the roof for glasses and kleenex  Note though that there is a  bump   It isn 146t huge like in a bucket seat car  where the middle passenger sits  The is so much head and leg room that comfort in the front isn 146t an issue   The back  has cup holders as well and a split bench  It is divided as in 1 3 and 2 3rd  There are two head rests  2 3rds of the back bench fold down but not all the way but enough to get to a place where there is a small holding compartment where the jack is kept  The other 1 3rd seat does the same  There are also rear heating ducts The truck has remote power door locks  power windows  power mirrors  cruise control  front and rear 12volt power outlets  air conditioning  front and rear reading lights  dual illuminating vanity mirrors and a leather wrapped steering wheel  Other specs include Front Head Room  39 8 in  Front Hip Room  59 8 in  Front Shoulder Room  63 7 in  Rear Head Room  39 8 in  Rear Shoulder Room  63 6 in  Rear Hip Room  58 in  Front Leg Room  41 in  Rear Leg Room  36 8 in  from www edmunds com I am driving a white truck  It looks nice in white  Other colors are black  beige  red  burgundy  green  dark green  gray  dark gray  silver and a couple of shades of blue It has an AM FM radio with a cassette player with 4 speakers and 80 watts of stereo output  The radio sounds terrific There are no side airbags  you may want to note  Also please  note  that this truck is high  Luckily it has handles near the 4 doors you can hold onto to lift yourself up  For many  though  the height of this truck will be a problem   How the car handles    The first thing I noticed when driving this truck which did not go away with time were the  bumps  I felt  I think the truck found every bump on the road or made up some on the way  That is a real negative for me because we drive for long periods of time and if we are spending this much money will spend a bit more for a vehicle that will tow and that won 146t get me car sick  The second thing I noticed was the  outside noise b  That seemed to diminish in time  Of course it really didn 146t  I just noticed it less  I could  for example  use my cell phone 146s voice command without being told it was too noisy  The third thing I noticed was that it didn 146t  stop  like my BMW  OK I know I said I wouldn 146t compare  but this is a truck  It stops just like our Chevy a bit too slowly for me  Stepping hard on the brake will stop the truck immediately but just pushing on it will have it come to a slow stop  The fourth thing I noticed was the  steering b  Considering how big this truck is it handles well  It corners much better than I expected  though I did move with the truck  For something this size I didn 146t expect the steering to handle so well  I easily passed cars that I was too close to and got into the lane again with no problem The fifth thing I noticed was the  acceleration b  OK it is a truck but with 8 cylinders I expect more power  I had to really give it gas to get up a hill at 65 miles an hour  I never feared for my life when merging onto the highway  there is enough pickup for me to say it accelerates well enough  I 146m just not used to having to put my foot down on the accelerator so hard to get it going  I could feel it go into gear as I accelerated as well   I could also feel the truck at 70 miles an hour b  I wasn 146t afraid of going to fast in this Ford because it told me when we were above the speed limit  150 it shook a little bit  I had a Maxima that did that and I don 146t like that  We travel in places where there are no speed limits so I 146d like to be able to do 80 without feeling it  The  safety  of this truck is not good according to http www hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html summary lgpickup htm 0110  The overall is poor as is the safety of your chest  head and neck  left foot is acceptable  right is marginal and the restraints  using a dummy  are poor  150 that is they don t keep you safe enough  The standard basic  warranty  including the drivetrain and roadside assistance is 3 years or 36 000 miles  The warranty for rust is 5 years  This is one of the worse warranties I have seen  150 at least comparing it to cars b In summary    I have said many times that if I looked at the crash tests on vehicles I probably wouldn 146t get into one  but these letters  P poor  are glaring  Can I not recommend a truck based on that alone  Perhaps but there are other reasons I can 146t recommend it  I love the lumbar support  though why it is manual I don 146t know when everything is power  Then again in my BMW my seat lever is manual in spite of other things being power  Among the things mentioned  150 the bumps  the noise  the fact that the middle person in the front has a bump under their legs  does that make it a 5 seater then  really  the fact that the acceleration isn 146t what I would like nor is the ability to stop  and the climb up it will get 3 stars since I like it better than my Chevy which I don 146t recommend either  So it is an average truck  I am sure there are better  I love the 4 doors and the 7 000 pound towing capability which is what we need  but other than that  I know I 146ll look elsewhere If you have any questions about this car  feel free
