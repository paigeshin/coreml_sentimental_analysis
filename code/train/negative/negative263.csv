 I purchased a 1996 Ford Probe in May of 1997  It was brand new with only 15 miles on it when we got it  Very clean  very sporty  It was my first new car purchase ever  I thought I had the perfect car  WRONG  After only a month the A C went out  And in Texas summers an A C is a given  We took it in and discovered that our dealer wouldn t give us a loaner  even though it was only a month old  Eventually I got one anyway  The fixed the problem and we were on our way  A month went by and the same thing happened again  Again we got it fixed  This continued to happen at least 4 times over the next year or so  On top of the A C problems the brakes wore out after 25 000 miles  The tires were shot around 30 000 miles  The seats tore up  And the gas mileage was so so  When you drive down the rode it seems as if you are in a wind tunnel or something  And when it rained outside it usually rained in on us  Needless to say  after about 60 000 miles we traded it in just as the transmission was fixing to go out on it  By the way  to get a transmission fixed you have to fork out about 2500 bucks  And that will be a normal cost for about every 30 000 miles after that  Stay away from this and any other Ford if you can br br
