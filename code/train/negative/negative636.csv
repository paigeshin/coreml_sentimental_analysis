 Preface In August 1998  I was driving my one month old Pontiac Grand Prix GTP Daytona 500 Pace Car  please read my review on that  when some bozo in a Honda Accord pulled out in front of me  I was NOT happy  Nobody was hurt seriously  I broke his car literally in two  His insurance paid for the  12 000 repair to the front end of my limited edition car  I ll bet they were really happy with him  His insurance also paid for a rental while my car was in the shop  from September 2 to December 15   no joke  This rental car I had was a 1998 Ford Taurus The Taurus Since I had this car for 3 and a half months  I feel kind of like I owned it  Here is what I thought of it The Good What good can I say about this car  Well  for starters  it was fairly comfortable  at least in the 60 40 driver s seat  I say fairly  because even though I ve been much more comfortable in a car  I never got sore during my 35 minute commute each way every day  The wheel and controls were comfortable as well  The gas mileage was pretty good  It was a fairly quiet car  too   pretty solid  and not a lot of wind noise  That surprised me  The car was also easy to maneuver  Not bad for a low end family sedan The Bad I didn t  want  a low end family sedan  I wanted my 240hp loaded out road rocket back  So I always compared it to my car which was slowly coming back together in the shop  In that aspect  the Taurus  weaknesses become very apparent  It is quite weak  That s probably why there s so little wind noise    My Taurus accelerated like a small 4 cylinder despite the fact that it was a 6 cylinder  This was a problem more than once merging on the highway  Even worse   in fact  the  worst  problem I had with this car   was the rear visibility  Three times I almost hit a car coming up on my left  I never rely on mirrors  I always turn my head to look over my shoulder before changing lanes  When I turned my head to look back over my left shoulder  all I could see was the window post  The visibility was terrible  and I advise anyone who has one of these cars to be extra careful when changing lanes  Furthermore  I just didn t care for the styling  The ovoid theme was carried WAY too far  making this car look just as ridiculous inside as outside  The oval radio console must make upgrading the stereo a nightmare  The oval inside door handles were very flimsy The Verdict If you re used to well equipped fast cars  you won t like this one  It ain t  If you re looking for a comfortable family sedan for a fairly inexpensive price  you might want to check it out Oh yeah  and those of you who have Taurus SHOs and think they are fast  well okay  Maybe  That s not what I reviewed  Besides  my GTP will make an SHO look like it s standing still   br br
