 Sport and Sport Trac carry on for 2003 with some safety and equipment revisions to their 1995 vintage Explorer design  the more popular Explorer 4 dr wagon was redesigned last year  see separate entry  Sport is a 2 dr wagon  Sport Trac has a 4 dr SUV cabin  but gets a 4 ft long pickup truck bed in lieu of an enclosed cargo area  Both use a V6 engine with manual or 5 speed automatic transmission  They offer rear wheel drive or Ford s ControlTrac 4WD that can be left engaged on dry pavement and includes low range gearing  ABS is standard  For  03  Sport Trac gets the 4 wheel disc brakes already standard on Sport  Sport Trac is also due for optional curtain side airbags later in the model year  Sport loses its optional front side airbags  Newly available on both models are heated front seats  and during the year Sport Trac is expected to add an option package with a high end sound system and special wheels New to the class this year  Honda Pilot has taken the lead as a Best Buy  It offers ample cargo space  seating for eight passengers  all wheel drive with a locking rear differential for added traction  and above average refinement  Toyota Highlander is our other Best Buy  chosen for its on road competence  convenience  and attractive pricing and design Year to year sales for the three model Explorer line Sport 2 dr  Sport Trac pickup and 4 dr wagon dipped 6 6 percent in calendar 2001  a decent showing given the year s turbulent events  First half 2002 sales were down a nomimal 0 7 percent vs  the year earlier period  also not bad under the circumstances  The mainstay 4 door wagon got off to a slow start  but the factors working against it apparently have less effect on demand for the two Sport models Acceleration  V6 provides good off the line power and fine around town response  feeling overtaxed only in highway passing or on mountain upgrades Fuel Economy  Test Sport and Sport Trac models averaged 15 16 mpg in our tests  about par for a 6 cyl midsize SUV  Ford recommends 87 octane fuel Ride Quality  Sport Trac has a longer wheelbase than the Sport  and a far better ride  though it s still unforgiving over sharp bumps  especially the 4WD model  Sport has a bouncy  unpleasant ride on most any surface Steering Handling Braking  Sport Trac has more accurate steering and takes corners with slightly less body lean than Sport  though both handle with reasonable balance and confidence Quietness  Not car quiet  but not excessively loud for a truck based wagon  though tire and wind noise rise markedly with speed Instruments Controls Interior Materials  Straightforward and logical  but a mild stretch to climate controls  Power window switches are illuminated  Sport Trac s novel back window powers up and down at touch of dashboard button great for ventilation  Materials range from serviceable to leather fancy  workmanship is solid Room Comfort Driver Seating  front  Step in height is slightly taller than SUV norm  but there s plenty of room and a comfortable driving position Room Comfort  rear  Sport Trac s rear seat is roomier than that of any compact crew cab pickup  There s ample space for two adults  and three can squeeze in  Sport s 2 dr body makes getting in and out a real chore  and for cramped accommodations once aboard  Seat in both models is hard and lacks much shoulder support Cargo Room  Good in cabin storage  and both models  split rear seatback folds in single motion without removing the headrests  Sport has ample cargo room and separate opening liftglass  For Sport Trac  we recommend the optional bed extender that effectively lengthens the bed about 2 ft  Both models have undercarriage spare tire storage Value within Class  The uncomfortable 2 dr Sport is of limited appeal  while the Sport Trac has a deserved following based on its unique blend of passenger space and open bed versatility
