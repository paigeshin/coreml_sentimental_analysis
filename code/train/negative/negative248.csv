 This was the worst car I have ever owned  Literally as the odometer rolled past 80 000  The fuel pump  tranmission  distributor cap  spark plug wires  CV axles  both  all went out  Sure you are thinking this idiot never even changed the oil  WRONG I know the importance of routine maintenance  This car couldn t hold up to regualr weart and tear  this must be why the Odometer has only 5 dgits on it it won t make it to six  I know the car was never intended to be built like a tank that s why it costs as little as it does  however everything is made of cheap plastic  lacking any quality and value to the owner  Also if you are even near 6 feet tall you will not fit in this car  front or back seat
