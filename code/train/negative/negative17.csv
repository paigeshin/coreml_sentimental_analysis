 I am going to start this off by telling you that I hate big cars  They guzzle gas like nobody s business  This one is in the 10 mpg range  They are a danger to anyone not in them on the road  and  despite their ludicrous size  they never have any room for their passengers  Ford s new Excursion is the worst of them all  This monstrosity is like something out of a horror film  When I see it on the road I expect it to start roaring and try to run me over  Seriously though  I feel like there is a genuine risk to my life when I am driving near an Excursion  and they are a horrible risk to the environment as well br br
