 The Ford Expedition is supposed to be a top of the notch vehicle  however  there are many little things that just bring down the whole vehicle  First of all there is no trunk space  If you have a car that is made to hold 8 people  there needs to be room to put all of their things  My family got the car because we have 6 people all of whom are involved in soccer  We need the large car to travel to our soccer games and tournaments  There is never room to put all of our bags  Another problem is that when the seats are put down  they don t align properly  On long trips  it is so nice to be able to put down the seats and make it into a bed  But since the seats are uneven  the bed is very uncomfortable  Another problem that just irks me is the windows  The back windows don t go down all the way  They go too low to be for child safety  You can t put your arms out of the window and they get an annoying dirt line on them that is hard to get rid of  If you haven t noticed I m speaking from the passengers point of view  But I have also driven it many times  The seats are rather hard and uncomfortable  I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee which has extremely comfortable seats and the transition to the Expedition is not a good one  The Expedition does drive nicely  It shifts very smoothly  It has average gas mileage and is relatively smooth riding   Except once when it hydroplaned on the interstate not good at all  All together I would not recommend the Expedition  If you are buying as a car that you would like to be comfortable for your passengers  as I assume you are since you are buying a car made for eight  I would recommend something more like a Suburban br br
