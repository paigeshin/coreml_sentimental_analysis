 I purchased this vehicle brand new in 1998  when it had about 40 miles on it  It was in the shop within the first week  with rattling noises coming from under the hood and the emergency brake light wouldn t go off  Just recently  I was rear ended at a stop sign  The rear bumper of my Escort was completely totalled  and there was damage to the frame of the car as well  The person that hit me suffered only a broken headlight  She probably hit me at about 20 mph  but her car miraculously did not sustain the kind of damage as my Escort did  For the external damages  repair estimates are  700  They haven t taken the car apart yet to determine the estimate to repair the frame of the car  You would think that a car could handle a crash of this speed without too much damage  but it wasn t the case  The body of the car was found to be pretty weak in this kind of crash  Suffice it to say  I will not be purchasing another Escort  I don t feel safe in it at all UPDATE  This crash was at 15 mph  and the damage ended up costing over  1 000  Thankfully the other driver was insured and I didn t have to pay for it
