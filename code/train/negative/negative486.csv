 You may have read my initial review of the 2001 Focus ZX3 where I lauded the car s impressive features for the price  impressive handling  styling and comfort  To say I am  dissappointed  Six months and 7 000 miles into my ownership experience  is a gross understatement This vehicle has spent 16 days in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problems   5spd manual  The dealership initially insisted that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not duplicate my complaint  After doing exhaustive internet research  I found that the transmission problem affects ALMOST EVERY Focus with the 5 speed manual  I also found that although Ford initially denied there was any such problem  the company has recently issued a service bulletin regarding  gear rollover noise Gear rollover causes a distinct chattering from the transmission  The car sounds like an old diesel engine  There is no doubt that the noise will substantially impair the trade or resale value of this car and it suggests that a more serious transmission problem is yet to come  Ford says the noise is  normal  Gas consumption is MUCH less than Ford claims under all driving conditions The engine loses RPM and stumbles  as if it s going to stall  at almost every traffic light  My dealer has been unable to fix the stumble There is a noise coming form the cargo area which sounds like a mechanic left a wrench or something inside the body I am filing for the lemon law hearing this week  I highly suggest you run a word search in the USENET archives and check out the problems people are reporting with their Focus
