  NOTE read this part of the review first then read the update  My opinion of this vehicle changed considerably over the year and a half we owned it  Thanks When my husband and I were starting our search for a new vehicle  we had several issues we needed to address  First and foremost  we wanted a 4 door vehicle  Second  we needed something with a decent cargo area because of my husband s sales job  Everything was steering us towards a mini van until we spotted a Ford Sport Trac it was love at first sight We test drove one at a local dealership and got all the specifics on it  Originally we were going to order one  but held off and our patience paid off when we came across a dealer demo that had all of the options we wanted  and a few we could have cared less about  We purchased the Sport Trac at the beginning of July and already we have over 7000 miles on it The model we purchased is a two wheel drive with the limited slip axle  6 Cyl  cloth interior and the option packages that include the leather steering wheel cover  fog lights  tow bars  16  wheels  cruise control  and the compass thermometer gauges   I m not going to list the option packages because they keep changing them  Ours also came with the cargo cage  something I wouldn t have purchased had it not been included with this one  but have used quite a bit  For those who don t know  this vehicle comes equipped with air conditioning  power door locks and windows and a single CD player radio  At the time we purchased ours  it was only available with an automatic transmission  Ours is Toreador Red and also has the running boards  Because we bought a demo  we got a nice chunk of cash knocked off the price  but since it was under a certain mileage amount  it still classified as a new vehicle Driving the Sport Trac is a very pleasant experience  while it doesn t drive like any car I ve driven  it also doesn t drive like a truck either  somewhere in between  Handling is very responsive with a minimal roll on corners  Even so  it has taken a bit of adjusting for me since I m used to driving Honda Civics  Braking is a bit soft to me  but that also may be due to the difference in the size of the vehicle  The automatic transmission seems to shift easily and has the overdrive option which can be turned off and on with the click of a switch  It rides very smoothly and from what I ve been told  if we switch to passenger tires instead of off road tires when we replace them  that will improve even more  Acceleration is very good  passing is a breeze on a flat area and climbing hills isn t an effort The interior is probably my favorite part of the whole vehicle  The two front seats are incredibly comfortable  I suffer from low back problems and these seats have been a god send  The drivers seat has the power adjustments which come in handy since my husband and I don t sit the same way when we drive and we can change it quickly  The rear seat is very roomy  one of my pet peeves with most of the popular SUV s is the  knees up the nose  scenario for anyone with long legs sitting in the back  I can easily sit in the back seat  I m 5 7  mostly legs  facing forward and not have my knees even touch the seat in front of me  It also has a 60 40 split for folding down and makes a very flat surface for carrying things you wouldn t want on the seats or in the bed  There are plenty of cup holders in this particular one as well  two up front and two in the back  guess person number 5 is out of luck  The cloth interior vacuums easily and I love the fact that you can take the berber type carpet completely out for thorough cleaning with two furry dogs it will come in very handy  There is also this neat little cargo compartment between the seats that is removable if you need to carry something valuable with you Interior noise is a little more than I would like but nothing you can t drown out with the stereo  I ve noticed quite a bit of wind noise around the windows  not sure if it s because the windows don t seal as tightly as they should  or an aerodynamic design flaw  One major plus though is the rear sliding window it can be opened several inches with the touch of a button or put down the whole way  Even opened just a few inches creates air circulation sufficient to cool it off on a hot day and it keeps the noise to a minimum  far better than driving with the driver or passenger window cracked  I ve never been a big fan of cruise control  but this one is very easy to use and operates very efficiently  All of the other controls are easy to reach too and take a minimum of know how to use with the exception of the windshield wipers  I think there are just a few too many notches in the intermitent section  just how many different speeds do you really need  In addition to the cigarette lighter outlet  they have added an extra one  something which is becoming more of a standard feature now in most cars but for the true sportsman  there is yet another in the bed of the truck for use with various camping sporting equipment  The sound system is very good while ours is only a single CD player  you can get a 6 CD changer with one of the other option packages  It is a very easy to use CD player radio and the sound quality is excellent for a stock stereo  With two speakers in the front and two speakers in the back  you can enjoy anything from a Strauss waltz to Metallica without having to change a lot of settings for maximum sound quality  I do wish they had included a cassette with this package for some of us who don t have everything on CD   apparently they have since changed this Exterior is actually very simple  not a lot of flash or trim and washes up very easily  While the bed is smaller than most pick ups  it is generally large enough to hold most things an average family needs to haul and with the cargo cage it adds quite a bit of space to it  We used ours to help friends move and got an amazing amount of stuff in the back as well as in the rear seat with it folded down  One big plus with the cargo cage is when it s flipped into the bed  it makes a nice secured space for hauling smaller items so they don t slide all over the bed  My only concern with this bed is that it s made out of this  mysterious composite material I am hoping it holds up with the elements and use Okay  on to the things I don t like  The biggest annoyance to me is that Ford has made it impossible to pick and choose what you want in the options department  If you want one thing  you generally end up with two or three other things you don t want and pay an over inflated price for it  A good example of this is if you did want cruise control you can only get it if you purchase the Convenience Group and also end up with a leather wrapped steering wheel  big deal  auto lock relock  which I hate with a passion  and the remote keyless entry with keypad  a nice feature for the person eternally locking their keys in the car  I guess from an assembly line point of view this is a great idea but for the money conscious consumer  it isn t My other big complaint is the crappy gas mileage  Ours averages between 18 and 22  depending on where we drive it and how far but apparently this issue is being addressed with SUV s in general by the government  so hopefully future SUV purchasers will fair better  A tip for any potential buyers thinking of ordering if you are considering the Estate Green  PLEASE go to a dealership and ask to see another vehicle painted in this color  Apparently the guy setting up the color charts is color blind  the real shade looks NOTHING like the brochure or any of the photos I ve seen of it  Thank heavens we saw one or we might have been stuck with a truck in a color we didn t like Overall we are very pleased with our purchase  I will be very curious to see how it drives a few years from now and if we have any problems with it  Before purchasing it we spoke to several regular Explorer owners who had nothing but praise for them I m hoping we are as fortunate UPDATE 05 03 02 I have changed my rating of the Sport Trac by lowering it one star and actually considered two  We no longer own this vehicle because of continued problems and poor customer service from not one  but two Ford dealerships as well as Ford Motor Company itself  In the year and a half we owned it  we had 3 recalls  had to have the wheel bearings repacked  something I ve never had to have done on ANY other vehicle I ve ever owned  and then to top it off  had problems with it not wanting to start  I don t enjoy being stranded someplace  so I had it looked in to  only to find that the idle sensor had to be replaced  The last straw for us was when we took it in for a 30 000 mile check up  We are in the habit of having the oil changed in our vehicles every 3000   4000 miles and when we took it in when it was right around 4000 miles  THEY DIDN T CHANGE THE OIL  What annoyed us even more was that they claimed it didn t need changed  I m sorry  but oil with 4000 miles of driving time is going to show some wear and it s part of the required maintenance at 30 000 miles  We got in to it with the dealership who couldn t even understand why we were upset  so we decided to file a complaint with Ford only to have some snippy customer service rep  I use that term loosely  tell us that they hadn t done anything wrong  When we asked her who would pay for a blown engine if it happened because the oil hadn t been changed  she couldn t answer our question  She was rude  and when my husband got a little bit huffy with her  her response to him was  there you go with that attitude again  EXCUSE ME  What ever happened to customer service  Apparently Ford doesn t know anything about it  Needless to say  within two weeks the vehicle was gone  we traded it in on a brand new  2002 Honda Accord  I will never buy another Ford again and I won t recommend them to my friends  They don t know a thing about craftsmanship or customer service  and for that kind of money I think I should at least get one or the other in this instance I got neither  I don t make a habit of getting rid of vehicles this quickly  but I could see this was one that would be going nowhere  literally as well as figuratively  fast
