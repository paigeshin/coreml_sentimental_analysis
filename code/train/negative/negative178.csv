 We bought a Ford Taurus a few years ago it was a 91  We bought it because it fit our family  Well when we bought it we had to replace the transmission and the paint on the hood was chipped  Now it is 2000 and it is already needing another transmission and the paint is really chipped off of the hood  The check engine light is always coming on and it stalls out on you  We have put so much money in this car  I am afraid to buy another ford taurus thinking that it will have the same problem after a few years br br
