 What a terrible vehicle for such a price  This vehicle had nothing  but flaws and defects  It came delivered with dry ball joints  a twisted brake line  defective door gaskets  a bad door latch  rattles in the dashboard  It was in the shop more times than not and the service department could never fix it right  They were only good at making excuses for it  Then of course  the truck gained a terrible vibration at 46K miles that couldn t be resolved  either  The tranny became noisy at 10K miles  The 4 6L motor is truly an embarassment  significantly underpowered  This vehicle couldn t even climb some highway inclines without downshifting and significantly winding out the engine  Who would ever have thought that someday one would have to pay  30K or more for a Ford
