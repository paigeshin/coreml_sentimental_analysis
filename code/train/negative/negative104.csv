 I inherited BOB T  named by my brother stands for big old brown truck  for my birthday 4 months ago  I paid a symbolic  1500  and while I love it  I m ready to sell it I d always wanted an SUV after a few years of driving my teeny tiny Toyota Tercel  so I was thrilled to get my brother s Explorer  When I got it  it had just over 101k miles on it  At first I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the seats were and with all the nifty little places to store stuff  like under the front arm rest  I was even more delighted to see that my gas mileage was much better than expected  I get about 20 23 mpg in the city and about 25 on the highway  The acceleration is pretty darn good  I oftentimes beat sporty little cars out of stoplights  Once the initial delight wore off  that s when the problems started  Now I understand that my BOB T is 11 years old  but my brother took care of it well  so I didn t expect to be shelling out this kind of money  About 3 weeks after I got the truck  I had to replace the tranny  nice lil dent in my wallet  All seemed well for a week  but it started slipping again  I took it back to the dealership  and they fixed that problem to the tune of  575  About 2 weeks later  the brakes went out on me  Back to the dealership and had the brakes replaced  my wallet is taking a serious beating by now  The brakes haven t worked properly since then  and no dealership or mechanic has been able to fix the issue Just two weeks ago  I was driving down a busy street parkway and the brakes went out on me again  This time  I couldn t pump the brakes to get this behemoth vehicle to stop  I ended up losing control and hitting a guardrail  I didn t do any serious damage to myself or the truck  thank God  But to add insult to injury  as I was creeping back home from my little accident  the tranny slipped severely and I almost ran into the back of an ice cream truck  At that point  I just had the thing towed to the dealership and told them that it was now their problem  They  fixed  the braked and the tranny again this time to the tune of  2400  my wallet can t take much more of this torture  The last time I drove the truck was 4 days ago when I brought it home from the dealership  I m a little scared to drive it I kind of look at it as a deathtrap now  So now it s a very nice driveway decoration  Although I ve had some serious mechanical issues  I love this Explorer because it can haul some major stuff  I was able to haul all of my stuff home from college in one trip  that s nothing to sneeze at considering I had everything but the kitchen sink in my dorm room  I love the feeling of being up higher than everyone else  and it s a great vehicle to take on camping trips with a whole bunch of friends My best advice  you want an SUV  buy it new that way the warranty should take care of most any mechanical issue you can have  These are great vehicles  but older SUV s like mine are best left for off roading and camping  not your everyday commute
