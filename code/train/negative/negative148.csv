 This van was in the shop 7 times in the first 6 months that I owned it The engine would stall and then it would not restart  This happened once to me on the highway doing 120 kph  70 mph  Very very scary First the dealer told me that there was nothing wrong with it  The second time they claimed it was the O2 sensor  The third time they said it was the computer and they reprogrammed it  The fourth time they replaced the computer  The fifth time they replaced the throttle body and it finally seemed to cure the stalling All of this was done under warranty  but it was extremely inconvenient  In addition  I lost all confidence in the vehicle and ended up driving it in the slow lane  etc  in case it stalled out again  Ford refused to replace the vehicle The van has also had 2 tie rods replaced on separate occasions as well  This is on a vehicle with less than 60 000 kms   40 000 miles  on it  It was also in the shop to fix the cruise control as well  Finally  I was stranded again with an under the hood fuel leak Other highs and lows Rear seat removal is easy  but the seat is very heavy  Definitely a two person operation  The rear seat moves forward about 6 inches  which adds a bit of extra luggage space  It folds down as well  which is useful  because removing the seat is such a pain The factory roof rack is flimsy  with a very low load capacity I have the rear air option  We only use it to cool the van down after it has been sitting in the summer sun  Otherwise it can be almost too powerful  In the winter  there is no rear temperature control   we usually turn off the rear heat because it gets too hot We never use the tilting driver s seat for access to the rear seats  To allow for this feature  the driver s door is extra long  which makes it awkward in parking lots Front seats and the optional mid row captains chairs are comfortable  but I find the rear seat too hard and flat The engine has lots of low end torque  but runs out of steam as revs rise  The transmission is fine on upshifts  but can be hard on downshifts  The transmission is geared for relaxed cruising  Engine revs at 70 mph are around 2400 rpm  This makes for a relaxed ride  but ensures the need for a noisy downshift when passing The sliding side door rolls more smoothly and is easier for kids to close than some other mini van doors Sound insulation and ride is okay  There is an optional kiddie convex shaped mirror  which really helps to keep track on what the kids are doing in the back There is an optional control for the radio for the rear passengers  which can be good or bad depending upon what your kids like to listen to I also got the optional center console  which has a handy power outlet  The console adds lots of storage space  but makes access to the rear seats from the interior a little difficult  The power outlet in the console is always on  even when the key is out of the ignition  which is handy  I also got the optional power outlet for the center row seats  which is useful for the kids There is a door lock switch in the back hatch area which is handy The bolt cover for the optional alloy wheels is huge  It covers 1 3 of the wheel  which is ridiculous  considering that I spent the extra   for the alloy  not for plastic
