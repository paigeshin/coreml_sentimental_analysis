 I bought mine for the same reasons other people bought theirs  Good driving manners and good looks  lots of room and easy to get into  and of course the price 10 000 miles later I have traded it  1  two recalls so far and a third on the NHSTA website concerning the frame  2 windshield distorted and scratched 3 wind noise and tire noise unbearable 4 overdrive switch didn t work  5  three times to fix wet floorboards  windshield leaking and air conditioner case leaking into cabin  still not fixed when I traded it I also have data from other people in my area who bought a focus around the same time  and have had similar and worse problems  Especially the wet floor  which I have seen for myself  I called Ford corporate and they say they are still working on the air conditioner problem  no solution yet And finally finding out what it is really worth  when I tried to trade it at other dealers who knew about the problems  The only place I could get a decent deal was at the same ford dealer who sold the focus  I bought a tried and true ranger truck  life goes on br br
