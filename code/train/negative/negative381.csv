 I bought a used 1993 Ford Taurus in 1997  with about 50K miles on it  From the beginning this car was a black hole with my hard earned money  I spent almost  7000 on this car  and have put almost  3000 into it since  NOT including gasoline  oil changes  or regular maintenance  First it was the neutral positioning sensor that left me stranded on the side of the highway  That cost  180 for one part and 10 minutes of my mechanics time  Then the alternator belt popped off  again leaving me on the side of the road  with about  200 in repairs  Then  it was the radiator  the air condtioning compressor  the fuel pump  and some various gaskets  About 6 months after all those repairs  the spindle assembly in the front left wheel literally flew off my car while I was driving it  I ended up in a ditch  quite shaken up  but very luckily  unharmed  That cost  120 FROM A JUNKYARD NOT THE DEALERSHIP  The dealership wanted  445 for that work  Then  the rack went out along with the power steering pump  and the CV joints  Another  800  I found out from my mechanic that my car was built on a Friday  and that explains a lot  I say I wasted a lot of time and money on this hunk of junk and advise anybody out to buy a 1993 or same model Taurus  keep looking elsewhere  Perhaps I happened to get a bad one out of all of them  but I doubt it  I wish more than anything I could turn back time and NOT buy a Ford Taurus  Buyer beware  Now I have a piece of crud that won t even get me  1000 to put towards another car
