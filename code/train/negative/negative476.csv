  Fine  I ll just go buy something bigger and nicer  Thats what I told the Toyota salesman a year and a half ago when we couldn t strike even close to the deal we wanted on a Sienna minivan  We had a Ford Windstar that was nothing but problems so I was hesitant to buy anymore Ford products  However  with a bad experience at a bad Toyota dealership  we went back to the local Ford lot to look   I don t think all Toyota dealerships are bad  you can see my review on my new 2003 Toyota Sienna  The salesman recommended that we look at SUVs as opposed to minivans since they tend to hold far better value than minivans  Majestically sitting on the front row was a good looking 1999 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition  I ll have to admit these vehicles are eye catchers  As we soon found out  with eye catchers  reality sometimes gets tossed out the window  We struck a lease deal and soon headed out on a long road trip that very evening  Thats when I soon realized what I had done              1 Problem    Gas Mileage  On the highway with cruise control on 65 and no major hills  you can get a whopping 19 MPG  Keep in mind  I m a Republican  but even those kinds of gas mileage upset me and my pocketbook   2 Problem    Control  The vehicle handles very awkwardly in curves and in situations requiring quick response  I often found myself trying to overcompensate for bad timing in curves 3 Problem    Cabin Design  Folks  this is one of the biggest vehicles on the road  therefore  there must be plenty of leg room and cargo space right  WRONG  The third row seat is made for munchkins  Seriously  Very minimal leg room back there  So then you say   Oh  That must be to make up for the cargo room behind the third seat  right  Wrong again  We have to sit our folded stroller vertically to make it fit  and then you sort of have to  slam  the door to get the stroller to push against the back seat so the door will close  Big disappointment 4 Problem    You get to know your service department personnel by name  We owned the vehicle for approximately 16 months and had approximately  800 in repairs over 4 separate incidents  Good thing I purchased an extended warranty   5 Problem    DEPRECIATION  We leased the vehicle based on a  24 900 base price  When we went to trade it in 16 months later the best trade in we got was  16 500  And that was a high offer from the dealership we bought it from because they knew the vehicle and had serviced it  many times  I m really glad I didn t pay the new sticker price of  40 000 plus Just so you don t think I m solely a complainer  I will share with you some of the good things 1   Beautiful exterior with nice paint  Definitely one of the best looking vehicles on the road 2   5 4L V8 Triton Engine has lots of power and can handle any load you put on it  Definitely would be great to pull campers with 3   Leather seats are tough and durable even with small kids   4   Probably the best factory sound system I ve ever heard  Beats most aftermarket stuff 5   Climate control and rear air make the cabin comfortable for all passengers To sum it up  I was more disappointed with this  40 000 vehicle than I was pleased  I m very glad to be the owner of a new 2003 Toyota Sienna  Our family rides much more comfortably now  If you still decide you want one of these monsters  I highly recommend an extended warranty  Good luck on your new purchase
