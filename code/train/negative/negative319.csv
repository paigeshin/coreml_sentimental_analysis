 When I went on vacation with my girlfriend and her family to Washington DC  from Milwaukee  they rented a Ford Winstar to drive there  Well  that was a huge mistake First of all  the minivan is really crampt  There were five of us and we were all squished together  There is no leg room and the trunk area is pretty small  There is a ton of wasted space up by the dash board and the seats are smaller so they could put in drink holders  Once we got on the road  we found out how loud the van was  I sat in the back of the van and I could not even talk to the person in the front because the car was so loud  There were two main sources of noise  the road and the vents  The vents are on the ceiling and let out this loud hissing noise whenever they are on  Also  we couldn t listen to the radio because there no speakers in the back and we couldn t hear the front speakers over all of the other noise The engine  I think it was a V 6  was underpowered and took a lot to accelerate  The van drove like a tank and did not have many extra features  Also  for a new van  the air conditioning barely worked  Overall  I was really disappointed in the car  but I have come to expect that from Ford  I will never rent a Ford car or van again br br
