 I recently had to rent a car to carry a bit more stuff than I could get on the back of my bike  Harper Rental  in Hilo  Hawai i  assigned me a 2003 Ford Focus sedan with 8 365 miles on it  When I rode over to pick it up  and first saw the car  I thought   Gee  That s kinda pretty  I won t mind driving that around  Well  it was nice in the PARKING LOT  I was very grateful for the nice water tight windows  and the heater air con  But once I had loaded my amp a Fender Accoustisonic Jr  not terribly big or heavy  a couple of small drums  other percussion  and my costumes  I had to pretty much floor the gutless wonder to make the speed limit going up the Volcano Highway  This made me think it would probably be a lousy family car  unless you just tool around town and use it for grocery runs so it doesn t have to work very hard  Mashing the accelerator to stay with traffic sucked the gas down  so I lost any fuel savings associated with such a lightweight car  Acceleration was sluggish  so I was unable to pass any of the heavy equipment or horse trailers  which were averaging about 50 mph  This made me really wonder what it would have been like with four adults sitting in it  No idea what kind of engine was in it  but whatever it was  the exercise wheel could have used an extra mouse  or even an upgrade to a mouse or a gerbil  Perhaps adding a rubber band auxiliary engine would have helped  Hmmmmmm      Guess I wasn t at all impressed with the powerplant  Handling was pretty decent  though  On the return home  making the downhill run  the car had no problems staying with traffic  and handled quite well  Nice and tight steering  excellent cornering capability  comfy seating  At 5 3  tall  when I stand up reeeeeaaaaalllly straight  I found the leg and head room to be fine  I did bump my head once when I was squirming around trying to adjust the seat  so my 6  Sweetheart may not have been as comfy  While the trunk CAPACITY was excellent  I found the high lip on the trunk painfully inconvenient  Lifting all of my gear that high was very hard on my back and shoulders  I almost couldn t get the heavier stuff into the trunk  and getting it back out was worse  I did like how far forward the load can sit  so the tail doesn t overload and lighten the front end
