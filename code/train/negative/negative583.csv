 Three years ago  I finally could offer my own brand new car  Coming from France  I wanted something I could not find there  something typically American  I looked at the new Sebring and found it a little expensive and very heavy  I was not that impressed  plus it looked like a car designed for older people  So I thought I would go for the Myth  The So worldwide famous Ford Mustang  I Was so excited by the purchase experience and the fact I was going to own a brand new car that I did not realize how bad this car was for me After a few months of driving  the excitement of driving a new Mustang was gone and reality struck  The Ford Mustang cannot seat four people  so why bother with the rear seats  Unless you put kids in the back  kids up to 11 or 12 top  my 11 YEAR old  a little tall for her age  was not even comfortable in the rear seat  Well  the truth is the Mustang can barely seat two if the front occupants are big or just tall  I am 6 2 quot  and over 200 lbs  I drove   I sold that car after 2 years even though it was paid off with the steering wheel sitting on my lap  my left knee stuck between the turning signal and the door  My legs would start hurting after a couple of hours of driving due to the lack of leg room and the uncomfortable seats which were also too short too support the top part of my legs  A tall person would also find the passenger side uncomfortable because of the seat itself and the lack of  quot knee quot  room  the dashboard above the glove compartment is extended toward the passenger to an extreme  This significantly affects the leg room which would otherwise be decent for this type of car Next disappointent was the engine  or more exactly its lack of power for such an heavy car which brings me to the next flaw of this SO CALLED sport car  it weight  How can you call that a sport car  155 horse power that do not deliver in spite of a pretty big engine 3 8liter  A European or Japanese car equipped with such a big engine would deliver twice that power and be a lot more efficient  Or they would only need a 2 0l to 2 4l to deliver 155 hp on a car 40  lighter  A sport car should not be that heavy  the weight affects the handling and decrease pick up  I had small pick ups totally blew me away at red lights  How embarrassing  The Camaro six cylinder does better wit a more powerful engine I love the shape of the Mustang even though it is too high and massive for a sport car  The quality is better than i expected and it is loaded  What a value  can t beat the price for a car equipped with CD player  power doors  mirrors  remote entry  rear defrost  etc  However  I think all cars should come with floor mats  it is ridiculous to make them an option Another plus for this compact 2 door not so sporty car is the size of the trunk  HOWEVER  the opening is tiny so don t even think about loading any big items  The ride is acceptable at low speed  but becomes unsafe when taking curves a little fast or driving on a rainy day  This car rear end wants to get ahead of the front end  So get used to it before playing the race car driver If you want the sport look at a low price without the power  it might be the car for you if you are single  No family in that car br br
