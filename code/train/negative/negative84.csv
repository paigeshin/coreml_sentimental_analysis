 My 1995 Ford Explorer Sport was my favorite vehicle that I ve owned  when it was running  The things that I liked about this SUV is that it is very roomy and handles very well  These are about the only things that I liked  Every month I had a problem with it  everywhere from that cooling system to the transmition  Nothing but problems  Not only was it always broken down but it also was terrible on the gas mileage  The two other cars that I have had for an extended period of time were a Toyota pickup and the car I have now is an Altima  I haven t had a problem with either of these vehicles  notice that they are both foriegn cars  I would not encourage anyone to purchase the 1995 Ford Explorer Sport unless given to you or you have too much money and you want to use it on repairs
