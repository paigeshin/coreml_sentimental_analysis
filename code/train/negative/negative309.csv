 That 2001 Ford Explorer you may be considering is not as new as you think  Sure  it smells new  it s shiny  and it looks modern  but the mechanicals underneath are anything but new The explorer started out life in 1990  It was at the time  a break through  It handled nicely for a truck  had lots of room for people  pets  and cargo  and did everything well  The public reacted by making it the best selling sport utility vehicle in the country  and ever since  it has held that title  I can see the practical reasons why Americans hold this SUV so dear after a number of hours behind the wheel of my company s jet black 2001 Explorer 4x4 4 door XLS The explorer does everything well for 90  of American drivers  The afformentioned room  reliability  towing ability  and resale value have made it a hit here But I am one of those 10  of Americans who would find the Explorer lacking  Compared to new SUV s  the explorer feels every bit of 10 years old  Don t get me wrong  I owned a 1991 explorer for 5 years when it was new  and I liked it  But compared to newer SUV s  the Jeep Grand Cherokee for one  the steering feels dead and it handles like a much bigger vehicle  The stock ford stereo is among the worst sound systems I have heard in a modern car  It is a stereo cassette unit with very bad accoustics  and to get normal driving volume  the stereo needs to be half way cranked up Spend a little more and go for the all new from the ground up 2002 model  It handles much better  is roomier  and can finally truly compete with the modern crop of SUV s
