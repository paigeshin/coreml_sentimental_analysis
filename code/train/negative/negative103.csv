 I bought this car new in September  1992 principally because my wife and daughter liked the Forest Green color  SUV s were popular then  and my wife liked the idea of being higher than the rest of the traffic  The truck is somewhat bouncy  and if you are on a rough road  you really feel it  The good thing about the setup is the chair height  Your knees are closer to a ninety degree angle when you ride  and that is a lot easier on your back than a sedan While the body style may be unstable in sharp turns  it sure holds a lot of haulage  I have used it to truck each one of my kids to college  I have found the truck to eat front brake pads  I average around 15k a set  I also think that there are problems with the design of the truck  The catalytic converter is in a place where it heats the transmission  and causes it to fail early  It is also near the front control arm bushing  and heats it so that it fails early  These are expensive repairs  The front suspension needed replacement as well At around 120K  the transmission failed in a catastrophic manner  and it cost around  2 200 00 to replace with a remanufactured unit  My dilemma is this  The truck still looks great  It has around 138k on it at this point  The engine is still tight  However  the AC Delco remanufactured transmission is now starting the same death dance as the old one  Right now  reverse is slow to engage when it is cold  This is how the other transmission started to fail  According to the transmission guy I deal with  this is a common problem with Explorers  He has one  and his transmission does the same thing The truck is still expensive to keep up  It is always needing something like brakes  tie rod ends  exhaust parts and such  I have also detected weeping around the water pump  I don t know whether to sell it now  or keep it for the long haul  This truck is for someone who likes to make a good appearance  and has deep pockets for maintenance  It is not for someone who appreciates fuel economy or low maintenance cost  The 1992 Explorer is an early version  and there are a lot of bugs in it  Some of the bugs were worked out in the 1995 makeover  However  it looks like the biggest bug  the tendency to roll over  will not be worked out until the 2002 model
