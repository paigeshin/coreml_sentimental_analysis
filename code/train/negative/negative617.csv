 I NEVER owned an American Car  I bought this 1998 Ford ZX2 because my 25 year old son decided to work for a Ford Dealership and A  he gave me a great price and B  I didn t want his boss to think he couldn t sell a car to his own mother  I ve had it a year and half now and I have to say that I wish I had my Mazda Protege back  Not that I ve had any problems with it so far but the biggest problem has been the NOISE  It is LOUD  Between the road noise and the air conditioner I have to turn the radio to dangerous levels to hear the music  And speaking of the sound system   radio cassette  well  I ve heard much better  It just doesn t have any pizzazz  The engine runs hard  Even when I m in 5th gear   manual  I find myself re shifting and trying to get into a higher gear because it sounds as if the engine is laboring  About 3 days after I got the car  I spent about an hour looking for the trunk release button  I finally figured out that there wasn t any  The only way to open the trunk was either with the key or with the remote trunk release button  Except  both methods require that the ignition be turned off unless you use a second key  So that when I drop my partner off at the airport  I can t open the trunk to remove the luggage with the car running Also  it s supposed to be a 12 gallon gas tank but I feel like I m at the gas station all the time  The car is cramped in front  I m 5 4 quot  and I have to pull the seat up pretty far in order to reach the pedals  but the further you sit up  the closer your head is to the sun visors  They seem to be right in my face I don t know  It s not a BAD car really  but all in all it s pretty much a car that even a mother couldn t love
