 The reason that I bought my Ford Contour  is because we badly needed a dependable car  At least that is what we thought we were getting  On a whim we went to our nearest Ford dealer and started pricing new cars  We were trying to trade in our old piece of junk  But as we found out  we enjoyed our old piece of junk better than our new car We purchased this vehicle in November of 1999  We paid approximately  18 000  The salesperson was very helpful and knowledgeable in his field  Since November we have had several problems with this car  It has a high idle when coasting in the city and rural roads  usually under 45 mph  It does excellent on the highway  We have taken several trips from Indiana to North Carolina and have had no problems to speak of  This vehicle has a lot of room in the front but very little in the back  The side strip molding is falling off  It does not want to stay on very well  There is a constant rattling in the passenger side of the dash board  We have not had to take this car in yet but we are in the process of taking for its first visit to the dealership  This car comes equipped with cruise control  tilt steering wheel  ac  am fm cassette stereo  and a very spacious trunk  Also has low profile tires  which the only problem with that is that they are very expensive to replace  The interior and exterior colors are very pleasant to look at  I would not recommend this particular Ford automobile to the average person  This is for the average family of more than three people  I would not buy this car again because of the problems that we have encountered br br
