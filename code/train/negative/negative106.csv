 My Ford Explorer was the first vehical i have ever bought on my own  The thing after i bought it was great  Loved it to death  I owned the road in it and i loved working on it Then one day the transmission went out  No big deal i thought  this happens after 138 000 miles  After that all was good for awhile till something else broke  When ever one thing would break  it would break something else  I spent over  1200 fixing sensors that blew each other out  Finally the last straw was when my engine blew  Evidently a bearing went out and is causing the crankshaft to walk out of the engine  ITs off the road now waiting to be rebuilt then sold to some other unlucky person Driving it was great  Off road or on road i only got stuck once  i was dumb  and it hugged the road  In my buddies Explorer  same year  we spun out on a dirt road goin 55 and was going sideways down the road  I figured we would have flipped over but it stayed stuck to the road  when we hit the clay embankment  injuries were non existant and the total damage was around  1000  It took the beating with out a problem  I was in a fender bender in mine and all i had was a scratch on my bumper when the lady had to get a whole new grill and stuff  I think the problem was that my bumper hit her grill hood  Too bad for the small car This is a great truck for someone who wants to rebuild it and modify it but not for someone with a small budget  me  The costs of keeping the engine and sorts working with this many miles on it was just too much br br
