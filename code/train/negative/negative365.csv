  It s a way of life  My wife had always wanted a Mustang so last year we bought one of the first  99 Cobras off the truck  Our Cobra is a rio red coupe with medium parchment interior  I had some experiences with the Mustangs of the late  80s but there is no comparison  This is a true sports car  The new IRS make the car handle like it is on rails  What other car can you purchase for under  30k that has a hand built engine  The SVT folks treat you right also  The latest gift is a leather Jacket  The only negatives is the noise level inside the car  This is to be expected with a true performance car but it gets old on road trips
