 While the Ford Explorer may for some be a terrific vehicle  two years with mine has me wanting more for my money  First thing I noticed about it was how the rear view mirror reduces the visibility when trying to see objects in front and slightly to the right  The mirror creates more front blindspot than I have ever seen in a vehicle  Definitely a safety oversight on Ford s part  In addition  the power windows have failed twice in the first year  the front tires have worn irregularly due to parts not originally installed for front end adjustments that need to be added  and an exhaust manifold that leaks which creates a tapping sound  The manifold problem has been addressed three times with the service department and the problem still exists to some degree  The service of my Explorer at the local dealer Merced CA  has been extremely poor  They have on three occasions not completed the work as promised and left me without a vehicle  offering no loaner  Add to this terrible gas mileage  and I m looking to unload mine  Sad thing is  the retail value is a lot lower than your dealer will tell you
