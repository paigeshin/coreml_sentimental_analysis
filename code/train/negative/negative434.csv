 What is wrong with this car  you ask EVERYTHING The 2000 Mustang GT is a total lame excuse for a sportscar  I purchased a 2000 red Mustang GT in November of 1999  I was the first in my town to have one of the new bodystyles  The car was loaded  with sunroof  leather  CD with the premium speakers  all power you name it this car had it I was happy with my decision to buy a Mustang until the car wouldn t start one morning  My little red  Stang was only 4 months old and had less than 6K miles on her  I phoned the Ford dealership and explained my problem  They didn t even seem surprised and they weren t apologetic or understanding  After waiting THREE hours  and missing a day of work  the wrecker showed up and took my pretty red Mustang to the Ford dealership   Wait  I thought   I don t have transportation now I phoned Ford and asked for a rental or loaner car  Their reply   I can give you the number to Hertz Car Rental Great  I thought  and Ford is going to pick up the bill  right  WRONG  Ford told me I was on my own Come to find out  the alternator had gone bad  Ford replaced the alternator and I picked up my car the following morning  No big deal  right That very day the driver s side window wouldn t come back up after I put it down  The motor had gone out Back to the Ford dealership with no rental car  It took them two whole days to replace the motor I was furious I went to the Nissan dealership and test drove a Maxima  That was not what I was looking for  A friend told me to drive a Camaro Z28  I did just that The power  ride and handling was phenomenal  I had to have it  After picking up my POS Mustang GT  I took it straight to the Chevy dealership  before anything else could break on it  and traded it in for a 2000 Chevrolet CamaroZ28  I will be writing my review of my new Z in the near future If you re considering purchasing a Ford  atleast drive a Chevy first  I thank my friend everyday for referring me there  Don t make the same mistake I did  I try to let everyone know about my mishap with the Rustang and in doing so  I came across the following website www fordtruckssuck com Seems I m not the only one who s had NUMEROUS problems with Ford
