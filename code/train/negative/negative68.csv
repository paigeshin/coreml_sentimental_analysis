 I recently wrote a review of the 98 Ford explorer xlt  V8  AWD  I hate this car  which thank god  my lease is up this summer  I recently rode in a friends 99 explorer  XLT  V6  AWD  Although ford made several minor improvements  I still think this auto is an overpriced piece of garbage  It is overpriced  underpowered  and is generally just a low quality  high maintenance SUV  I have had many  many problems with my explorer  and my friend said the same thing  Also  on top of all the problems  their service is terrible  I think if you are considering buying this auto  look elsewhere  I recommend looking at the jeep line  or go with an import  You ll be very happy you did br br
