 I went for a test drive in a 2000 Excursion with the Eddie Bauer trim package with a friend who is looking to buy an SUV pretty soon  I ve always owned coupes and just one sedan in my lifetime  so this was very different for me  when i got behind the wheel so he cound ride in the back and check it out  I has a mix of feelings  I did feel like I was in tank or something because I was ridding high and felt the sheer magnitude of the truck as being something that was confidence inspiring  However  I didn t feel like I ws in control of the vehicle  Stoppng disances were super long and if something or someone happen to dart out in front of the truck  there was no way to safely swerve and aviod a most likely fatal collion with the victim  The truck rides nicely for it s size  The feel is very firm considering how large it is  The interior was done very nicely in leather trim  but I didn t at all like how it s simply kind of a dressed up Ford super duty truck interior  If you re paying over 36K for this thing  you deserve a little more exclusivisity  The exterior styling is very nice rough and rugged  The taillings are a little too similar to the econoline vans  but that s okay I suppose  My friend lives in a rural area and is involved in shipping large equipment on trailers  so it s the right kind of truck for him  However  I think people that simply buy this thing to use as a status symbol are pretty shallow and basically stupid  I don t see the logic is sayign you ve got the biggest and baddest truck out there when you have to pay over  60 to fill er up and use it to do things like go to the mall and take drive to work in alone while burning gasoline galore in gridlock  I d imagine parking this thing is a nightmare in tight urban spaces a parallel park might require one of those guys at the airport that guide the planes in with lighted torches  This vehicle also inspires a sense of false security and superiority in the event of a collision  People just simply think  quot If I crash  the other guy will die haha quot that might be true  but you ll pay later aside from the legal consequences  depending on if it was your fault you will have to live with the fact that because of the vehicle choice you made  you may have cripple  injured  or possibly even killed someone out there  The thing that s most frightening about this truck is that people who buy it in the city tend to be the type that chat away on cell phones all of the time that habit combined with the desructive potential of this thing can and will lead to many tragedies  You d think that the problem of teh wrong type of buyer getting this thing would be solved by the high gasoline prices  but that doesn t seem to be the case perhaps if we see prices over  2 50 per gallon  Bottom line  Ford made a good truck here  but it can t play big brother to control who buys people really need to become aware of the fact that SUV s do have dangers associted with them  i e  rollovers are more common  and make better choices  In the hands of the right buyer this truck is great
