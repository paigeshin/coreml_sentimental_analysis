 Although my 1996 automatic Aspire runs well  has decent pickup for a smaller car  and gets great gas mileage  I have been unfortunate to have had to replace the transmission 2 times and the transmission just went out again  so will be a 3rd time  The first time  at 32k  Ford honored the warranty  but the second time  even though it only had 22k on the transmission  there was 54k on the engine  so would not honor the original rebuilt or the extended warranty purchased with the car  As the transmission was rebuilt by a third party this last time  they are going to honor their work and cover the transmission  but if left up to Ford  I would have to pay again  so this economy car is costing more than that
