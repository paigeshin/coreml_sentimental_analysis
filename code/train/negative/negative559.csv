 I ve always liked Fords  and Explorers for that matter  but my third one put me over the edge  All three were bought used  between  9K and  12K  and all three were stock 1991 Explorers  two Eddie Bauers and my favorite of the three  a Sport  First of all  I like alot of things about Explorers  To be general  I like the size  the feel  steering and handling  the design  the price  and the look  It is a very practical SUV  it tackles most off road trails  minus serious 4 wheeling  it performs well  it gets decent gas mileage  91 that is  new ones are much more efficient  it is easy to service  and it comes from an AMAZING car company  Ford helps define American cars  My complaints  fuel pump  anti lock brakes  power steering  transmission  radiator  overheats  minor electrical problems  starter alternator  You d be amazed at the re occurances of many all of these problems in my three vehicles  Maybe it was a bad year  maybe we picked three lemons  but they all fell apart  We had the first one for two years before it was totaled in an accident  We put 4 or 5 thousand dollars into it just to keep it alive that long  Power steering went first  then the brakes  rotors  pads  calipers  the works  followed by hard starting and overheating  The transmission was the last to go  along with an overhauled 4x4  We were pretty happy with the car  despite little things like the backseat armrests falling off  When the time came  we opted for another  Enter the two door Sport  I loved that car  I felt very in control with it  and it was incredibly maneuverable compared to the XLT or Eddie Bauer  It had plenty of room  got better mileage  had more  zip  was easier to wash  performed better  and was just a fun car to own  Unfortunately  it had every problem I mentioned before  Power steering  BAD  fuel pump  alternator  transmission  and electrical glitches  passenger window didn t operate  power locks were broken  The transmission was never replaced  but it would have  along with a badly leaking radiator  if the anti lock brakes hadn t failed  the right front tire locked up  and totaled the car  Another one bites the dust  The third and current Explorer started off flawless  and the previous owner gave us his personal guarantee that the car was in perfect mechanical condition  It probably was until it fell apart on us  We had the car less than 3 months when  on a short road trip  the engine burnt up melted DIED  No warning  just occasional temperature fluctuations from normal to way hot  and back to normal  The engine was very expensive to replace  compared to other engine jobs my friends and family has encountered with other vehicles  By the time the new engine was broken in  the starter started to go  the rear hatch power lock broke  the oil pan and gasket needed to be replaced  and the transmission started to slip  The transmission hasn t been fixed yet  but it is about to drop  I don t think I have anything nice to say about this last Ford  as it is a true lemon  The sound system was very mediocre  considering it was their  premium  JBL setup  I only wish I could learn my lesson about Explorers  or Fords in general  but I can say now that I m probably not on my last Explorer  They really are fun cars  and they are very moderately priced  or at least as moderate as any used car today could be  If I had a choice  I d go for a full size Chevy Blazer  staying American  but I know I d be paying a higher price tag for it  If I ever get another Explorer  I d buy a few years newer  like 1994 1996  I hate looking at new car prices  and I would surely opt for the Sport br br
