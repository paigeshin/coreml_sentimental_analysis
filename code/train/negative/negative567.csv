 Like everyone else  I waited to see what Ford was going to replace the venerable Tempo Topaz model with  and was surprised to see the new Contour  What s more  as the motoring press praised the new car  especially the upscale Duratec V6 SE model  I thought I should go visit my Ford dealer and see what the fuss was about  as I was in the market for a replacement car  It just so happened the dealer had a Toreador Red SE manual demonstrator model with 600 kilometres fully loaded  except the CD player  The car was an absolute dream to drive  a smooth  powerful  throaty V6  a nice 5 speed  and wonderfully supportive heated leather seats with these nifty  airbag inflaters  that blew up for lumber support  etc  I am in Canada and leather on a minus 30 degree celsius day can really be uncomfortable  The car also had a really nice traction control system and this seemed like the car of my dreams and was a great winter driver  Being 2 months old and  3000 under list price made it a good deal plus it qualified for new car leasing  So I signed a 24 month lease and drove it away late that week Well  for the first month I loved that car  It was a dream to drive and suited my single sport sedan lifestyle  then things started to go wrong  SERIOUS THINGS that no warranty covers you for  One minus 20 morning  I drove the car out of my garage and headed off to work  The car seemed a little sluggish  but I though it was ok as any Canadian will tell you how  stiff and tight  a car becomes on the first cold day of winter  especially newer cars  I was driving about 40 kilometres an hour through a 8 lane intersection when a school bus decided to turn in front of me  I turned clear and hit the breaks and next thing I know I am spinning circles through the intersection  I never had a car do that to me  I didn t hit anything so I pulled out of the intersection at the time noticing my ABS error light was on  When I stopped and got out  I noticed steam and smoke rising of the rear brakes which was strange as one would have thought it would be coming from the front wheels with such a hard braking  My car was fitted with the really nice looking polished spoked alloys from Ford  stupid me reached down and touched the wheel  big mistake as a chunk of skin burned onto the spoke  Man was I fuming as I pulled into a snow covered car park to realize my rear brakes where locked on  the ebrake was off and functioning fine  I called the dealership  and they send down a tow truck  That afternoon they called me and said this was normal to have your brake piston caliper slide pin freeze when you take a warm car out of a garage and into the cold  What a  amp load  They said they parked the car in the garage and an hour later it was fine  So I went to get the car Well  would you believe what happened two weeks later  SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL again with the rear brakes locked  didn t hit anything this time either  This time the dealer had to deal with my wrath as I told them I was not going to pay my lease and they could stick that car where the sun didn t shine  They calmed me down and called me later to say that  they had noticed a few of the new Contours rear disk calipers brakes slide pins were not lubricated properly from the factory  and they had done this to mine and that it was now better then new  So  I went to pick up the car  Two weeks later  brakes were now working great  I noticed that the car was starting to get a slight grind putting the car into first  The clutch was too new to be worn out and I am not a hard driver on clutches  As the week wore on  the grind got worse and worse until the car would no longer engage first gear  hot or cold  Back to the dealer  They called me to say they could not know what was wrong without dropping the transmission  all on a 2 month old car with 1500 kilometres  So they took it apart and said the transmission 1st gear was faulty and needed to be replaced  two weeks later and driving a dealer loaner  my car was still not fixed  The parts were on terminal back order  Mad as could be  I fumed at the service manager and many calls later to Ford customer service in Canada  the dealer had a brand new replacement whole transmission being shipped from the Kansas assembly plant  One week later  I was back in my car but immediately I knew something was not right  The car was all over the road and there was a strange thumping noise that got worse and worse  This time the new transmission was working fine  2 days later back to the shop Turns out the mechanics had not completely tightened all the bolts on the front subframe assembly that  cradles  the transmission and motor  That afternoon I was back in my car  but now it was not driving straight  pulling right  but was tight  5 minutes out of the dealership the engine error light came on but I was too mad and tired  I just drove it home and parked it in the garage  Next morning I got up and went to the garage and thought I could smell gasoline  I got in the car and the smell was unbearable  What I found next was unbelievable  behind the drivers seat the floor pan was protruding up about 4 inches and the rear carpet was soaked in gas  I looked under the car and a pool of gasoline was all over the floor  I poked my head under the car and it was clearly evident the car was hoisted incorrectly by someone at the dealer on the floorpan right along the fuel lines  and one was ruptured  No sales manager has ever heard such a mad customer as I tore up my lease on the phone  A tow truck came and took the car away  Two days later  the dealer had me a brand new identical 1996 Contour SE V6  the only difference was this one was automatic with a CD player  my new girlfriend wanted an automatic and the dealer gave me exactly what I asked for  Same colour  sunroof  leather  etc  etc What I did notice on that 4month old 1st car with barely 2000 kilometres disturbed me  the nice grey leather seats had started to develop creases in the drivers seat leather  The car had spend some time in the cold  but was garaged at night  I would not expect such cosmetic problems to surface for at least a couple years  My current car  a 93 Honda Accord SE has 168 000 kilometres and the leather looks like new  I am not a big guy and the seats are treated with the same leather conditioner I treated the Ford leather with  The dealer took care of the lease and paid the cost differences to keep me happy on the replacement Contour  that car lasted 1 month until on one cold Canadian morning I started the car and the starter motor  stuck    burned out and exploded into several pieces doing quite a bit of damage under the hood  Ford cancelled my lease and I have never put foot in a Ford dealership again Now my story will may not be the typical ownership experience  What I did like about these cars was the Duratec V6 was a dream to drive  when it worked  the fit and finish was OK for a domestic car  the value for money seemed good  the cars were nimble and sporty to drive  the back seat  95  was a bit cramped but I didn t usually have rear passengers and the 96 had rear seats that were  scooped out  to give more rear knee room  The factory sunroofs were nice in that they retracted into the roof fully  The cars were nicely appointed with all the fixings you would expect on a premium SE model  The cars handled really nice  when they were put together properly  with the sportier handling on the SE versions  The 4 wheel disk brakes and the traction control did a nice job of getting the car moving and stopping even with the sport Firestone radials on the icy roads we have here in Canada  I can t say to much about the gas mileage as I never did get to drive the cars enough  The leather seats were really comfortable and very adjustable to any driver  Driver leg room was good  I am a tall guy  and the telescopic tilt steering wheel could be set up nicely  I never got to test the cruise control  steering wheel mounted  on my first car  nor on the second as it never worked on the replacement car  Would I recommend one of these cars  I think you can answer that if you have read this far   I don t know if I had really bad luck but I do know my 4 cylinder  older  Honda is not as powerful or new  but it sure is reliable  Regular maintenance only and no major faults  Some of my problems were dealer technician caused  but the problems should have never been there in the first place  My dad summed it up best   quot never buy a new model car  wait a couple years until the bugs are worked out  or at best  buy your car at the end of its product cycle  even it it doesn t seem as  new  anymore quot  I think he was spot on with the 95 96 Contour SE models br br
