 http www geocities com archangel jjn I really loved this car it was small and fun until the cowl cover cracked and it leaked into the passenger footwell every time it rained or I went to the car wash moisture entered the headlight and it needed to be replaced the cruise control stopped functioning the rear wheel bearings needed to be replaced due to a recall the wiper motor stopped working in the winter and needed to be replaced and before I owned it it needed new brake pads and rotors despite having less than 15 000 miles a new transmission and associated cooling hoses a new hatch strut and finally  after only having it 7 months and still being well within original factory warranty  it caught fire all by itself by a recall that happened 4 months after my incident  It ended up being totaled  See the pictures at http www geocities com archangel jjn So far  Ford s basic response is that it is an insurance issue  so if you think your car is protected by factory warranty against catastrophic failure  even from an issue covered by a recall  think again they ll leave you out swinging in the breeze  and you re left with only your insurance payout on the rapidly shrinking book value to pick up and start over
