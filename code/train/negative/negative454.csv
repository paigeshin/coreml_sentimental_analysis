 Dear Readers I think i have to start with a sad note  saying never dare to burn yourself buying this vehicle  I bought this vehicle in last September  I think i must have gone crazy when i bought this  I was actually misguided by its look for a 1994 model and the comfort it might offer for its size  Later realized it s nothing but money eater  What i like in this vehicle mm what could i say  Probably the size to accommodate more friends of mine who don t have a car  My list of hatred started with the problems 1  After just a week of buy i found that the engine bed bolts were weak and i had to change them 2  Two months later it was recalled for tightening the side frame bolts uh  i didn t know what it was and what the dealer did  No comments and details from the dealer 3  Three months later i had to change the rear wheel brake rotor  caliper  and shoes since there was misalignment with the caliper which eventually dug into the rotor disk 4  Now came the REAL BIG headache  The oil pressure lamp started to glow  I didn t knew what exactly was happening  Few days later i found out that the Engine coolant was getting dried up soon and also the engine was heating up sometimes  I am not a person who doesn t care for cars  actually i luv to do  Now i added higher viscosity oil  But after few days of oil change the lamp started to glow again  I took it to the dealer  then he confirmed my fate that my engine was no good  WHAT  yes the timing case gasket which is at the lower part of the vehicle has some defects and now the water has started to enter the engine chamber  Oh My GOD  What can i do now  Either replace engine or scrap the vehicle I tried contacting the FORD company  but nothing worked out  The company which was then offering warranty for Head Gasket leakage  didn t offer the warranty for this  I was helpless  And now my car stands in my apartment parking garage for no mistake of mine except for that I bought a Ford Vehicle From my perspective except for those people who lease the vehicle or take rentals shouldn t go for this when there are cars which could easily run for 1 3 rd s of your lifetime br br
