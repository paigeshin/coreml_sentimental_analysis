 I bought a new 97 F150  and I had it only 4 months and traded it in It was a v8  and it had no power what so ever We live on a mountain  and I would have to shift into 3rd gear to climb it  while little 4cy s were flying up it  I was embarrassed Sorry  but when I put that much money into something  I want it to perform for me  and this truck didn t I think this truck is best suited for flat areas  it did do well at highway speeds  but like I said   no power pulling a hill To be honest I like a truck that is a little more flashy looking  and this didn t make me say  quot wow quot this was the only vehicle that we have owned that I could say I hated it I know some people are reading this and saying they love their truck and I am glad you like yours  I didn t like mine br br
