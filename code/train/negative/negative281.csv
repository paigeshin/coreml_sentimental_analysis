 I bought this car because it was Saturday and I needed to get to work on Monday  My other car died and I was in a jam  My wife and I knew this car salesman  so we told him to keep an eye out for us  We couldn t afford anything over  5000 at the time  so when my buddy called about the 91 Thunderbird  I jumped at the offer  We ended up paying about  4000  and the shirts off our backs Let me start by stating that I purchased this car with 97 000 miles on it and it currently has 145 000 miles  I will reveal how this car has held up after 9 years and 1145 000 miles  and what I have done to it within my first 50 000 miles This car is fun to drive  There is something about owning a T Bird with the 5 0 V8 engine  This car has everything power windows  locks  mirrors  driver s seat  rear defrost  keyless entry and alloy wheels  This car is fast too  I m sure there are some 4 cylinders that can beat it off the line  but let s see who s first to 100 mph  turbos need not apply The handling is a joke  This car likes to roll into turns no matter how slow you go  It sort of wobbles when I turn  It s not visible wobble  but it feels like it moves from side to side while turning  This got better after I purchased new tires for it  but it s starting to happen again with only about 30 000 miles on the new tires  Apparently  this car only likes brand new tires  Make no mistake  this car is not a sports car  Sure  it has a 205 hp V8  but the car is just to heavy and long  It bounces over bumps  and you ll feel every one  The steering wheel likes to shimmy too  Again  this may fix itself when I replace the tires At first  the car s finish has held up very well  There is little rust to speak of  The only visible rust is due to a bent corner on the driver s door  I m not sure how the guy before me bent that  There is also some rust along the bottom of the doors  This is only visible if the doors are open and you actually look at the underside of the doors  There are a few specks of peeling paint on the black trim on the front bumper  The trunk lines don t seem to fit together evenly  but I suspect the guy before me was in a slight accident  Now  the clearcoat is beginning to peel on the roof  After 150 000 miles though  you can t be too surprised The interior has held up very well too except the front seats  There are no cracks or blemishes in the entire dash board and there is no fading either  The only part of the interior that shows any sign of wear are the seats  which are very worn and uncomfortable  The rear arm rests are bulging out of their notches too  and the release levers on the front seats are busted  You can move the seats forward without using the levers  That s not a big deal though Speaking of broken  the rear defrost took that path around 100 000 miles  The fluid monitoring system is gone too  I think the transmission missed the rear defrost  because it went around the same time  It took with it 3 02 sensors  some belts and hoses  the water pump  the power steering assembly  a turn signal assembly and some fuel lines  The mechanic actually said there had been a fume fire on my gas tank  I think I might have bent over on that one  but who knows  I think my tires are getting lonely  I will have to replace them in a few weeks  The passenger automatic seat belt is possessed  I just try not to upset it I have spent about  6000 in repairs from August 1999  to May of 2003  It has been trouble free for the past few months  knock  knock  At least the dealership where I bought it from agreed to pay for half of my new transmission  which I had repaired elsewhere  That s a Toyota dealership for you The speedometer only goes to 85 mph  That s pretty wimpy for a V8  I ve had the thing burried way past 85  The radio rots  I m not sure if it s just old  or if radios weren t that good 10 years ago  There is an absolute lack of bass  My voice can go lower than these 6x9s  I just put in a Kenwood CD player and some Polk speakers  Even these entry level items are a vast improvement I may be crazy  but I love my T Bird  Despite it s shortcomings  there s just something about driving a V8 T Bird  I will definitely miss this car when it s time to trade it in for a familymobile I would recommend this car as a first car for people in high school because it is a cheap car to buy  the resale value is horrible  but the V8 would get them into trouble and the V6 is laughable  It would make a good car for a single person or a couple who isn t ready  smart enough  to purchase a Camry UPDATE  07 31 00 The new tires solved the wobbly turns and the shimmying steering wheel  This car handles much better now  so forget those negative comments I made about the handling  This car does handle more like a sports car now than it did  It is still a little off balanced as far as weight distribution  but the handling has improved  Check out my review of the Firestone Firehawk tires UPDATE  09 09 00 Well  the starter went out so I had to replace that  116 000 mile isn t too bad for something like that  That brings the grand total for the repair bill to about  4500 since I bought this car in August of 99  I m not liking this car so much UPDATE  01 03 00 Well  some clamp came loose on the radiator which caused some antifreeze to spill out  Not too bad  only  30 UPDATE  06 03 01 The airconditioner needed to be recharged  Figures  Another  80 down the drain   120 000 miles UPDATE  01 30 02 The O2 sensors needed to be replaced again  This is the third time in 30 000 miles UPDATE  06 11 02 I put in another 2 grand into this thing  I replaced the shocks  oil pan  and a bunch of brake junk  I had to recharge the A C again  which is becoming an annual event  The Check Engine light comes on for no reason I must say  the car rides so much better now that I have replaced the shocks  I also had to replace the tire rods and a buch of crap related to that  The car s more quiet now and rides much stiffer  It s nice  Still  make sure you don t buy one of these things with 100k miles on it UPDATE  05 12 03 I have edited some of the content
