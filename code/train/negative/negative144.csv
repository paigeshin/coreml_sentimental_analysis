 I am a proponent of domestic vehicles  I realize that many imports are reported to have better quality assurance  better final product  I have never felt that the inflated cost of North America s favorite imports could be justified  maybe now I do  My 1998 Ford Windstar L has been a disappointment  I live in the country and commute daily to a large metropolitan area for work  It is a drive that could be considered  quot easy quot  as it is mostly highway driving on secondary roads at about 55 mph with not many stop and go s  Because of my commute I put on about 28 000 miles a year  I currently have approximately 41 000 miles  I require a reliable  comfortable and relatively economical vehicle  Surprisingly enough  the Windstar I own averages about 26 mpg and I have had up to 31 mpg in ideal weather conditions  The fuel economy was a pleasant bonus  On the other hand my Windstar has had MANY annoying small problems  During the warranty period  first 36 000 miles  I have had the following problems  a  Check Engine Light on  sensor defect  b  Mass Air Flow Sensor  MAF   when it goes you re dead in the water  improper air fuel mixture  it happened at 25 000 miles  c  Door ajar sensor  this one needs to be talked about  The sensor went due to a short in the ground  Interestingly enough  the rear wiper uses the same ground and as a result the rear wiper motor was fried  When this sensor goes   and it s over the weekend with no service dept  open  you have no alternative but to disconnect your battery as the dome light inside cannot be manually turned off  and if you don t your battery will run down  By disconnecting the positive battery terminal  you reset the onboard monitoring computer which renders engine diags  impossible until the computer  quot relearns quot  your driving habits and can set baselines for diagnostics  Maybe Ford  and other manufacturers that have the same setup  should use a separate backup system battery like the lithium Ion backup battery found in a Personal Computer  This sensor has gone twice  once due to a short in the ground  the other time for no apparent reason  It continues to sporadically go on and off while driving  d I have had occasional clunking in the front end  I brought the vehicle into the dealership and told them I suspected the transmission  It has occasionally had difficulty up down shifting at the gear cusp to overdrive about40 mph  They could find no obvious problem  but did find loose tie rods and replaced them  I am now past basic warranty and have the air bag sensor light staying on 6 seconds past when all other sensors have been initiated at startup  According to my manual  I need the air bag checked immediately  The feel of my vehicle is still not right  I have sporadic shuddering from either the transmission  the Mass Air Flow sensor  or the tie rods  or the idle arms etc  etc  My decision comes down to maintaining a safe vehicle by dumping money into an obviously sub standard product  or getting rid of it and eating a large amount of negative equity  I have had the vehicle only 16 months  Any way I look at it  keeping it may cost fortune  trading it will definitely cost a fortune  Either way  I as the consumer have been shafted A colleague of mine has a 96 Windstar and just had its transmission rebuilt  52 000 miles  It seems that Ford continue to use a transmission with a known engineering flaw  an aluminium piston  I had a 94 Sable wagon that had the piston go and the transmission was rebuilt with a steel piston as the replacement  Why doesn t Ford just re engineer the transmission  do a general recall and change the piston So what can I do  I have 3 children and need the flexibility of a minivan  I can t afford to change my vehicle every 1 1 2 years  Ford  Quality is no longer Job   1 Epilogue  I buckled  bit the bullet  dumped the turkey  The vehicle above has been traded for a Toyota Corolla  Big difference from a minivan  small for my family of five  but a great little car  Maybe Ford should pay out the negative equity that I just had to eat br br
