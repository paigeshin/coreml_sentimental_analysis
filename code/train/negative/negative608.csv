 For all you folks who may own a 1994 F 150  have you ever had a flat tire  If you havn t you just may want to check your jack  Yes it should be there but it will do you no good  The owners manual gives you 2 choices of jacking positions  a primary and a secondary  here is where the problem lies  Your jack is too big for the primary point  won t fit there  and not tall enough to use the secondary  won t lift the truck enough to put on the tire  According to the service manager at the local Ford Dealer there was a notice on this four years ago  but no fix  I have been fighting for answers for three weeks now  to no avail and no help from Ford  Best advice the dealer could give me was buy an aftermarket jack  not the answer I expected  I currently own two Fords  a Crown Vic  and the Truck  These will be my last all for the sake of a  20 00 jack  SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER a concept lost to the Ford Motor Company  A word to the wise  check this problem out before you too are stranded br br
