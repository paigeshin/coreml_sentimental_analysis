 I am an extremely unhappy owner of a 95 POC Windstar w 120K miles  I am posting this so that potential Windstar owners know what to expect a few thousand miles down the road  It was a fight to get reimbursed for my blown head gaskets back at 57K miles  There is constantly something wrong with this car from electrical problems to AC problems  to electrical door lock problems   to chimes and warning lights always going off  I religiously maintain this car  following the Ford recommended maintenance to the  quot T quot  One month after my 120K maintenance in which they reportedly  quot inspect the engine cooling system quot  the POC left me stranded with a blown front cover gasket and a failed water pump  The repair shop told me the warning signs should have been visible during the  quot inspection quot  I have performed extensive research on Windstar problems and know my situation is not isolated  Both dealerships in the Charlton  SC area  Jones and Palmetto have lousy service departments and just give me the run around when I bring these issues up  So beware potential Ford Windstar Owners  Ford claims to have fixed the problem  but do you want to take the chance  Don t believe all the Ford Hype  Our 91 Honda is running like an old reliable clock at 140K with only routine maintenance  No equipment failures on the Honda and I hear the same thing from many Honda Owners br br
