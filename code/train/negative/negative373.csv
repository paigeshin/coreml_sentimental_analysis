 I purchased a brand new bright red truck in November 1995 my husband said   not another red truck  Yes  I like red  and I like trucks I had brought home a darker blue truck  but it was automatic  power windows  and other frilly stuff that I didn t want or want to pay extra for  My truck had the following features 6 cylinder  standard transmission  5 speed  anti lock brakes  back sliding window  long bed  A C  power steering  and a bed liner What I liked about this truck  at the time I bought it  was that we could all fit into it  However  for my older kids  the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips  The last big trip was from Tennessee to Oklahoma and then back  My son at the time was 15 and my daughter was 12  They were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front  And I liked the price  It cost  12 799 with all the financial stuff  This was the third vehicle that I bought at  Woody Anderson Ford  in Huntsville  AL  And If I still lived there  I probably would have traded it there and bought another Ford product I was faithful about regular maintenance  but this silly truck had a mind of its own  First it was the door open chime it just would not shut off  Back to the dealership  it was covered under the warranty  Then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership  covered by warranty  By this time I was wondering if I had made a good decision about this truck  Then the interior light would not shut off  my husband just got a potholder from the kitchen and yanked the bulb out  He was beginning to be frustrated by constant trips to the dealer for little electrical repairs I noticed a smell around 35 000 miles or so  Something was hot under my truck  I took it in and asked them if there was anything under there that might get hot during driving  They checked the radiator  and other items like brakes etc but not the problem  After the big trip to Oklahoma  it finally broke  and it was a carrier bearing  My mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not so long  it didn t really need to be built like this  Just another moving part to break Once all of the electrical problems were repaired and the carrier bearing was repaired  the truck was very reliable for 120 000 miles  And a trip to South Carolina  Myrtle Beach  At that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of 5  We bought a  Plymouth Grand Voyager   van  See my review on it please My truck was not a reliable vehicle in ice it froze to the ground and we could not budge it no matter what we tried hahahhaha only in Tennessee right  Okay  so maybe it was built on a Monday  maybe it was just that model year  But I did not buy another Ford truck and I had owned 2  so maybe I ll let Fords rest and get a Toyota or a Chevy next truck purchase
