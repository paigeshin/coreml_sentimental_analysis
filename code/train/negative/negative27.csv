 I purchased a used 1992 high top with all the toys  t v  vcr  nintendo  remotes  queen size fold down bed  built in oak cabinets  built in coolers  all the goodies of the tiarra package  It was absolutely beautiful  I purchased it with the intention of enjoying it while traveling to Florida from Ohio  Never did make it though  You see  it didn t like warm weather for some reason  It stalled every single time the temperature outside reached 73 or higher  I would have to pull over to the side of the road and wait about 20 min  then go on my way again for another hour or so before it would stall again  I had it to 4 shops which all said it was fine and no Ford dealer within miles believed a word I said  I replaced computer components 2x  over  3000 of my own money  and the problem never went away  I replaced brakes on it as often as I changed the oil  I wanted badly to sell the van but felt aweful at the idea of someone else getting as stuck with it as I was  I finally traded it in for a new Dodge van and the day I did  everything in it shorted out  The t v  wouldn t work  the vcr wouldn t work  the seats wouldn t move  and yet all the fuses were tested and checked out to be fine  The service men at 3 shops that day told me they could find no reason whatsoever for the things not being perfectly normal because it showed power going to all areas as if totally normal  What s worse though was the lousy 9 mpg I got  It was terribly expensive to drive  to insure  and to keep up  Too bad too it was so beautiful br br
