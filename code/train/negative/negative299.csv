 A friend of mine just paid more than  20 000 to try to get the comfort I have in a van almost ten years older and  13 000 cheaper  We have a 1990 model Ford Aero Star  This van is awesome and most comfortable  The Windstar has much less head room than the Aero Star  It is much easier to get in and out of the older van than the new one  Even with the so called upgrades Ford has established in their newer vans it is apparent they cut too many corners in developing the Windstar  Our Aero Star was modified by Qualico with more plush seats  and interior courtesy lights for each passenger  Even so  the Aero Star vans that I have traveled in that are just off the production line are hands down better than the Windstar  Aero Star were available with four wheel drive  This is not an option with the Windstar  If you only have town driving to contend with and real comfort isn t an issue buy yourself a Windstar  If you are looking for comfort and a more road compatible vehicle buy yourself a used Aero Star br br
