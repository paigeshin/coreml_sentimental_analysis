 Be ready to spend lot s of   with Today s Gas Prices  This vehicle is definitely a REAL GAS GUZZLER  Just don t know how long I can afford to keep it  Several things drove me to purchase my 2000 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  It definitely offers spacious comfort  this is definitely a plus  My kids have really enjoyed the ability of having rear CONTROL of the MUSIC and the A C  Personally  I like the built in earphone jacks that the rear offers and they do use them  Only kids with their short legs can really enjoy the 3rd seat  The 3rd seat is O K  for now with kids  that is  However  third seat definitely not for adults  With two different drivers in my household for this same vehicle  I have really enjoyed the feature that allows you to pre set the adjustments of the seats  mirrors  gas  amp  brake pedals using the key remote  this I REALLY like  At first I really had a concern as to whether  I  a 4 11 quot  woman  could really handle driving a vehicle this size  With the handy step up boards and hand grips  getting on or off is not a problem at all  I was also concerned about turns and parking  again not a problem at all  OVER ALL  it is really pretty smooth to drive and handles well  With it s size I feel a great sense of safety  although an impact is an impact  I just feel it would be a bit different in comparison to the size vehicle I previously drove  It also feels great to drive up high We took our first out of town trip in it last month  I have only had it 60 days at that time  I must say  it s definitely much better mileage on long distance travel  The one thing we really did not prepare for was the lack of luggage space  Yes  it does have an above exterior luggage rack  however  we found out at the stops along the way  we had to try to park where our vehicle would be within view  because of our luggage  even though it was tied down and pretty secured  we still felt unsure of leaving it out of sight AGAIN  THIS VEHICLE IS JUST SUCH A GAS GUZZLER  I JUST DON T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN AFFORD TO KEEP IT br br
