 Everyone has heard of all these great new innovations that are intended to make our everyday lives more convenient you know  disposable diapers  disposable cameras  disposable contact lenses  and I believe this was Ford s idea of a disposable car  I was so in love with my electric blue 95  Ford Probe SE  Sport Edition  in the beginning  As I drove it off the lot with its 37 miles on it I lovingly named it Poindexter and vowed to wash it on a bi weekly basis  It was truly cherished a car among cars mine  I loved the way it handled  the sleek body style  the gas mileage  the way men turned their heads as I drove past  but all that came to an end  except the head turning   tee hee  within the first year  It all began when the vanity mirror fell off the passenger side sun visor  It may sound small  but you would be amazed how many people use that thing  Shortly after the trunk on the hatchback decided to wimp out and tried to decappatate you at the first moment you weren t looking  The windows rattled every time you drove and my cigarette lighter fizzled out on me  Good thing it was all under warranty  Right  Well  some of it Ford took responsibility for and fixed as well as expected I suppose  Everything else was cosmetic and wasn t included in the warranty  Great  Although all women know that cosmetics are important  I ve never considered myself stuck up enough to really care about trivial things  It got me to school  to work  to parties  and those were what mattered  until suddenly it didn t  About 4 months before the warranty was up  the battery gauge on the dash would go from the dead center to  quot oh no  absolutely no juice quot  every time I would come to a stop  Driving a car without stopping is actually kind of difficult  so back to the shop  quot Dex quot  went  Two weeks later they deciphered it was nothing more than the battery and I was free to pay the  175 that was not covered by the warranty  Yee Haw Well  to make a long story short  my warranty expired and suddenly they figured out exactly why my car was acting funny  It needed a new set of belts  Then when that didn t fix it  it needed a new altenator  then a distributor cap  then spark plugs and eventually an idle speed motor  The brakes have been done 3 times  the last time costing me  1200 because I needed shocks  calipers  rotors  and God knows what else  I ve needed 4 new rims  3 sets of tires  2 new antenna motors   and a partridge in a pear tree  and have had to deal with the fact that the material is dangling off the ceiling of my car and my seatbelts won t go back in their slots  I have sunk the value of my car into my car in the past year alone  Now  I am a girl  and guys seem to always think I was ripped off  but what do you do when you re single and your car is sitting in a shop with the wheels off   No  crying didn t help  I tried that  Reliability is definitely not it s strong suit  Well  I can finally write this opinion with a clear conscience  because as of yesterday I am a Chevy owner  I finally got my 00  Silverado  extra cab  step side and will not have to worry about dealing with Ford again  I have named it Maverick  in hopes that a tougher name might make for a tougher vehicle    It is so nice to have a vanity mirror again
