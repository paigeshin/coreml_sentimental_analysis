 My two year old Ford Taurus has been in for service ten times for the same steering and alignment problem  Each time  the service manager says   quot It s fixed quot  as they always replace some suspension component  BUT  it s never fixed  In fact  it keeps getting worse  They will not provide a loaner  even though it s under warranty and has been out of service at the dealer for OVER 60 days now I like the car  based on its styling  size  features  etc  but now my wife will no longer drive it  it s just too difficult to keep it going straight  You have to exert a considerable amount of effort to the steering wheel to stop the pulling which gets worse the faster the car is going Now the service manager say   quot We don t want to put any more money into your car  so we ll give you  3000 off a new one to trade out of your car quot  But  they offered me  8500 to  9000 for my car that had a sticker of  25 250 only 2 years ago  That s another way Ford gets to make money on you  they try to shift their problem to you even though you have a warranty  and they believe you should pay them for their incompetence  and total disrespect for their customers What I think  they would then sell this car on their used car lot for an additional profit  of course  and cause another customer to suffer with it like we did  If they could fix it before putting it on the used car lot  why wouldn t they fix it for me  ANSWER  They can t and they don t care who they hurt as long as they make money at the customer s expense My advice  Ford makes nice  interesting cars  but when they make a bad one  they don t care  The Ford Customer Assistance Center  CAC  says you have to take these issues up with the dealer  I told them my warranty is from Ford  They do not care  So beware of buying a Ford  the warranty means nothing to them  THEY DO NOT CARE
