 The story begins when we rented a 1999 Ford Windstar LX  because our 1998 Nissan Maxima was in the shop for a routine check up  then a mechanic went to park the car and had a 5mph run in with a garage wall  So while the car was getting fixed  the nearby dealership gave us a rental  We had it for a week and loved it  despite all the articles in Consumer Reports telling potential buyers not to buy this vehicle  we had a pleasant time with it  When you get in and drive the vehicle you can t help but notice it s size at 201in  but I am not just talking about its length  I am also talking about the height of this vehicle  66 5in  Those things don t pose a big problem though  because the visibility is great  especially with all the glass and there is tons of head room  The floor pan is low and that makes the Ford Windstar easy to get in and out of  The only thing that disappointed me with this van  was the amount of standard features  The simplest things like a CD player  center console and standard middle captains chairs would have been nice and probably got us to buy a Windstar  but because the lack of standard features for the price  we will just stick with the Maxima  Lastly  if you don t mind paying 30 000 for a van with less standard equipment than a Grand Caravan or Grand Voyager  and having questionable reliability  then the 1999 Ford Windstar is the van for you
