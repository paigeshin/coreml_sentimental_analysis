 I have always hated Fords except for the Explorer which is an amazing car  but I absolutely hate the Taurus so much  It is a waste of room on the Highway  and it baffles me why people buy this car  it always falling apart like a typical Ford sedan does  Who in the right mind would buy this piece of JUNK No I really hate this car  it has no positive feature to it  and to top it off  it is one of the number one selling cars in the country  believe it or not  I dont believe it but it s actually true  I HATE FORDS  i hate them so much  They are terrible cars  dont buy them br br
