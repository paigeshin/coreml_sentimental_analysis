 We have bought this car in Feb  2001 and kept for 9 months Because the car was really cheap  the car has been working satisfactorily  But the car requires maintenance every months causing minor problems here and there The car has 91 000 miles and we had to fix so far as follows the cost of labor includes  starter 227  front end   alternator 241  a hole in radiator 86    new radiator 125  a c not fixed yet    door lining tipping don t bother fixing them  This car has been teaching us how to maintain the car because it breaks down very often
