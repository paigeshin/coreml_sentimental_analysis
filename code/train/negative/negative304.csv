 First thing is  I did not purchase a Windstar  I rented the Windstar for 3 days  After the 1st 2 min  of driving this vehicle I instantly did not like it at all  This was a fairly loaded Windstar  the seats were horribly uncomfortable  It had powered seats  but no matter where I positioned them  my top of my back and up had no cushion  I can imagine what kind of whipplash I could expect if I was in a accident  Next I notice that  good ole  Ford continues to make cars without a choice of Circulated and Re Circulated ventilation  I think all the other car makers do  The ventilation system was very weak  The fan only had 4 speeds and the 2 lowest fluctuated dramatically  The buttons and temp  slide adjustment was very loose  I also noticed that the pedals where too close to the drivers seat  so the peddals where close the steering wheel was far  This vehicle had only 2400 miles on it  I m average size man  5 10 quot  When you get out of the van  to open the back door it s  quot locked quot  very annoying  The stereo had very small buttons  example was the am fm button  Ride was like a boat  a lot of swaying from side to side  engine noise was abundant and  quot throaty quot  Acceleration was uneven  sudden jumps when applying the accelerator  Braking was the worst  Very mushy and very hard to stop  I would not recommend this vehicle at all  Go purchase a Chrysler Minivan br br
