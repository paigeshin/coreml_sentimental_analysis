  Introduction  You d never believe it  I d never believe it  I decided to stop by the Ford dealer to take a look at this POS F 150 and compare it to the 454SS  The sales guy walks up and starts talking about how great a truck it is  Not wanting to damage my chances  I agreed with him  Then the unimaginable happened  He says   quot So  you wanna drive it quot I really had no reason to  but why not  This offer was crazy because I m an 18 year old kid  driving a Blazer with a brand new paint job that could maybe sell for  5 000 tops  the Lightening was sticker priced at over  32 000 b The drive  I didn t treat this truck like I should have for this article No all out acceleration  no tire spinning  but to tell the truth  she surprised me  The entire time I was driving the truck  it kept occurring to me that it was as fast as it was going to get I took her around the city a little bit  then a short sprint on the highway  I wouldn t buy one even if I had the cash b Pros  This thing is faster than the Ford Mustang Cobra  It ll run 0 60 in 5 9 seconds and the 1 4 mile in 13 6 right off the lot  It really helps that she has a big Vortec Blower under the hood It was a lot more comfortable than I was expecting  The other F 150 I have experience in was very uncomfortable  this one I felt like I could spend the whole day in and be fine  The truck I drove had a bench seat  I think you can also get sport bucket seats  This is one up on the 454SS If you use it to tow just not a lot  the exhaust is in front of the tire  so you won t get carbon all over your trailer The CD player was pretty nice  I brought along a Bon Jovi song to test it out  since I ve heard good things about it  I wasn t disappointed  the bass was good for stock and the four speakers filled the interior nicely That s all folks  I can t think of a single other pro b Neutral  The ride was better than in the other F 150 I ve driven  but still not as soft as a 454SS One thing that is nice in the Lightening that is unneeded  that should be in the 454SS is a tachometer b Cons  First of all  the obvious opinion  I think this truck is uglier than sin  Its too big to be as low as it is  It looks clumsy  The 454SS is a much better looking truck  even the generation one Lightenings are better looking You ll never get it to compete on the road tracks against the Cobra  at least not in a reasonable price range The Special Vehicle Team  SVT  did a wonderful job pulling every last pony pound of torque out of the 5 4 liter V8  Your problem is that you ll have a heck of a time getting the truck going faster than 13 6   100 mph in the quarter mile  My recommendations are underdrive pullies and new heads  Or just stick a real engine in there  After talking to an owner  the only thing he was able to do to his was cosmetic junk The automatic transmission is ridiculous  A sports car or truck has to have a manual transmission option  Otherwise it is slow How about some gas mileage here  Sure  its not as bad as her arch rival  the 454SS  but it is awfully low at 14 miles per gallon  Especially with that little engine One large selling point for the 454SS was that it will easily tow 10 000 lbs  With the Lightening  you ll be able to tow half that  Which is less than the S 10 Extreme with 3 04 smallest  rear end b Overall  I d take a 454SS anyday  You can get the Chevy for way less  and for a little bit of money  you can really get that big block moving The Lightening is pretty much torqued on to death and you won t get too much more speed out of it You ll have a little more trouble finding a 454SS  but price difference and likeability will be much greater If you just want to go fast and don t care if it s a truck  get a Camaro SS or Cobra Mustang  Same price  better handling  better gas mileage  more aftermarket If you re really interested in sport trucks  I have written an article on the 454SS My recommendation  avoid the Lightening br br
