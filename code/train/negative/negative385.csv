 I just recently bought a used 1993 Ford Taurus  Mind you  this is the first and ONLY Ford I have ever owned  I had the car less than three months when everything started falling apart  First the radiator goes  and then the water pump  Then the driver s side mirror fell out onto the street while driving  Next  a piece of the muffler falls off in my driveway  And finally  the driver s side window won t open  The rear brakes went 6 months after we had them fixed and to top it all off  the molding around the windows inside the car is falling off  This has happened all in one year and the car was fully inspected by MY mechanic the day we bought it  which turned out as an A  inspection  So  needless to say after  1 406 59 later  the car is still developing things wrong or defective  not to mention a nice recall on some of the car s interior parts  which I have to have fixed  UGHH  Can we say HEADACHE  Never will I buy a Ford again br br
