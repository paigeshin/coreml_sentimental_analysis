 I bought my ford Tempo about two years ago   Since then it has driven 20 000 miles more or less   I bought this car because I needed a car to commute 50 miles to school in   So after some haggling my father bought me my Ford Tempo GL at a used car lot   My car has not given me as much trouble as I thought it was going to   So far I have replaced the alternator   the brakes   the battery and done basic maitanence   I hope that this car will hold out for another year   but that is not guaranteed   I feel like a ton of things are about to wrong with it   I recommend this car to commuters on a budget   I do not recommend this car if you want to pick up chicks   its not a very attractive car
