 I will never buy a Ford Windstar again  Mine has been in the shop nine times for transmission work or front end work  As for the transmission  it shifts hard going into second gear  Ford told me this is normal on the Windstar  Every time I took the van in  they would do minor adjustments and give it back to me with the van still shifting hard  A month after the warranty went out the transmission went out completely  It took me threatening to take them to court before they finally fixed the transmission  I have four friends who have bought Windstars and three of them are having the same problem with their transmission  I am also having problems with the front end  I have been talking to a man that works on vehicles and he has informed me that the Windstar has three problems  One  Transmissions  Two  front end alignment problems  three gasgets on the engine  Two of the three I have had problems with  Ford has earned its reputation  Fix or repair daily br br
