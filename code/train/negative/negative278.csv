 This is probably a dangerous time to write a review since my check engine light just came on again  but I have finally been provoked to dole out some public disdain for the current sedan offerings from Ford  especially after a recent spike in expensive repairs on my Torridor Red Ford Contour GL  As with many people  I found the contour to be a good handling  fun to drive car  and it came at a price too good to pass up  about  12 800 with everything a college student could use  Power mirrors  door locks  A C  an interesting but chintzy cup holder  all for the aforementioned low price  I purchased the Contour to complement the 1967 Mustang that I had inherited from my father thinking that it would reliably serve my needs as I commuted to College and began working after graduation  Little did I anticipate that my 67  Mustang would be of so much use to me over the next five years as my only working car not scheduled for maintenance  I have about 102 000 miles on my Contour  and only keep it because I have finally set up the suspension and wheels tires just right to out corner unsuspecting BMW drivers on the 110 freeway in Los Angeles  There is no cheaper car on the road that can handle corners better than my Contour  and that helps keep my wallet open and me under the car or visiting my dealer  But sometimes love just isn t enough  especially when it is so confined to the cornering ability of my modified car  The brakes are disc drum and fade at the hint of being used for spirited driving  which isn t too much of a concern unless going down hill  because they usually cool off by the time the under powered engine can get the car to the next corner that requires braking  I am out accelerated by everything  The four cylinder engine needs a lighter car to pull around than it s assigned  mid sized  Contour chassis  The SVT would have better suited me  but it was too much money for my budget and still carried over the same cheap looking interior  In search of some performance  I have tried an open element air filter and Flowmaster exhaust  which did help a little  but were too loud for me as I reached my mid twenties  Searching for a quieter upgrade  I use tires that are a little bit smaller than stock to keep the revs slightly higher  I contest that the real nightmare for Contour owners is not the interior plastics quality that is more of an annoyance and embarrassment  or the adherence to the standard Ford recipe for another overweight under powered car to add to their lineup of tubby cars and RV like SUV 146s  but the real threat is the consistent lighting of the check engine light along with other various failures that I didn t expect before 100 000 miles  The light is annoying in its frequency of attack  and it has been reset two dozen times already as technicians have tried to fix re occurring problems by replacing one part at a time  To make matters worse  it comes on and then goes out leaving me wondering if it just burned out from over use  Technicians cannot use the computer to pinpoint the problem when the light is out because it was told to me that the error code stored in the computer goes away unless the light has been on very recently  The short list of unscheduled maintenance and expensive repairs is as follows  Manual transmission failed and was replaced with the clutch  catalytic converter failed and blocked exhaust  oxygen sensor wire became loose and prompted hundreds of dollars in unnecessary repair before it was found  rear window rain seal has been replaced five times and keeps coming off  both front wheel bearings have been worn out and replaced  windshield cracked when car was washed in the sun  Other annoyances include the many recalls on this vehicle  the creaks and vibrations in the dash and rear side door  lack of rear legroom in such a large car  This is the last Ford that I will buy because I have read too many stories reporting that these problems are not isolated to the Contour line and because I dislike the feeling that I have put too much money into performance products for a car that will just fall apart in the next few years  I think that most of my problems occurred just after the 60 000 mile warranty had expired  just as Ford marketing had planned the Contour to be removed from the US  The Contour will never be a proper sports sedan as the ad campaign had suggested it would be  and I only wished that I had realized this many years ago and sold it while it was worth  5000  I hope that pesky check engine light won t cost too much to get fixed this time
