 In all fairness to Ford and people who rated the Focus highly  I rated mine on a rental car  It was a basic model  with automatic trans  but plain interior  Perhaps the one I rented wasn t typical of all models  Also  I tend to base my opinion about cars on my 1990 Toyota Camry  and this is probably unfair to American car manufacturers  read that anyway you want b Some positives about the car b I liked the size of the car   very compact b  but with ample room for up to four people  The front seats had plenty of headroom due to the high profile of the car The  trunk was exceptionally large  for a car this size The car  turned around in literally no space at all b  It has a very tight turning radius Gas mileage appeared to be very good  but I didn t actually keep track b The things I didn t like b First of all  who in Ford gets paid to style these things  Maybe it s just not my cup of tea  but I think  the style  to quote my 12 year old  sucks b The car was quiet enough in the city  but on the road  Getouttahere  New York construction sites are quieter  I heard that  droning road noise b  especially from the rear  long enough to put me in a straight jacket The dash board looks like Ford had stock in a plastics company  Maybe the bulk was supposed to impress me   but it looked downright ugly b  The high rear deck caused me problems when looking in the rear view mirror b Road handling on the highway didn t impress me b  It had minimal pickup and I didn t care for the road feel  I kept the car at around 70 mph  and it seemed to be straining to go faster  The Focus seemed to wander too much and not give me a firm steering feel I didn t find the dash buttons  door locks  radio controls  etc  to be exceptional  In fact  the radio seemed to have two volume positions  off and loud  There was no in between  and with today s rock that I had to listen to for hours  well  I think you know my feelings b Bottom line b  the car simply didn t math up to my 1990 Toyota Camry in any category  In fact  if I were making a choice in buying a low price car  I would look to a 1997 Camry or Honda for a much better value
