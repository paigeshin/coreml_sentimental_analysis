 I ve had my Ford Explorer now since 1993  It s been every where from Washington DC to Miami  FL  where it was purchased  to Alabama and now here to sunny  yeah right  San Diego  I must say that it would have been cheaper renting a car during my long travels rather then pay for the repairs on my Ford  Two months after I first purchased the vehicle  I had to call  quot road side assistance quot  because of a dead battery  When I went to the Ford dealership to find out what was wrong with the vehicle  they told me that the battery was old  OLD  HUH  Two months is OLD  Come to find out  the manufacture put a 1991 battery  that was probably sitting around in some warehouse begging for a sucker  that s me  to get stuck with him  in my 1993 vehicle  Oh but the fun s only beginning My Ford Explorer  29 000 miles young needs what  You guessed it  tires  At 135 dollars a pop  guess ole  Firestone loved that  WRONG manufactures defect on the tires  the treads were separating with no signs of normal wear and tear  Joyous  something free for a change 34 000 miles young ahhh  you need a new starter  we have a re call on your side mirror  something about catching on fire  blah blah blah  and low and behold  you need not only new brake pads  but the entire brake system needs replacing  for you southern Californian s  I guess it s what Brake Depot would call a  quot break system nightmare quot  Well  at least it was still under warranty  but boy are the mechanics at Ford and I becoming close friends Bare with me  quot auto experts quot  if I don t explain something adequately  You know us woman brake shoes shoulder pads  what s the difference  right smile  All right on to the 36 000 mile mark what  New tires AGAIN  And a muffler  etc  etc  and so on  Seems as though the older Ford Explorer models have front alignment problems which cause the tires to wear uneven  etc  So that lifetime alignment I purchased  the up keep on the alignment  rotation  oil changes  fuel injector cleanings  etc  etc  really haven t helped MUCH in the long run  The biggest problem with having something go wrong with your Ford   for those of you who drive Explorers  I m sure you ll agree  the Explorer would NOT start would not start long enough for me to drive it ANY WHERE It dies where it dies just the towing expenses alone would have been horrible if it hadn t been covered under my insurance On to the grand finale at 65 000 miles  still  young  I had the pleasure of experiencing a Ford transmission failure  unfortunately I was in the process of driving when it happened   1 800 00 dollars to re vive my Ford  hard parts soft parts  you name it my transmission needed it  Now  I know that in order to maintain the driving performance on your vehicle  you have to service it and take care of it  but in my case  I ve basically bought enough parts to build a brand new Explorer over the past 7 years  I know that 7 years seems like a long time  but the majority of this work was done during the first three years of my little guy s life  I would DEFINITELY not recommend someone purchasing an older model Explorer  did I mention the fact that I ve had my tires replaced 8 TIMES  I ve heard some really great stories from friends who have the newer Explorers  but because of all of the problems that I ve had with this little  quot baby quot  I wont be trading him in for a newer model  I might just try my luck with a Honda br br
