 Okay  I m not totally anti Ford Explorer  They re decent cars  And I think the Firestone tire thing is not a major concern  But the 2000 and 2001 Explorer doesn t handle as well as other cars in its class  namely the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Nissan Pathfinder  It s just no comparison  Maybe it s the  quot one body quot  thing  Explorer is put together from different parts rather than molded from one piece of steel  All I know is  my 2000 Explorer  which I sold after 3 months  can t touch my new 2001 Pathfinder  nor my 1998 Jeep  which I leased before the Explorer And there were other problems  For instance  there was a lot of rattling  Whenever I got out of the car after driving  I could here all sorts of  quot pings quot  and other noises  But the car was  supposedly  in excellent shape  And it drove okay  but I constantly felt like I was driving a big truck  and would flip on quick turns   not so on the Pathfinder  or the new Jeeps  or more expensive SUVs  except the Mercedes Explorers have some major positives  Keyless entry is great  And the headlights are incredibly bright  which is a nice thing if you live in a rural area  But the Jeep s computer and the Pathfinder s better stereo and related features  see my Pathfinder review  more than make up for those loses If you have a good deal on a used or new Explorer  I am not saying to definitely pass it up  I would just check out the Pathfinder and Jeep   and drive them all  a lot  around curves  on the interstate  before you pick one  On SUVs  handling is the most important thing  i e  does it feel like a car or a truck  and I think Explorers finish last in their class br br
