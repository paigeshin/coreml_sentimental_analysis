 I am a Mother of 3 small children who decided the time had come to purchase a minivan  After reading as many car magazines as I could get my hands on I narrowed the search to the Ford Windstar SEL  and the Honda Odyssey EX  Both of these models were new for 1999 and they were the only ones who offered automatic doors  a seemingly great feature for a mother with small kids  At the time the Windstar had a 5 star safety rating  the Odyssey was not rated  The Windstar was readily available  the Odyssey had a 6 week wait  The Windstar was a nicer looking vehicle  I purchased the Windstar It did not take long for me to realize that I had made a terrible mistake  When we picked up the vehicle  we noticed the door did not close flush to the vehicle  The service department repaired it  One month later  the car battery died while picking up carpool  back to the service department  Since that time I have been to the service department for a rear view mirror falling off  the gas gauge not being accurate  the door molding falling off  and a clicking noise from the steering column  These however  are only the problems that they repaired  To this day  the vehicle at times exhibits a  quot surging quot  sensation when going from drive to reverse or vice versa that they can not fix  In addition  the automatic doors are a HUGE safety concern  The Ford dealers will tell you that the automatic doors retract automatically if there is something in the way  What they don t tell you is that you need to exhibit force against the door for it to do this  For an adult this can be done  although I have been bruised before  however a small child can easily be injured  In addition  the buttons for the automated doors are located within reach of a child  This makes for a fun toy for the child and a nightmare for the parent  You may think I was unfortunate to get a lemon  However  I have searched the internet and have found a high number of other Windstar owners who are experiencing the same problems that I have encountered  I have also read of other owners having the front wheel fall off  many electrical problems  and I read of a child who s foot was badly injured from the doors  If you are considering purchasing this vehicle I suggest you visit www cartrackers com and www edmunds com  Look through the forums and town halls and you will be amazed at the number of unhappy Windstar owners I should also mention that Ford Motor Company has one of the worst customer service departments that I have ever come across  If you want to speak to a supervisor you have to wait for them to call you  and if you are not home you are just out of luck   case closed The Windstar may be nice looking inside and out  but remember  looks aren t everything br br
