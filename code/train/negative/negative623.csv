 We got our second escort a few years ago  but i m not exactly sure why  They are very light  but the engines are not very strong  If you get four or five full grown people in the car  it definately struggles going up big hills  It seems very much like a golf cart in the way that it feels and drives  It zooms around town and handles well  but it isn t anything special  some of the advantages are that it is very reasonably priced and it has very good gas efficiency so it is pretty cheap to keep running  This car is good for someone in a city who will not have much to lug around nor have many passengers to drive around
