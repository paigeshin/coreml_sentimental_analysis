 The Ford Mustang  My husband s dream car   quot I really want this car quot  he says   Yes  I m sure you do  So I  dutiful spousal unit that I am  re arranged our family budget to include the extra insurance and payment that would trail the joyous ownership of such a car  And so it was that he left one day and came home with a flashy hunter green Mustang   Such a pretty car  Well  it was pretty until this one certain woman my husband is married to accidentally ripped off the driver side door  Yes  we are still married   quot After all what is insurance for quot  says he  Indeed Unlike many men with new vehicular toys  my husband actually tried to encourage me to drive his car  He wanted me to like it as much as he did so he could justify the expense and claim that I used it as much as he did  However  at the time I had my own broomstick  a Ford F150 4x4 Flareside truck  I had no interest in his puny car  but I did drive it once in a while when he stole my truck  and following is a summary of that I think of this vehicle The FORD MUSTANG GT comes with a very powerful V 8 engine  manual 5 speed transmission  you can get them in automatic  however you will get less mpg  power doors seats mirrors  dual airbags  dual lighted vanity mirrors  rear shoulder harnesses  driver and passenger bucket seats  fully adjustable power driver side seat  air conditioning  and lots of other nifty little extra features that any self respecting car should sport  The glove compartment in the front passenger side contains the trunk popping mechanism  and the center console has a nice divided change holder and cassette cd holder thingie  Everything is pretty much within arms reach while driving  In spite of the positive points and pure flash value  I did not enjoy driving this vehicle and actually avoided it  I found that the bucket seats put me far too close to the ground  and I felt like I was in the cockpit of an airplane trying to peek out over the dashboard   Yeah  as if I have ever sat in the cockpit of an airplane  I felt unsafe and nervous because I could not see very well behind me  around me  or even in front of me  The tiny mirrors did not help matters much at all  Had we installed a  quot wink quot  mirror  I probably would have felt better about driving the car  but we never got around to that because my husband liked it just fine  he is much taller  though  and does not find his nose hitting the dashboard  and he mainly drove it The 5 speed manual transmission shifted fairly smoothly  but the gears seemed to be very close together  This was not a problem for me  because I have been driving manual transmissions since I was 14  My dad used to own a racetrack  and I even drove his old 3 speed on the column H pattern trash truck for him  Most young people these days have never even heard of one of those  But those close gears could make missing a gear easy for inexperienced manual transmission drivers  so I would practice on an old VW bug before driving this type of car if you have not had a lot of practice with clutches and gears  The gas mileage we got was about 18 mpg in the city  and a bit more on the freeway  Not good  but not horrendous either  Additionally  insurance rates are pretty high for this type of vehicle  as you can well expect  My insurance company  USAA  put out a book which rated the safety level of most of the popular cars  and the MUSTANG did not score very well in any category  despite the dual airbags and anti lock brakes  I am sure there are many reasons for this  but the fact that the vehicle is capable of great speed probably contributes While the leg area was very ample and could easily accommodate my husband s 6 3 frame  the seats were very narrow  My chunky lil bootie just barely fit comfortably  A very large hipped person would not be able to fit in those seats  and if they did manage to squeeze in they would have the seatbelt latch digging into their outer thighs  Additionally  the back area is so small that only very small adults or children 12 and under can really ride in any semblance of comfort  My son had to lay down in back when he rode in this car  Needless to say when my husband and I went out with our oldest son  I got stuck hunkering in the back  After a while  I just stayed home Acceleration is  needless to say  very fast  This car reminded me of a song by the band ALABAMA called  quot I m in a Hurry quot  A line in the song goes   quot my car s not new but it ll zero to sixty in 5 2 quot  While that figure may not be accurate for the MUSTANG  it probably comes close  I found myself speeding every single time I drove this car  because you simply do not realize how fast you are going  I had to constantly be on my guard  One time I realized I was doing 80 mph in a 45 zone  YIKES  Another thing don t buy these cars in red  especially if you have a lead foot  unless you set up a separate speeding ticket fund  They are cop magnets for some reason  The dark  inconspicuous color of my husband s car probably saved us both from numerous tickets The Ford Mustang corners like there is no tomorrow  The low center of gravity and wide wheel base helps the car hug the road on even the sharpest corners  Again  however  this can lead to disaster when drivers become over confident and misjudge either the sharpness of the corner  their own ability to control the car  or both  Follow the suggested speed limits on corners at all times  especially in this car  because it is easy to loose control when you go 90 mph on a 20 mph curve  I would recommend this car to responsible singles and couples  It is not  in my opinion  a good family vehicle  even though a car seat would fit in the back  I would not transport my baby in this car if I had another choice  There are too many safer cars on the market  This car is NOT  in ANY WAY  suitable for teenagers or inexperienced drivers  The combination of hormones  inexperience  and speed are often deadly  Likewise  it is not suitable for very elderly drivers who may suffer from vision impairment  slow reflexes  or distance judgment  or ANY driver with such impairment for that matter  Shortly after I ripped the driver side door off  Don t EVEN ask how  HAHHAHA  we traded the Mustang and a deathtrap Plymouth Grand Voyager  see my review on that hay wagon  toward a 2000 Ford Excursion  and I sold my truck  We had 3 cars  and not a single one of them was a safe  large  reliable vehicle for a family of 6  I felt bad about my husband s dream car flying the coop  but I had to relinquish my truck as well  so my sympathy level diminished rapidly  The needs of the many definitely outweighed the need of the few  Anyone know how to kill a Vulcan for coining that phrase br br
