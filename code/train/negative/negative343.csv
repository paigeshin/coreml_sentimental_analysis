 What is white  not black  and red all over  ME  After being struck head on in a collision while driving at least 35 mph  I  Klaxonman  a Caucasian male  became red all over   Red from blood  There is absolutely no need for such large vehicles  they only spell trouble  While the driver of these cars may be safe  are the people driving the sedans  No  Not at all  I suffered at least three broken bones in my rib cage  and I lost quite a bit of blood from cuts due to shattered glass  Had a smaller vehicle hit me head on  the result may have been a bit different  Another poor aspect of such large SUV s is the fact that they are gas guzzlers  Virtually any sedan will get mileage that is twice as efficient as the Expedition  That will cut your gas bills two fold What I am trying to say is  don t just think about yourself when purchasing such a large vehicle  think of the other drivers on the road  While this review may not relate to the specific car  I hope this may sway your decision of purchasing a tank of a car  Do you need a lot of room in your car  Try a mini van  Having trouble handling in rugged terrain  There are plenty of 4 wheel drive vehicles which come at a much lower price and a much smaller size  Before you decide to purchase the expedition  just think of these two points  1  Large SUV s are much more dangerous to other drivers than sedans 2  You will be saving a lot of money in purchasing a smaller vehicle With that said  what advantages that the Expedition may have can outweigh the disadvantages of purchasing of such a large car  I think the choice is easy br br
