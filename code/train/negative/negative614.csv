 I recently went out and test drove one of these puppies  and here are a few random thoughts I had from this experience In the event of a head on collision  the car s engine is designed to separate for the car s frame and drop to the ground  I guess consumers don t take too highly to being crushed by the engine It s a snug fit  There is very little space between the seat and the door  The armrest is a stand alone console between the driver and passenger seats  and has a good amount of storage space for CDs and other things The back seat has very little legroom  and is a bit cramped  Even if the front seat person moves the seat forward  very little room is yielded   There are special child seat restraints and three seatbelts in the back  Not exactly a huge family vehicle  but equipped with child safety locks  and other amenities Really good power  for such a tiny little car  Surprising  in fact  You step on the gas pedal  and it moves  Handles very good around corners Speaking of corners  what is that loud clicking sound  Oh It s just the turn signal  I guess Ford wants to help eliminate those annoying motorists who drive 6 miles down the road before realizing their blinker has been on the whole time  Since the turn signal is about as loud as a Mark McGwire home run swat  I would say they are well on their way to accomplishing this goal All the doors automatically lock once the car exceeds 5 MPH Very good vision when driving  You cannot see the hood of the car  The wind shield affords a wide view  There is a moderate amount of noise  and you may have to turn up the radio just a bit when accelerating to higher speeds The clutch is very easy to push down on  and transitioning from one gear to other is very smooth with the exception of reverse  It was quite a task to put the vehicle in reverse  You almost have to lift up on the gear stick  It took about a minute and a half to figure this out the first time  and about 30 45 seconds to do each time after that There is no RPM gauge  Only this annoying light that comes on  telling you when to shift up or down  and usually at the slightest amount of acceleration  I guess Ford thinks I m not smart enough to know when to shift The car gets pretty good gas mileage  at 25 34 MPG  but I would expect more from such a small car This car has a lot of truck space  although its much longer than it is deep  When loading the truck  you really have to come forward into the trunk  rather than placing objects down into it  There is a hatch release lever inside that  VERY useful if you are ever car jacked  and forced into the trunk  while the robber makes his getaway  The back seats also pull down in a 1 3  2 3 configuration for added capacity Overall this is not a bad car  but at a price of about 17 grand  it is WAY over priced  I see this car as the exact duplicate of what the Escort used to be when it first came out  If you are looking for a car that will get you to where you re going  then this will do  But the price tag is just offensive  and was the main reason we did not buy
