 I have the misfortune of having purchased one of these vehicles about a year and a half ago  It is a 1993 Taurus Wagon  Top of the line  fully loaded  black and very pretty to look at  Unfortunately  I have only been able to drive the car for about 5 000 miles since I purchased it  First the steering went out  900  next it was the head gasket   1 700  not to mention various other minor repairs  The last tow truck driver informed me that he tows the Ford Taurus more often than any other car and the garage concurred  I was warned that the transmissions often go out in these cars and  alas  that prediction came true yesterday  I have decided to donate the car to charity  I would not recommend this car to anyone br br
