 This car defines average  There s a reason why it s one of the most widely used cars for fleets  Skim the other reviews and see how many of these people actually own one of these cars  Fleet managers love this car because it is well rated in crash tests  rather reliable and doesn t inspire illegal  surges  in speed  My 2000 is also a fleet vehicle  ours is the second company it has served  HP took delivery of this car first  Now don t get me wrong  I d have driven a used Yugo if the company determined that was what they wanted me to have  I m grateful that we went to a medium sized car  But I do have a few complaints  not as many as I d have if I were forced to drive a used Yugo  The initial visit to the local dealer was interesting  They pulled the service history from their computers and found they had about a dozen recall actions to perform  Oh  things like the fuel pump  pedals too close together  windshield wipers  alternator a whole range of things  I admire Ford for fixing all these things for free  but did Microsoft purchase them  Perhaps the Taurus  it goes through a complete makeover every couple of years  uses the summer intern design teams  I received the car with around 18 000 miles  I m not certain why HP got rid of it so early but I ve a few ideas  At about 75 000 now  the leak started about 20 000 miles ago  Oil is leaking from somewhere in the vicinity of the passenger s side headlight  I ve a slick in my garage to show for it  No one seems to know what it is that is leaking there  It started with an odor of burning oil  No clue and company policy seems to be to leave the car alone unless it s something affecting safety  Uh kay  The ride around town is fine  Stiff enough to give the impression someone on the car s design team knew someone who was once hooked up with someone who designs sports cars  Perhaps with a designer on the Mustang design team  Power is decent but not inspiring  I drive this car up to 3500 miles per month as a salesman for a relatively small company  Long drives to various prospects and clients scattered about Iowa are made less comfortable by that stiff suspension  You can count expansion joints in the road through the seat  steering wheel  pedals  etc  Frost heaves are another thing entirely  For the  16 000 the company paid for this car I could have bought sorry  off topic Handling is also good in the sense that when you turn the wheel to the left the car agrees that is a good direction to go and doesn t fight you in doing it  It is good to obey the posted curve speeds as the tires protest too much if speeds are pushed  The side bolsters on the seats are enough to keep you from finding too many alternate pressure points on your gluteus  and padding thereof  but not enough to keep you firmly centered under hard cornering  The dead pedal is where you d expect it to be if your vehicle is so small as to have the front wheel wells encroach on the passenger cabin  The upholstery is light gray  Stone  Perhaps medium vanilla gray is the best description  The dashboard is laid out fairly well but I think the tachometer was put there to aesthetically balance the speedometer  There are also many  decorative  little nooks and ledges to gather extra road dust  The blower knob no longer sticks where it is supposed to stick  It makes occasional lunges for freedom managing to get as far as the floor  rolling about as far as the center of the driver s seat  It eludes a casual reach so I ve to stop and fish it out to readjust the blower motor  I d much rather have a thermostat but I guess Taurus drivers aren t sophisticated enough for that sort of feature  HP cars have an option that wasn t available to the general public  or so I ve read  The center console can be folded up under the center armrest  I guess so you can have someone in the front as well as the back sit on the nearly rock solid center and  in the front  almost on the driver s lap  Anyway  when this is down you ve two decent cup holders and a place to mount and connect a cell phone  While connected the phone charges its battery   makes use of the car s external cell phone antenna  To answer you press a button above the rear view mirror  The stereo then cuts off and you hear the conversation over the car s audio system  Neat  but the little cradle to hold your cell phone is  450 and specific to each brand  Not that neat  I ll stick to my Jabbra  Normally  according to the owner s manual  where the cell phone mounts in this car is another bin  The center bin is a nice place to keep tapes   whatever other little items you need to keep close at hand while driving  It also collects stray potato chip crumbs  peanut M Ms  etc  Bins are also built into all the doors  You ve also got the large   deep pockets on the front seat backs that are good for holding marketing material  I m not certain what the rest of you use these for  The glove is of the bin variety tipping out at the top  versus tipping out at the bottom and dumping the contents onto the floor  Anyway  it manages to hold the manuals  a bottle of Tylenol  an economy size of Tums and some extra pens  full at that point and difficult to close  I prefer the old style where the glove was fixed with a door rather than this tipping bin  There is an extra power port just to the right of the ashtray  The lighter is directly above and to the right of a totally worthless cubby  Perhaps an engineer designed this  as that matching doesn t really make sense to me  a lowly salesman  About that cubby  nothing seems to stay within other than items too small to make it worthwhile  I have a picture of my wife   I in there now  Under extreme conditions even the picture slides out  Cell phone  Forget it  Just backing out of the drive way sends it skipping to the floor  With two power points I can plug in my phone and my vibrating seat cushion   I do like gadgets that work  I keep business cards in the ashtray  Headroom is very good   even with my seat cushion   in the driver s seat  I haven t spent too much time in the back seat  If that is good or bad you tell me  The general consensus though is that the back seat is a bit cramped  I drove three staff members of a prospective client four hours one way  and back again  and didn t anesthetize the two in the back sufficiently  Combine that with my testosterone induced marathon driving style and I really don t need to tell you we didn t get the business  Next time I ll rent a van or luxury car   perhaps with a wet bar  One interesting feature is the pedal adjustment  Ford  I believe  developed this for those of you who need the seat all the way back to fit behind the steering wheel but then can t reach the pedals  The car has a switch on the left of the driver s seat that runs a motor that moves the pedal assembly closer or further depending upon your starting point and the direction you push the switch  duh  It has quite a range of motion  I ve a 34  inseam and have never had a desire to move the pedals beyond the hour I first brought this car home  This is a gadget I ve no use for  Perhaps it was intended for the one million chimps typing randomly on typewriters to get to work   long arms and short legs  I do like the stereo  For some reason it is able to pull radio stations in for some distance further than my GM cars normally have  Beyond that it is also rather average for sound  The bass doesn t thump  This car also doesn t have the available CD changer  When the CD button is pressed on the stereo the display scrolls  NO DJ  Bless his heart  isn t that just cute  Whatever  The interior sound level is rather nice  No squeaks or rattles to mention  Those are the kind of things that some members of society put other people in the trunk to check for  normally people who owe them large sums of money  They then drive to a remote location and ask them if they heard the rattle too  When they blubber incoherently the driver understandably gets mad and  Sorry  off topic again  I also like the key fob remote   very nice gadget  Press the unlock button once and the driver s door unlocks  Twice and all the doors unlock  Trunk release is very nice when running out to grab this or that  Why do these things occasionally have an  EMERGENCY  button  I ve noticed them on Ford   Chrysler products  key fobs  How many of you accidentally hit it when your neighbor is checking out your car in the driveway while you re inside the house  Can I see some hands  It only works to test the bladder once  The trunk is big enough to swallow most of what I need to carry  You can fold the rear seats down to give you  more room  but it has to be very narrow and short  Skis would fit as well as extra long golf clubs  I don t have either  That s about all that feature is good for except maybe if someone were to carry 8  boards home from the lumberyard  I guess if you need to carry up to four 8  2 x 4 pieces of lumber at a time this would be a good feature  Understand that these boards would selfishly hog all your armrest  too  They d also make quite a mark on the dash if you were to run into something The spare is of the doughnut variety and located under the floor of the trunk  Normally you don t need to access that too often  but I ve had to  Twice  Praise the Lord  both days were otherwise pleasant enough that it wasn t a huge chore  However  there is a six foot long bolt holding the spare in place  Okay  perhaps more like six inches  I normally don t exaggerate length  but it feels much longer while bent awkwardly into the trunk with demo cases scattered behind me  That s the other thing  I didn t care to have the flat in contact with anything that was in the trunk and the donut hole  is that what you d call that  isn t large enough to store a full size flat  Fortunately all that was on the tire was black brake dust and road grime  it s not like I m herding horses with it or anything  I wrapped the tire in the blanket I keep in the trunk for emergencies  Great  now I ve got black brake dust on my emergency blanket  One occasion that prompted a tire change was when I hit a rather nasty pothole and actually punctured the aluminum rim  Not just a bend  It actually tore a hole in it and air was leaking not just from the tire bead but also from the rim  The tire had also had a bad day understand  but not near as bad as that rim  Anyway  I was amazed and began to wonder what a replacement might cost   150   200  no   350  That s  1400 for the set of four  I could get a very fancy set on e Bay for okay  back to topic  The Ford garage admitted that the aluminum rims are rather soft and that s not as uncommon as I would have thought  You know  I didn t even get to keep the old rim  That would have been quite a chunk of aluminum to bring in for scrap  I could have defrayed the cost a bit  eh  Oh  topic  topic  An area most manufacturers cut weight now is on the brake rotors  Someone at HP either rode the brake a great deal or that pothole also bent the rotor  I ve a really nasty shimmy shake when braking hard from Interstate speeds  Not enough to be dangerous of course  but extremely annoying  Fuel economy is disappointing  I d assume and be incorrect that this medium sized car would get better fuel economy than my land yacht  92 Buick Roadmaster  Taurus 23 highway  20 city  Roadmaster 25 highway  18 city  If the difference in comfort weren t so extreme it wouldn t bother me as much  This is also the EVO model engine  It will run happily on  environmentally friendly fuels  I ve only seen one station with a 95  ethanol option and that is about four hours north  I d have expected it to run better on the alternative fuel  but it got the same mileage on the slightly more expensive fuel  The paint  white of course  and exterior finish are well done  I ve noted earlier models that took a bad primer coat and most of the paint has flaked off the hood and roof of the cars  Ford seems to have fixed that issue  I guess what this comes down to is that the Taurus has some design and mechanical quirks without the redeeming factors some other cars possess  If your Ferrari has a stiff ride  you know it s because it s a sports car  If your old VW microbus leaks a bit of oil from strange places  you accept that as part of the vintage  But this  for me anyway  is just too vanilla a car  Update 11 Dec 03   Okay folks  As mentioned above this vehicle has the adjustable pedals  Fine  There is a solenoid on the brake pedal that tells the car when the pedal is depressed  presumably so it can administer valium  Why this is engineered this way is a mystery  but to save thousands of dollars in wire over the manufacturing life of the car the two wires that connect to the pedal are just barely long enough to reach that solenoid when the pedals are set all the way forward to the firewall  When you push the brake pedal when it is set in that far  forward  position  I ve a 34  inseam  those wires bend at the solenoid  Are you following this  Over time copper loses strength when bent back   forth  back   forth    Keep that in mind  I was purchasing food at a local quick service restaurant sitting in front of their drive up window  I d put the car into park as it was taking some time to harvest the potatoes for the fries and kill the chicken to prepare my sandwich  yes  it took that long  When I went to leave I moved to pull the stalk into the drive position  But  since you need to depress the brake pedal to shift the transmission from park to another selection  really not a bad idea  and the aforementioned weakness of copper had resulted in an electrical fault that resulted in the car not being able to know when the brake was depressed  Incidentally  this also handles all the brake lights as well  So  the solenoid no longer was connected to the rest of the system that UN locks the transmission stalk  I can t even get into neutral to push it out of the way of the other folks who want to purchase food as well  Did I mention that it was 5 00 pm  So  it takes 5 minutes to figure out that I will not be able to muscle this into drive or at least neutral  The store manager is leaning out the window making suggestions  Nothing I tried would work  I called my personal mechanic  He d never heard of this happening  we didn t know the solenoid was disconnected  ever  I called a tow   waited for 20 minutes  Now it s around 5 30 pm  did I mention it was Friday night  and the tow truck is trying to hook up to the car  He s never heard of such a thing as this before either  In the wait I ve discovered the wire has disconnected from the solenoid  I ve the tow truck driver hold a flashlight while I attempt to reconnect the wire to the solenoid  In a short time I also discover that the wire is a bit short  I figure this out by reversing my seating position in the car  My feet are up by the ceiling and my arms and head are wedged into the foot well  I manage to push the wire into the solenoid and un wedge myself  Still doesn t work  The tow truck drops my car at my mechanic s garage  he waited for me to get there  Fortunately I ve a good relationship with my mechanic   he s able to squeeze this little project in the next day  He added two inches to both wires  the second wire was about ready to go as well  and now there s a little slack to the wires so they re not strained to the limit  Have I mentioned my food was cold
