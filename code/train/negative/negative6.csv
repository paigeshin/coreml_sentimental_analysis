 We bought this van in 1999  after having been a rental since it s  birth  Initially we loved it  It was everything we had dreamed about and more  There was plenty of room for 7 and rode extremely nice  even in the very back  We had heard nothing but good about this van  it s safety ratings  ease of driving  etc  It was the GL model  and had rear heat air and stereo controls  The front seats were bucket  while the two in back were bench  Everything about it was wonderful UNTIL We had around 70 000 miles on it and the transmission went out of it  Things seemed to roll downhill from there  We replaced the tranny and a few weeks later the interior of the sliding door fell off  It had constant problems with the ignition switch and was always dinging whether or not the keys were in it  the lights were on  whatever  The interior lights stayed on all the time as well  The door ajar light was always on  no matter what was done to ensure that all the doors were closed  No lie  a few times this van even started itself when the keys weren t even in it  The gas mileage was only about 17 18 mpg  The air conditioning would literally run you out it got so cold  We never did have any problems with the air or heat  It rode very nice  and drove very nice  but all in all  I d say it definately wasn t worth the money paid  and was more of a headache than it was worth
