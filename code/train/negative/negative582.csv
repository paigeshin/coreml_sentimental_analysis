 October 1997 I decide to get myself a new car  After driving heavy SUVs or Sedan  I thought I could switch to a smaller  more maneuverable  more economical and quicker car Well after little shopping around  big mistake  I bought a Ford Mustang because they gave me a great deal and more money than anybody else for my old 4WD  I first thought it was the best car because I had been used to drive older cars  The Mustang was new  clean  runned smoothly and quiet  and smelled NEW Then  I quickly realized that it was NOT a SPORT car at all  It certainly is a coupe with little room inside but the engine and chassis are far from being Sport car elements  With a too big and heavy 3 8l engine they only get 155 HP which is ridiculous above all considering the very heavy weight of the car  Too heavy to be a real sport car  This car needs a smaller and more efficient engine with at least 30 more horse powers and lighter material to lose about 500 lbs  Then you d start getting interesting results  Might also need a 6 speed instead of a 5  I definitely recommend choosing a stick if you want some kind of sensation so that you can go up in the RPMs and get a little power  The car max speed is alo limited electronically and usually varies between 115 and 120  Mine never went above 115mph  but considering how dangerous highways are and how many cops are out there  it is more tha enough  The competition just left the Mustang behind in the dust as far as performance is concerned and handling probably too  This car chassis is 10 or 15 year old  suspensions are more comfort than sport  and the weight also alters the handling  The camaro V6 has a lot more horse power  The Golf GTI is quicker  The Mitsubichi Eclipse is quicker and more economical  handles better  A great buy Inside the car is pretty nice and well organized  It is comfortable for a sport car unless you are above 6 2 quot  Then leg room is an issue in the front seats  IN the back  forget about the seats  you could barely fit a 14 year old  Might as well be no seats and more leg room in the front like in a MR2  My friend who is 6 5 quot  actually fits comfortably in his MR2  Access to the rear seats is not easy either  The base Mustang model comes with a lot of features  all power  alloy wheels  rear defrost  remote entry  CD player  Big mistake form Ford  not including floor mats  How cheap A few positive things about my 98 Mustang IT is economical  never had to fix anything  well the CD player went dead but the warranty took care of that  Gas mileage is great for a big V6  Basically  an oil change every 4 or 5 k miles it seems reliable  Except for that CD player  no visit to the mechanic Quality improved  The plastics used inside are not bad at all for a cheap car and it is assembled pretty well  No noises in the car even after 36k miles  Tires went slick fast though Quiet ride  for a sport car  it rides smoothly and is quiet  The seats are also more comfortable than average The price is low and the car looks good  it has a lot of standard features for the price including CD player  However  it DOES NOT DELIVER as a sport car  Just buy it for the looks or if you HAVE to own a Mustang Overall  it is a good ride but not a sporty one  At red lights  I could not even try to compete with most sedans like the ACCORD v6  MAzda V6  some pick ups  For Sport  if you have to own a MUSTANG  GET THE AMZINGLY POWERFUL V8 but then be careful because the chassis  suspensions will not tolerate driving mistakes  They are not good enough for that power plant and on the rain better stay under 2000 rpm  My husband bought a V8 after we sold the V6 and he loved the sensations I guess the Mustang v6 is a good car for a young driver as it is cheap and is not too quick I would not recommend it otherwise br br
