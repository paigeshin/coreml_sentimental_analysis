  Strengths   The Taurus has an excellent ride quality  With the upgraded suspension  it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car  The seats are comfortable and well supportive  and the controls  though some looking quite tacky  are in easy reach and easy to use  The gauges are goodsized and understandable  and the overall roominess is great   Weaknesses   It is equipped with the 3 0L Vulcan engine  and there s not too much good I can say about that  First  the car is very underpowered  It doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures  Also  under hard acceleration  the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly  quot refined quot  V 6  Also  the axle ratio on this car is extremely low  at around 3 90 1  This means it revs really high and not that high of a speed  Also  in overdrive  it hits about 2300 2400 rpm while cruising at 65mph  Our van only does about 1900 2000 at this speed  Also mechanically  I m not to impressed with the transmission on this car  When you accelerate real lazy  it shifts smooth out of first  When you give it about half throttle  it shifts pretty rough  But then  when you floor it  it shifts smooth again  Figure that one out  Also  when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed  it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on  Lastly  the design of this model year Taurus is pretty bad  It s way too  quot bubble shaped quot  as my girlfriend says  The circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision  and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors   Overall   I personally wouldn t really recommend this car to anyone especially if you look at other cars out there in this price range hondas  toyotas  etc  This definately isn t the greatest car Ford has ever built  It somewhat lacks in the quality department  Kind of ironic considering their slogan  quot Quality is Job 1 quot
