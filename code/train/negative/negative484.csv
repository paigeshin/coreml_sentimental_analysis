   Update 4 3 2002  I am downgrading this car to 3 stars   and will not recommend this car any longer  I have learned that there are four simultaneous government safety probes launched on this model  regarding such items as unintended airbag inflation  engine fires  and bad rear wheel bearings  There have also been eight recalls for the Focus  which I reflected in the reliability rating  I am also concerned with other Ford of Europe products  such as the bigger  Contour  and even the  Jaguar X Type   which were designed by the same folks and share much of the engineering and some parts  My Contour review has been downgraded accordingly i b Below is the original review from 2 22 2001  which I chose not to alter in any way despite the disturbing information above b I don t know why  but my Ford Contour seems to have a huge affinity for body shops  As soon as I brought it to Tucson from the harsh life of the San Francisco Bay Area  the car acquired another huge dent in the front fender   using the few drops of Bay Area gasoline left in its tank  it had been towed here  not driven  That meant I had to arrange yet another rental car for the duration of the repairs  of course after yelling out a few choice words on this final Bay Area curse  I was happy to pick up a brand new Cloud Nine White 2001 Ford Focus LX 4 door sedan  with a whopping 28 miles on the odometer  Although it differed significantly from the spunky ZX3 hatchback most of the other reviewers wrote about  I still found the car to be very pleasant b The Exterior  The exterior of the Focus has often been described as  love it or hate it  styling  It is very true   and for the most part  I love it  The very geometric shapes of the wheel well arches  the sharp and triangular headlights  and the fixed antenna mounted over the center of the car all served to give this car a personality  The Focus  developed in Europe just like my Contour  definitely looked the part  features like the center mounted radio antenna are very common in small European cars  and on the streets of Tucson where jellybean shaped Korean cars dominate  this car was a standout  Even the wheel covers on the standard 14  stock wheels looked decent  I must  however  say that the Focus sedan looks rather boring next to the sporty hatchback version b The Interior   Dashboard  The interior continued the exterior styling  with a dashboard full of asymmetric shapes and bold diagonal lines  interrupted by perfectly oval vents  Conventional would be the last thing to describe this dashboard  but I liked it  Although the dashboard was made entirely of hard plastic  it did not feel or look cheap  The instrument cluster was more conventional  and it was extremely easy to read  its legible letters  bright warning lights  and green backlighting bore a family resemblance to the boring yet legible instrument cluster in my Contour  Sadly  there was no tachometer in this bare bones LX  In the middle of the dashboard was a large emergency flasher switch  large and illuminated just like those on Volkswagens  Below it  a large  easy to use radio cassette player welcomed me  and even at low volume settings I could hear it clearly  although I felt quite some distortion at higher volumes  Below the radio was the climate control system  with separate A C and recirculation buttons and many options for airflow adjustment   just like the excellent systems in Japanese cars and Volkswagens  and a far improvement over the old fashioned controls of my Contour  And yes  the A C was very cold b The Interior   Seating  It took me a bit to get used to the driving position  but the seat was decent  The driver s seat adjusted for fore aft  seatback tilt  and seat height  I found that the seat somehow became more uncomfortable as I raised it  The seat did not hug me as well as my car s seat  but it supported me in the right places  From the seat it was easy to operate the controls  The steering wheel  while not as nice as the one in my Contour  was still good  with thickened grab points at 10 and 2 positions  and the turn signal and windshield wiper stalks were within easy reach  Next to the parking brake lever  I could even find a pen holder  I also tried the rear seat  and found plenty of headroom there  but legroom seemed a bit more cramped than my Contour  The seatback had a 60 40 split fold down feature  which was easy to use from the trunk  The trunk  with its high lid  was fairly spacious  but not deep  and thoughtfully it came with a fluorescent pull handle which trapped children and adults could use to escape   I trapped myself in the trunk just to test it out  and it was very easy to use  Even better for children  this car came with three child seat anchors above the rear seat   but on the other hand  the child lock switches are hidden deep inside the rear doors  and requires the key to flip b Performance  As the repairs to my Contour only took three days  I did not have too much of a time to check this Focus out on the road  Tucson s dead straight streets also offered little opportunity to test out the handling of the vehicle  Nevertheless  I drove around quite a bit  heading out of town to nearby mountain passes to watch the beautiful desert sunsets   and to test this car s cornering abilities  Although the steering did not feel as direct as my car s  it was still fairly sharp and responsive  and I could take mountain curves at 10 15 mph above recommended speeds without feeling the car lean into the corners  Too often I would find myself stuck behind a less nimble car  such as Kia Sephia  struggling just to maintain the recommended curve speed  On the other hand  I was not as happy with the powertrain  while the 2 0 liter SPI engine carried over from the Escort was adequate  the 4 speed automatic transmission was quite slushy and hesitant  By contrast  the ZX3 hatchback  reviewed by others here  inherited the more sophisticated Contour powertrain  including the more powerful Zetec engine  in the future I should drive a ZX3 for comparison  While driving  I found the visibility to be so so  the view to the rear felt somewhat limited  and the outside mirrors were smallish  At least the manual mirrors were very easy to adjust precisely  in other cars  manual mirrors tend to be too sensitive and finicky to adjust precisely  At night  headlights were fairly bright  both high and low b Workmanship Quality  It appeared that the car was very well put together  The paint seemed smooth  the interior materials seemed substantial  and I could not find a single rattle   but then  this was a brand new car  so it had better be quiet  Aside from a slightly damaged roofliner fastener  I saw no defects  I could hear some engine noise during acceleration  but otherwise the car was fairly quiet  Even the turn signal clicks were soft and synthesized   soothing enough to inspire a few poems  It seems that Ford strove to put the quality feel of a sophisticated European car into an inexpensive American built car  and it succeeded  On the other hand  this car also felt quite flimsy in many aspects  The way the hood and the doors closed and the way the car drove told me that despite what the Ford marketers may claim  the Focus is not a replacement for the Contour  Yes  this is a fantastic car  a superb replacement for the Escort and a formidable competitor to the likes of Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla   but this is still a smaller car  not in the league of bigger  heftier cars like VW Jetta  VW Golf  and Ford s own Contour  Yes  the Focus has more headroom than the Contour  but that is only because the Contour got saddled with a ridiculously low roofline b Pricing  As I put away my rental contract in the glovebox  I found the car s sticker  The sticker revealed that this vehicle was a stripped down base model  equipped with only automatic transmission and A C as options  The base price was in the ballpark of  12 500  and the particular vehicle I rented  after destination charge  was  14 400 MSRP  I think this is a bit too expensive  But then  Ford crammed lots of extras into this car as standard equipment  including a high quality cassette player  an electric  not cable  trunk release  fold down rear seats  power steering  and a large 2 0 liter engine to start with  True  I could find a car for less  but they would lack some of these features many people now take for granted  Besides  once I drop the  815 automatic transmission  even a loaded ZX3 hatchback with cruise control and power accessories could be had for the price of this lowly LX  and the top line ZTS sedan would still be under  16 000  I won t complain with this kind of pricing  And since the likes of carsdirect com sell the Focus at near invoice prices  the pricing will be even sweeter than these MSRP figures suggest b Verdict  Contrary to Ford s marketers  the Focus does not replace the Contour  But it is an outstanding replacement for the Escort  Although I was saddled with the rock bottom LX with lackluster powertrain  I still was able to enjoy the car s thoughtful features  European personality  and precise handling  I had driven a top line Focus ZTS last year on a closed track and was impressed then  and this base model did not disappoint me either Unfortunately  this car comes from a company that is mega obsessed with trucks  not cars  Visiting the Ford dealership where my car was repaired   and this rental was picked up   I could see hundreds of trucks and SUV s versus only two dozen passenger cars  Ford kept cheapening the Contour before killing it outright  and I am not sure how serious Ford is about this car either  I ve grown a strong dislike for Ford because of its role in creating and perpetuating the current SUV boom  and that will keep me away from the Focus  Unfortunately  at this price level  the only viable competitor seems to be Hyundai Elantra  another fantastic car from another company I hate  Of course  there is the option of buying Japanese or Volkswagen   but for a price
