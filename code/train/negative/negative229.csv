 And I thought quality was Job 1  HA At 40 000 miles I replaced head gaskets and had the transmission rebuilt in my 95 Windstar  Ten months ago at 72 000 miles the engine was replaced  This is to say nothing of brake jobs every 25 000 miles and numerous electrical problems   I won t bore you with a long defense  but in case you re wondering  this van is not driven hard Today I learned that the head gaskets must be replaced again but that I am 4 000 miles over the 12 month 12 000 mile warranty  Ford refuses to bend the rules  Now they expect me to invest more than  1000 in head gaskets that may last  what  maybe 10 000 miles maybe 25 000  The bottom line is that they know this engine is flawed and they can t figure out how to fix it and they won t stand behind it Take my advice  if anyone offers to sell  or even give  you one of these things run away screaming
