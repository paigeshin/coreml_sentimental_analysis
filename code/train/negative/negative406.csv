 I m a commercial Industrial HVAC service tech  The company I work for has quite a few Ford E 250 vans ranging from 1994 to 2001  I ve driven all including the  98 s  however my personal company vehicle is a  96  All vans are nearly identical First I ll start out with the good points The engine in my  96 E 250 is a 351 V8  not the Triton  This engine provides plenty of power in all situations  Acceleration is excellent and I have no problem burying the 85 mph speedometer  I would estimate top speed is around 100 mph In nearly 6 years 70 000 miles this van has NEVER failed to start on the first turn of the key whether it s 10 degrees below 0 or 110 degrees in the shade  So far no repairs other than regular maintenance have been done to the engine Gas mileage is excellent for this big loaded down van and with the large fuel tank I can go several days between fill ups The silver exterior paint clear coat finish is excellent  The van stays outside year round and goes into many hostile environments such as steal mills and construction sites yet after a quick wash looks new Cargo capacity is good  I have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets and there s still plenty of floor space for big equipment  I also believe the height of the cargo area is better than most other makes Very little wind noise The power steering is easy and quiet  The high back reclining bucket seats are very comfortable and durable  The heater is great even on the coldest days and the air conditioner does a really good job on the hottest days  The 4 speaker stereo sounds sweet  All accessory controls are clearly marked and easy to get at The dash layout is great  Speedometer  trip meter  fuel gauge are all easy to see  There s also temperature  oil pressure and volt gauges Now for the bad We ll start off with the minor stuff The styling yeesh  If you sent this van back to 1976 it would fit right in and wouldn t turn a single head Dash controls are cheap  To get the windshield washer to activate I have to hit the stalk hard several times  The plastic end of the gear select column  where the overdrive button is  was always flimsy and the stalk eventually broke off revealing wires and a small circuit board  also happened to one of our newer vans  Epoxy took care of that problem  The cup holder wore out quickly and the single thin plastic tab that actually supports your drink broke off for me today sending my bottle of Sobe into the storage compartment under it  The doors fit nicely  however the weather stripping on the bottom rubs the center of the rocker panel enough so that a 1  section of paint wore off  Applying new paint doesn t help much as it eventually wears off in a few months  Now I just keep it clean and waxed otherwise rust begins to appear  This has happened on both the drivers and passenger sides Dome lights don t turn on when side and rear doors are open The 4 speed electronic overdrive transmission has not been the greatest  The engine provides enough power so that the transmission never has to  hunt  between 3rd gear and 4th  overdrive  something that plagued my previous  88 E 150 I have however had problems with it sticking in 1st gear on hot days  Had several trips to the Ford dealer and they never did find the problem  Also the Parking Pawl inside the transmission broke while parked on a steep driveway as I was pulling equipment out from the back doors of the van  Luckily I had the parking brake on which slowed it down enough for me to get out of the way and then chase it down and hop inside before it made it to the street  Van had 6K miles at the time  Dealer repaired the transmission and parking brake under warranty Yes the parking brakes should have held the VAN Now for the big disappointment The suspension on this van is completely useless  With the cargo area empty it drives fine  Load it up and watch out As I said before I have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets  There is more storage space on the drivers side than the passenger side due to the two side doors so of course there will be more weight on the drivers side  This van cannot handle an average load let alone an unequal load  Loaded down with test equipment  tools and parts the van handles like a PIG  The increased weight in the rear causes the front end to lift up which throws the geometry way off  Having that little extra weight on the drivers side causes the van to pull hard to the right  If you follow behind the van you can literally see it dog tracking down the road  Needless say front tire life is pathetic  at best 12K to 15K miles before the insides are worn to the threads and cupped  Rears wear even but suffer from cupping too  Lower ball joints completely gave away at 52K miles  Ford had some kind of good will warranty on these but wouldn t honor it past 50K miles To try and solve these problems every van at the company was equipped with Air Lift bags  Each bag has an individual air line so that the back can be leveled off perfectly  Then the van is sent to a frame and suspension shop where the front end is aligned with special cams while the cargo area has its usual load This expensive solution eliminated the hard pulling and dog tracking while greatly improving tire life  It still handles like a pig and the ride is a little rougher though In case there s any doubt I d like to mention these vans are NOT even close to be OVERLOADED  I personally think Ford designed these vans more like trucks trying to give them a car like ride when empty  Unlike a truck a service van is a garage office on wheels and always loaded down
