 I bought my 1992 Ford Aerostar used in March 1993 with 42k miles on it  It was an XLT extended model  with the 3 0 V6  It did not have dual air conditioning and that was a big mistake  The a c could not keep the large van cool in the summer no matter what  The van was bought to haul Civil Air Patrol search and rescue teams as well as an Explorer scout post  It was an excellent road vehicle  very comfortable for long distance driving  Problems began to appear with the fiberglass tailgate cracking at 50k miles  The door glass would rattle when you shut the doors  and the sliding door leaked badly  The side windows leaked despite being replaced twice by the dealer  The carpet was threadbare by 75k miles but to be fair  that wasn t helped by carrying people and cargo constantly Mechanical repairs were very frequent  with the dreaded Ford ECM IV ignition module having to be replaced every 30k miles  By the time I sold the van at 103k miles  it was on its third alternator  second water pump  third power steering pump  and the transmission was slipping  This was after exclusive highway driving  not much stop and go city driving  The van sheetmetal was very prone to dents  with the large flat sides not having much reinforcement  For some reason the headlights could never maintain a proper adjustment either  By 103k miles the 3 0  Vulcan  V6 was burning oil  I tried to maintain this van to the factory guidelines and changed oil every 3000 miles but it just kept breaking down  The power steering pump moaned and groaned constantly  which apparently is a common Ford problem  The engine in these vans is VERY difficult to access and work on for you do it yourselfers out there be forewarned  One thing that I did like was the rather low lift over height compared to fullsize vans and the Chevy Astro  Not as low to the ground as a Dodge Caravan but close  The rear seats are really darned heavy  close to 100 pounds and require 2 people to remove  The velour upohlstery is a lint and dog hair magnet which never ever comes clean  All types of clothing stick to the seats from static electricity The exhaust system lasted 50k miles exactly  I had it replaced twice with factory Ford parts  a bit disappointing on the quality there  Brakes  The Aerostar will eat a set of front brake pads every 30k miles  almost as bad as a full size van  As far as driving it  the steering is responsive  the brakes are a bit soft but the ABS worked very well  Acceleration isn t bad with the 3 0 but I wish it had the 4 0   The gauges are large and easy to read and the controls are decent except for the power window and door locks  which are right next to your knee and you will often hit them when you least expect it   I m a big person so maybe it s just me  The factory radio has a decent tape player but a horrible FM  Spend the   and get an aftermarket radio on all Fords  Dealer service wasn t bad  just expensive  There is a dealer here in Louisville  KY that sells Ford trucks vans exclusively and they know their stuff  very honest  The other dealers  repairs were okay but they were pretty uncaring especially on warranty repairs  I used to be a volunteer firefighter  and this is not a good vehicle to run code 3 with due to the soft brakes and extreme body roll  plus difficult blindspot vision  In the rain I never felt really safe making a hard emergency run with the Aerostar  Just my  02 cents worth if you happen to use your vehicle for that purpose  Overall  the Aerostar was so so  It was slightly more reliable than my 1990 Taurus  which was the worst thing I ve ever driven
