 UPDATE  After this epinion was posted  the car  having about 55 000 miles on it  had the transmission go out of it  The trans would refuse to go into gear  The cost of the repairs were estimated at 2500  I do also know for a fact  that a close friend of mine who was a ford fan  had also had a 97 taurus  and his transmission went out at about 65 000 miles  Apparently  according to the dealership  ford knows that this is a problem  but will not really do anything to help their customers  I definetally cannot reccomend anyone buying this kind of car original epinion While thankfully  i did not buy the taurus  i still must drive it  My fiancee has this car as her company car  it being a 97 model  while the 3 0 L V6 has some pep  the rest of the car is all down hill from there  The exterior of the car is like the title said  a Fish car  Altho for 2000 Ford realized their blunder  and tried to remedy the situation  The round rear window and the low trunk looks very strange to me  the taurus s sister  the sable looks a bit better from the front  using some chrome accents  Inside  there are a host of things that annoy both of us  First off is Ford s attempt at stationary lumbar support  When you sit in either of the front seats  your upper torso  namely your shoulders are pushed forward in an awkward position  not comfortable at all  The power lumbar in an upper model may fix this  Secondly  The  control pod  with the radio and climate controls is not well designed  First  the buttons are all similar  and close together  somewhat so making it hard to distinguish radio controls from climate controls  The 3rd thing  is that there is no good place for a portable CD player to sit  My first choice would be an aftermarket stereo  but it s a company car  and the control pod limits the modifications that can be done to the stereo  So  we use the portable CD player in the car  In order to have a place to put the CD player  the armrest must be in the folded out position  which requires the use of a corded Y adaptor for ciggaret lighter power  because the armest when open  will not allow the ashtray to be open  Aside from these things  the taurus is a rather safe car  But  if it were my money  i think that i could find a better suited car for the money that it is worth
