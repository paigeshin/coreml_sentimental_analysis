 I recently receive a piece of mail no car owner wants to see arrived in my mailbox  a recall  I admit that when I purchased my Focus ZX3 back in late August  2000  the dealer and service center both offered assurance that any prior recalls to this car would not pertain to my recent purchase  I was quick to put up an epinion about how fun the car is around the block and  yes I will admit it is a fun car to drive  but now I am concerned about the future of this car  I will get to the letter in a moment  but first here are some cons and pros about the 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 Cons 1  The car s interior lighting is not a plus  since the only light available inside the 2000 model is above the rearview mirror  This makes it especially difficult to see things in the back seat at night  without using a flashlight 2  The front seats in the ZX3 fold forward in an awkward way  making it slightly difficult for occupants to enter and exit the back seat 3  At speeds around 65 mph there is noticeable wind noise that emits from the door panels 4  The glove box could use a light 5  Slight odor from AC when condensation builds up within the unit  6  This recall coupled with the other recalls Ford has had on the Focus Pros 1  The ZX3 is a comfortable vehicle to drive 2  Gas mileage hovers between 26 28 mpg 3  Thick steering wheel with easy to access horn  allows for ease when cornering 4  Large front window allows for great visibility 5  Responsive transmission  referring to manual on ZX3 6  Bright headlights coupled with factory installed fog lights offer driver increased visibility on dark roads 7  Controls are laid out in concise manner 8  Driver and passenger seat reclines comfortably 9  Tight suspension gives the ZX3 a sporty feel on the road 10  Good value for the money  On December 4  2000 I received an envelope from Ford Motor Company with those three dreaded words  SAFETY RECALL NOTICE  printed above my address  Inside the envelope I found a letter stating the following piece of information   copied directly from the letter sent to me   quot This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act  Ford Motor Company has decided that certain 2000 Focus vehicles fail to the requirements specified in the Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standard  FMVSS  No  201  Occupant Protection in Interior Impacts  Testing indicates that certain 2000 model year Focus vehicles may not comply with the FMVSS 201 interior head impact requirements at the top of the A pillar  In the event of an accident  and occupant contacting that location may not be provided the interior impact protection intended quot  Let me pause here for a moment and reflect upon the the first sentence of the last paragraph  Why was I driving around in this vehicle that had not been tested for this problem before I even bought the car  I mean we are only talking about protecting peoples heads  So how does Ford plan to resolve this problem  They state in the letter   quot the dealer will replace both left and right hand A pillar trim panels on your vehicle quot  The letter continues   quot Ford Motor Company will repair your vehicle free of charge  parts and labor quot  Uhhh  I believe this is a standard protocol in the business world  If you break it or sell it broke  the seller is responsible for all costs in correcting the defect  The letter states that the time of repair should last less than one half day  it also warns that it might take longer if schedules are tight at the dealership  Call the dealership first and check to see if they have the parts in stock for Safety Recall OOS20  the parts can take up to a week to order  Ford does not like to make it known  but some dealerships will provide you with a rental car at no charge if you can convince them that the vehicle you are leaving is your only way of transportation  The letter does assure that if you do not have this letter of recall  that the dealer will still do the work  parts and labor  free of charge  Owners can also receive a refund if they have already had this work done at their own expense before the time of the recall letter  The receipt must go to the dealer and not directly Ford Motor Company  The letter states that more information may be attained through www ownerconnection com In conclusion  I have provided you this information as assistance if you are considering the Focus  I still like my ZX3  but I unfortunately can no longer give the little car 5 stars  and if any new recalls become known  which is very likely  seeing this car s trend towards recalls  another star will be removed  What new discoveries will Ford find as safety problems in the future  Only time will tell  well actually proper testing works better  At this time  I cannot recommend this vehicle to potential buyers  mainly because of Ford s oversight to critical safety has caused me to lose a bit of faith in the Ford Motor Company br br
