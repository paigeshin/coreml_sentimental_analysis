 The company that I work at owns a 1991 Lariat  that lives up to Ford s   quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  reputation The pros  although limited are as follows  The 460 CI engine is full of torque  and pulls trailers up relatively steep inclines 6  grade  easily  The cab is huge  and easily sits five people  six if they like each other  The rear sliding window is a nice addition  and the air conditioning is excellent  This truck looks nice on the outside  and the paint is in fairly good condition  although off white was not a good choice Now for the cons  this truck has 300 000 miles on it  and has had three engines  and seven transmissions put into it  As of now  the seventh transmission is in bad shape  and will probably have to be replaced in six months or less  This is to be expected  being a heavily used work truck  but I believe we should be getting a bit more mileage out of each component  since not many people drive the truck and it is usually babied  The seats are the most uncomfortable I ve ever sat in  the contouring is all wrong  and you sit way too far into the seats  The headlight control between bright and dim is on the floor  which is sometimes hard to find  especially at night  when it is most needed  The tailgate had plastic elements that became heavily stressed and broke  so the only way to open the tailgate was with two people and two screw drivers  The exhaust mounting is hardly up to par  and two have broken  Manual hubs are ridiculous  especially in a truck manufactured after 1990  Minor mechanical failures  and electrical glitches have put this truck in the shop for much more than routine maintenance  Gas mileage with the 460 is absurd  averaging 10 13  the two gas tanks this truck sports are absolutely necessity  and before going anywhere  you have to make sure they are full We recently put a service bed on it  and replaced the entire ignition system  The company is purchasing a new truck near in the future  and I won t be the least bit surprised when it isn t a Ford br br
