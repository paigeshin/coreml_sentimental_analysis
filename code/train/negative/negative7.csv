 I bought the Focus wagon for it s cargo space  It s great for camping and the hardware store  The ride is smooth and quiet  and it handles quite well  It has a solid feel compared to our Lancer  I wish the gas mileage were a little better  It does have nice features like an adjustable seat belt height in the front seat  big door pockets  seat warmers  The windshield wiper is still the best on the market  The biggest problem I have is that it leaks terribly in the back  I plan to take it in to get that fixed  I have had to clean the trunk carpet twice with a bleach solution to kill the mold mildew that has set in  The other issue I have is that the vent allows too much engine heat through in the summertime  This is a bummer if you are expecting cool air in the spring or fall to come through  The sun visors are almost useless as they do not go all the way forward  They sag too low and block too much of the road  I went from a Ford Escort wagon to this car  The Focus feels like a luxury car compared to the Escort  I will give this car a chance  If the leak cannot be fixed  I ll look for another car
