 Before I bought my  94 Escort Pony now gone  and in its place a  98 Sunfire GT  I owned a 1990 Ford Escort Pony  While not as refined as its successor  1991 models and later  the 1990 Escort did have some good features considering the price  In 1990 the Ford Escorts that were sold in America came with 2 engines  a standard 1 9 liter CFI  central fuel injection  that produced 90 horsepower at 4 600 RPM  and 106 lb ft of torque  A 1 9 110 HP  EFI  efficient fuel injection  engine is available for this year  only in the Escort GT i Driving Impressions i  My Escort Pony came equipped with the 90 HP CFI engine which gave this car  almost  adequate  performance  for hill climbing  but was shy of having enough power in high gear to make it up hills without lugging down  The 90 horsepower is reached at a fairly low RPM  so off the line acceleration is not too bad  but this car obviously was not made for burning rubber  The 4 speed is fairly low geared  I do not know the final drive ratio  however it s low enough so you can hear the 1 9 liter engine straining at highway speeds  The 4 speed manual also was not accommodating in town  as it would sometimes decide it did not want to shift into a certain gear at any certain time  Cruising on the highway  besides being noisy  is also bumpy  and aggravating  The suspension is unforgiving  and lets you know when you have hit a small bump  or even when passing over reflectors on the road  a hard jolt can be felt  Handling is inadequate  Significant roll can be felt  and without power steering in the  pony  models  you better have some muscular arms   Note b  Many options are available on other models  This review is based on a 1990 Escort Pony  The 1990 Ford Escort rides on a small 94 2  wheelbase  and has an overall length of 169 2  The  Suspension  consists of Macpherson struts up front with coil springs  and the same treatment in the rear i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the Pony is plain  and as basic as it gets  The dashboard is downright dated  and so is the rest of the interior  My Pony came with no options whatsoever  not even a stereo  Manual windows  and doors were a way of life  Arm rests on the drivers doors were of cheap plastic  but had fallen off after a few years of ownership  The drivers seat was not comfortable  and offered minimum support  the same can be said for the rest of the seats in this car  There is adequate room up front for small adults  but even the front is cramped  the rear was apparently made for children only  My Escort Pony was a 2 door coupe  so getting people in and out of this small car was a real pain  especially since the passenger seats would not fold forward all the way  Vision is limited  With the claustrophobic feeling cabin  and limited visibility  driving this car was no picnic   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  matches the interior perfectly  they are both plain  boxy  and offer a dated design  This car isn t going to turn any heads  except those who have joined the Ford Escort following cult  The Escort  which was given a face lift in 1988 does look a tad more sophisticated than its predecessor  but still lacks modern styling  Even back in 1990 this car was looked at as a dated design  In late 1990  as a  91 model  the Escort got a major face lift and interior engine changes which made its successor much more desirable   NOTE b  The 1990 Escort is offered in either a 2 door hatchback or 4 door hatchback   Price   Reliability  An Escort Pony in 1990 with no options would run you around 6 000 dollars  and 9 000 dollars for models like the LX  Today with poor resale  almost all models of the 1990 Ford Escort can be had for less than  2 000  I have seen them in papers for as low as  500 00 with claims like   runs great  As for reliability  My Pony was a real nightmare  Problems included  worn Cv joints   torn boots  Tears in the  pleather  trimmed doors  shifting problems  a multitude of interior Leaks  oil leaks  hatch struts went out  faulty gauges  overheating  drivers window would not roll up all the way  and rust was found in the fuel lines  All this  by the way  happened in less than 2 years of ownership  The car had less than 110 000 miles on it i Final Thoughts i A cheap car at a cheap price  The Pony is only recommended as a last resort and if you can get a extremely good deal on one  if not the 1990 Escort should be avoided Happy Car Shopping
