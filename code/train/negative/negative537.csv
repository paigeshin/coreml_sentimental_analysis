 When test driving a new Ford Explorer  it is easy to ask yourself Why  How is this the most popular SUV in recent years  What has it done to deserve this achievement The Ford Explorer was once new in hip  but has quickly become painstakingly dull  The car has not evolved  seriously  in the last five years  The looks used to be daring  no they are overdone  The Explorer  drives more like a nightmare than a dream  The wheel jerks slowly  there is not desired glide effect here  The Explorer s interior as well is uninteresting  the best new feature theyve come up with is the CD dial on the steering wheel  Other than that the interior has somewhat of a cheap feel As the next millenium approaches it is time for Ford to think of something new  The Explorer will not cut it much longer  Maybe a 2001 edition of the Bronco  will bring trusty SUV lovers back into Ford s open arms br br
