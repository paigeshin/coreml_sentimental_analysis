 We had a  90 Caravan and test drove the first Windstar that came out  We loved the ride and quiet so we bought one  Big Mistake Picked up the car and two weeks later it was in the shop for 5 days to repair the A C  I turned on the a c and the fan blew all the vents shut  They fixed it but the car was in the shop for 5 days Two months later I turned on the HEAT and guess what  Only Defrost worked  They said the vents and passage ways for the heat were defective and needed replaced  Another 5 days in the shop All sent smoothly  except by now we discovered that not one roof top shell type luggage carrier fit a Windstar  Ford will sell a  70 canvas water RESISTANT tent type thing We took out 60 000 extended warranty  At 60 200 miles the transmission went and the engine gasket went  The re built transmission cost us over  1000 and they said since it was close to the warranty mileage  the DEALER would give us a little off the bill  Luckily  by now the gasket was a re call   why was I not surprised  I took the car home  1000 poorer and that week end discovered that my brakes failed  When we bought this Windstar  Ford advertised that it had more room inside than a Grand Caravan  After we bought it  I checked out that statement and found it was false I called Ford 800  to see if they d help with the  1000 bill on the transmission and the man laughed at me  I mean laughed out loud that I thought they d help   quot Lady when you re expired  you re expired  Even if you were only 2 miles over  we wouldn t help quot  I was furious I wrote to the CEO of Ford with a copy to Consumer s Reports  I told him the whole story and asked for help  His assistant called me and she said the exact same thing that the  800 man said  When you are expired  you re expired  The Dealer and CEO assistant said that they used to help people when it was close to the warranty mileage but the stockholders didn t get much money then and they do now  with this new policy I told her that it was interesting what she said and ironic  because we were leaving to go pick up our brand new Dodge Grand Caravan  P S  27000 miles later  our Caravan has NEVER been in the shop br br
