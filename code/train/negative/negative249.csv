 I bought this 1991 Ford Van to fit my family of 6 into  I loved it at first  Then things began to go wrong  I have owned it for 6 months and in that time  the starter  the wiper motor  and heater have gone out  I am also experiencing some larger engine troubles but I realize that mine was probably the product of someone before me not taking very great care of it  Besides the obvious mechanical problems nearly every screw has backed out and everything wiggles and giggles and rattles  You tighten it  it loosens  There is also a stationary seatbelt in the middle seat which has injured several people getting into the van  When I replaced the wiper motor I noticed the one I took out was a refurbed one which meant this was the third possible wiper motor on this car  Otherwise it has been great  it totes the whole lot of us around safely  It does magnificent in the snow  Is very roomy  The back seat is a little awkward to get into  It is very easy to drive and seems to be pretty powerful  Gets decent mileage around 22 miles a gallon It has never left me on the side of the road  And it has tons of space to take everything that everyone wants to bring
