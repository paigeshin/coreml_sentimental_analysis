 UPDATE Well  at the bottom of this review I stated that I would keep the  tour unless something major went  it did  At 124 400 miles  the power steering rack failed  Since the V6 contour is relatively rare blah blah  it was going to freakin  expensive to fix  So I worked out a deal with the dealership that I would buy another car from them if they covered the repair   I know  another ford I must be insane  right  So  I m picking up my brand spankin  new Focus ZX5 mtx with the new 2 3L PZEV engine later today  Look for a review with my initial impressions in the Focus hatchback section soon Cheers Ken S RIP  95 Contour SE 124 847 miles  Rack was repaired  now running well but 6 years is time to move on  Here s to the good times she gave me Hello to anyone who reads this  This is the first and possibly only review I will write for this website  which by the way  I think is great   I mean the website is great  not that I m only writing one review I have owned my  95 Ford Contour for 6 years and put 100k miles on it in the process  Consequently  I feel that I m qualified to offer a fairly competent review on this car  I ll try to get as much info in as I can  so I apologize if this gets a little long  I purchased my blue 1995 Ford Contour SE in January of  97 with 20k on the odometer  It is equipped with the 2 5 Duratec V6 with atx  power locks  windows  mirrors  cruise control  traction control  4 wheel disc abs brakes  and the sport suspension  Even after 6 years of ownership  I still thoroughly enjoy driving my Contour  I won t lie and say that I ve never had any problems with it  However  the problems have mostly been minor and my Contour has never stranded me anywhere  nor has it ever failed to start  Below I will try to list my likes and dislikes about the car and as many of the repairs as I can remember  I have had the car 6 years so I ll probably forget something Steering Handling Likes   First of all  I love the thick leather wrapped steering wheel  It just feels good in my hands and is very comfortable on any length car trips  The steering action is fairly quick with about 2 75 turns lock to lock and has a nice moderately weighted feel  The handling dynamics of this car are just awesome  My Contour corners predictably and almost completely flat with little nose movement during accel deccel  It feels composed and confident right up to the tires  adhesive limits  The brakes seem very grippy to me  As that I live in a somewhat rural area  I have engaged in interesting maneuvers with deer on several occasions over the years  managing never to hit one thanks to the handling and brakes  Also  as that I live in a Great Lakes region somewhat rural area  I can say that the abs feature has kept me out of many a ditch and minor fender bender during the winter months  Dislikes   In this department  these are mostly minor quibbles  but in the interest of parity I ll list them anyhow  Tire and brake wear seem to be a bit excessive to me  I average about 24 months out of a set of tires  205 60r15  and only about 18 months before I m in need of new brake rotors  although the brake pads last about double that  Due to my semi aggressive driving habits  I can t really fault FoMoCo for the aforementioned problems   Well  I guess in this blame someone else culture  I can fault FoMoCo for making the Contour too fun to drive  Another minor quibble that started at about 110k miles is that occasionally the rear suspension will emit a squawk during quick shifts in load  mostly on quick right turns  I believe I have isolated this problem to the rear anti roll bar bushings  which I will replace when the weather warms up around here  Finally  the communicative steering and taut suspension that make the SE so enjoyable when driven hard lead to a somewhat rough on the back side ride on uneven pavement  not for everyone Engine Transmission  Likes   The 2 5 V6 is just as smooth revving as it has ever been  even at 120k miles  It is not the fastest or most powerful engine in this class  but it has plenty enough to move a light little Contour around quite nicely  This motor seems to run best in the 3500 to 5500 rpm range  though it is not at all horrible of the line  I average about 22 mpg in the winter and 24 mpg in the summer with mixed driving and about 30 mpg on road trips Dislikes   Nothing really on the engine  however the automatic transmission manages to irk me every once and awhile  The main gripe on the atx is that it is at times very sluggish on downshifts  specifically at 25 to 40 mph highway merging speeds  I don t think that there is anything specifically wrong with it other than bad gearing by Ford  which probably had to take fuel economy into account when designing the atx  Other than that it shifts smoothly  though it is definitely due for a fluid change Interior Likes   FoMoCo did their homework here  the control layout ergonomics are excellent  The turn signal wiper stalks are located perfectly  They are completely visible and can be operated with just extended finger tips while leaving the rest of my hands on the wheel   I think this design was copped from VDub  but who cares  it works  The cruise control layout is typical Ford and the buttons have bumps and depressions for intuitive use at night  The large  sweeping instrument pod houses all of the controls surfaces  a drivers side vent  both of the center vent ducts  a handy little bin for change  a clock  and a useful storage bin underneath the radio  The center stack is skewed slightly towards the driver  giving easy reach to the radio and HVAC controls lending an overall cockpit   driver oriented feel to the cabin  All of the window and lock switches as well as oddly enough  the door handles are nicely backlit  The center console is well laid out  contains one cup holder  more on that later  and has useful storage under the armrest  Finally  my favorite interior features are the front seats  For me  at 5 10  and 185 lbs  the driver s seat in the SE is extremely well side bolstered offering great lateral support during cornering  However  it might be a tight fit and or downright uncomfortable for people that are much wider than I am  The seat bottom is also well bolstered and usefully long enough so that it doesn t cut off mid thigh like most any other car I have ever driven does   I m not that tall and I don t have particularly long legs so why is this the case car designers  The headrest is quite useful as it can be adjusted forwards as well as up and down to a point where you can actually rest your head on it while driving  Dislikes   Again  nothing major  just some nitpicky things in the interest of fairness  The cup holders  The original spring loaded  virtually useless for anything but a can  pair of cup holders are long gone  In fairness and surprisingly  they didn t break on their own  My SE s original cup holders came to their untimely demise by way of my friend s foot when he was making an emergency transfer to the back seat to relieve himself in an empty ice tea bottle while we were hopelessly snarled in Pittsburgh s Three Rivers  Stadium parking gridlock  The replacement unit graciously supplied by my friend is a slightly more useful  though just as cheap single unit which I make sure is in the closed position during any current and future trips to Pittsburgh sporting events  The center armrest is for one elbow only  preferably mine  but it doesn t always work that way  A coin flip or scissors paper rock are useful methods for determining armrest custody on longer drives  The driver s window control switches require a minor wrist contortion to operate  though the lock switch is perfectly located to be bumped thus locking the door when exiting the vehicle  which is nice when you actually intend to lock the door  not so nice when you are say  going to pump gas and leave your keys in the ignition  It has happened  it is a bummer  The unlocking mechanism for the gas lid only works in colder weather  During the summer months I must open the trunk and use the auxiliary unlock lever located there  a minor inconvenience  A few rattles emanate from the dash area  most notably from the vents  The vent open close gates seem to be the main culprit  There is also some rattling where the windshield meets the dash which I believe started after the original windshield was replaced Repairs I ll list what I can remember with an approximate mileage and some comments  As earlier stated  I ve had this car for a long time and it is after all  a Ford  so I m probably going to miss something Fuel injectors replaced at around 40k miles  The car was hesitating badly so I took it to my friendly neighborhood Ford garage  They did the work under warranty even though it ran out at 36k  Who says that all Ford service departments are worthless  Not I  Coil Pack replaced at around 75k miles  One of the cylinders was misfiring  This repair cost about  215 New water pump at 90k miles  Anyone familiar with the 2 5 Duratec knows that this is a common occurrence  In my mind  common enough that Ford should have recalled it  but now I m being unrealistic  I did this repair at home with a little help from a friend at a cost of  80 for the pump and  15 50 for the 30 pack of Busch Light New front wheel bearings at 98k miles  The driver s side bearing started to sing  the passenger s side bearing was fine  but it made sense to replace both as a preventative measure  The cost of this repair was around  150 New speedo cable and speed sensor at 110k miles  Either the speedo cable unspooled and trashed the speed sensor  or vice versa  What ever happened  the speedometer and cruise control took a break and the atx went into limp mode which means no overdrive and rough shifting  Though it felt like there was something seriously wrong with the car and that might have been it for old Bessie  but the new parts were only  80 and the repair was simple enough for me to do it myself New intake gasket at 117k miles  This gasket is made of a fibrous material and is either nickel or aluminum plated around the intake openings  The plating eventually wore away and the fibrous material degraded to the point where the many small individual openings became several large openings which in turn caused the engine to idle poorly  I left this repair to the professionals at the Ford garage for a cost of  250 Very early on  before 36k miles  there was something wrong with my gas peddle where on an intermittent basis  I would push it and nothing would happen  I don t remember what exactly was wrong and the problem was fixed under warranty I should note that I m not much of a motorhead  meaning that I don t particularly enjoy working on cars  I do change my own oil and brakes and engage in the occasional minor repair because I enjoy even less giving my money to other people to do something I am capable of doing myself Summary Overall I have been satisfied with the ownership of my Contour  The everyday drivability of it is still very good  All of the accessories including the AC still work great  I ve contemplated getting rid if it more than once  but every newer car I have tried  Focus  Civic  Jetta  I don t like big cars  failed to be sufficiently better enough to justify signing up for 5 more years of payments  At this point  with 120k plus on the odometer  I m traveling into territory where few Fords have gone before  It is almost like a neat little science experiment and sporadic repairs averaging around  300 beat the crap out of a  300 monthly payment  As long as the SE doesn t drop its tranny  or something similarly major  I m going to keep it  PS I don t know if anyone will even read a new review about a 1995 Contour  but I would appreciate and welcome any and all feedback Thanks for looking Ken S
