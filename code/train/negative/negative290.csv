 I bought a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon in 1994 to obtain comfort  and space at a reasonable price  I have now owned it for five years  It looked great on the used car lot  had less than 100 000 and passed the inspection of professional mechanic On the positive side  this car is smooth and comfortable  The seats are nicely padded and wear well  The controls help the driver and passenger determine the positioning and angle of each seat  It gets about 20 MPG  The paint has been durable The problem is the engine  There are weaknesses in the transmission  heating cooling system and power steering  These require thousands of dollars to repair  Most every owner I have spoken to have reported the same weaknesses  Count on rebuilding the transmission at about 100 000 miles  The heater and air conditioner are hard to get to and may cost about  1 500 to repair  The power steering begins to leak at about 125 000 miles  requiring the mechanism and hoses to be replaced  I gave my car regular preventative care  however  these repairs cost me more than I paid for the car  Ouch In summary  buy this model if you can afford the repairs br br
