 What you are about to read is based on my recent test drive of the 2004 Ford Escape  We went to our local Ford Dealer to see if anything had changed between the 2003 model and the 2004  Unfortunately  very little changed  It is still a 4X4 Minivan  in fact the only visible change we noticed is that the limited edition Escapes were a bit cheaper than the previous year  Down about  1000 dollars depending on what options you choose Once I first got in the vehicle I did feel alot of comfort and room  After checking out my surroundings I did notice that the head room was incredible the Front Head room is 40 4 in  and the Rear head room is 39 2 in  The seats are very comfortable  but pretty boring in styling  they were just a plain tan color just average  The seats are very easy to fold down and add extra cargo space once layed flat After a couple minutes sitting in the Escape  I really felt as if I was in a Dodge Caravan of the late 80 s  It just has the feel of a mini van  I was very disappointed with the center console  it is nothing more than a huge pit  There is nothing there to really hold any Cd s  spare change  whatever it may be  It was basically a 2nd glove box  It is excellent storage for whatever you may keep in there  it is just not designed to hold anything imparticular  The dashboard is pretty basic and boring  nothing really sticks out Once I started the car up I could tell the power of the engine  201 HP  kinda roared once I starting it up  Upon trying to put the vehicle in drive I noticed that the gear selector is on the column  Didn t we phase this out yet  very outdated  Once I left the lot  I noticed right away that the engine had zip  but was noticeably louder than other vehicles  The vehicle has excellent pick up  Pulling out was very simple and the car like handling is a plus The Escape I drove had very few options  basically a stripped model with floor mats  and mud guards  The options it did have like power windows  power door locks  etc  were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle  and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver  Radio had some definite volume  but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise  More engine noise on city streets  but once you get on the highway the road noise kind of drowns out the engine noise Once I finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp  I was ready to take the car back to the dealer  The engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle  I found myself talking much louder than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger  Very disappointing with the road noise  but speed and handling were very nice  More car like than most SUV s The 2004 Ford Escape is pretty basic  and a little bit boring  The V 6 Engine had more than enough power  but they need to build something around it  Car like handling is a plus  but the interior needs to be more quiet  Road noise isn t a big deal when you drive alone  but once you have friends and family in the vehicle it can be down right annoying SUMMARY It is definitely one of the lower priced 4X4 vehicles  but there are other options out there  I would suggest looking to other makes and models  As the salesman told me  All the fathers are buying these for their daughters  So maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing  Good luck in your SUV searches
