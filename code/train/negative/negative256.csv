 Ford Motor Company makes many vehicles in all sorts of sizes to accommodate the needs of its customers  Some are large and heavy and drain the gasoline faster than a reservoir following a dam burst  Others are more economical and can really help stretch your fuel dollars to the fullest  One vehicle that fits into the latter category is the  2003 Ford Focus   a smaller vehicle designed with economy in mind   Features Options b Ford Focus comes in several different body styles  Hatchback  Sedan  and wagon  This review will center on the sedan style  With the sedan  you can choose among three different trim levels  LX  SE  and ZTS  These three trim levels are arranged in order of price and overall luxury  with the LX being the most basic  the ZTS the most luxurious  and the SE falling somewhere in the middle of the two  Each of these three trim levels seats five and comes with a standard option package that includes most of the usual bells and whistles that one expects nowadays  tilt steering wheel  automatic transmission  manual is an option  front air bags  power windows and locks  3 year  36 000 mile warranty  CD player  etc  There are also a few unique options that are standard with the Focus  like child safety locks  along with optional features like leather  heated seats  heated mirrors  and Audiophile Sound System  Fuel economy is very good with this model from Ford  The LX and SE models both have mileage ratings of 27 36  The ZTS rates slightly lower  with 26 34  This is due to the somewhat larger  more powerful engine in the ZTS  a 2 0 liter Zetec engine with 130 horsepower  The other two models have an SPI engine with only 110 horsepower  All three models are available only with 4 cylinder engines b Price b Ford Focus will appeal to many people for one simple reason  the low price  The invoice price on the three models is approx   12 400 for the LX   13 900 for the SE  and  14 700 for the ZTS  Adding options will  of course  increase the price by a couple thousand or more  But the overall cost is still low when compared to the average vehicle   Final Thoughts b  The 2003 Ford Focus Sedan is a simple vehicle with a few nice features combined with some real annoyances  Let s talk first about the good points  Besides the low price  this vehicle does offer a reliable  responsive steering system that makes turning a breeze  Braking is quick and reliable and there is very little vibration or noise  even at high speeds  The price is low  too  and the smaller engine equates to greater fuel efficiency Cargo space is also very good with the Ford Focus  The trunk contains about 13 8 cubic feet of usable storage area  and this can be increased with the fold  down rear seats  The large trunk was one of the first things that caught my attention when I first examined this vehicle  I m always looking for additional storage space  and a large trunk is an important consideration when I m judging the merits of a car  Now  let s talk about the negative aspects of the 2003 Ford Focus Sedan  First of all  I got really annoyed with the seat belt beeper  This is a safety reminder that is becoming more and more common in newer models of cars  It beeps at you until the driver gives in and fastens the seat belt  Seat belts are a good idea  of course  but it gets really irritating listening to that beep  Another annoying sound is the turn signals  They make this awful tic  toc sound  similar to what you hear with a wind  up clock  I didn t think the comfort was all that good in this vehicle either  From the driver s seat  I felt a little bit tight  even after adjusting the seat backward  I felt like I was too close to the wheel  This vehicle cannot be recommended for very tall people  I can t imagine how an individual over  say  6 6  could fit themselves comfortably into this small space  Probably the greatest strike against Ford Focus however is the weak acceleration  The 110 horsepower engine in the LX and SE trim levels operates with a single overhead cam and two valves per cylinder  This provides enough power for easy driving in the city  but once it comes time to accelerate quickly  the Focus has a difficult time gaining ground  This is especially true when the air conditioner is running  I often found that  to pick up sufficient speed when entering the ramp of an interstate highway  I was forced to temporarily turn the a c off  I m afraid that 110 horsepower just doesn t cut it when it comes to quick get up and go  The ZTS trim has a little more power  130 horsepower  but not by much  I didn t drive the ZTS  but I doubt that the additional power of 20 horses would make a significant difference  Of the three sedan trim levels  the ZTS is a little more sporty and it offers the most options  But the Focus overall is not a very fun vehicle  I have read many reviews of the Ford Focus that try to hype it up and make it sound like a enjoyable car for young people  but I fail to see their point  It might free up some cash flow  because the price is so low  to spend on other things  but the fun  with Ford Focus  ends right there  My bottom line on this vehicle is that it s a very basic  simple  practical car for money  conscious consumers  With an invoice price range from  12 400 to  14 700  14 500 to  18 750 retail  the 2003 Ford Focus Sedan will likely remain a popular choice for millions of Americans who are sick and tired of flushing so many dollars down the drain to make a car payment and to pay for fuel  For myself  I will stick with the more enjoyable vehicles that cost a little more and guzzle a little more gas  They might cause a greater feeling of lightness in my wallet but they are also more in tune with what I want in a vehicle and what I am willing to pay for  The 2003 Ford Focus Sedan is inexpensive  but it fails to excite or even to satisfy  Unless your funds are tight  I recommend focusing on something a little more enjoyable
