 This is an update on the report I wrote a while ago on my car  I currently have 108 000kms on the odometer and have had some more serious problems since the last review  I still maintain my opinions about the awesome driving dynamics of the car and the powerful and delightfully high revving V6 engine that powers it  Every time I drive the car  it never ceases to amaze me and amuse me  I absolutely love the engine  It sounds so great and is more than adequate to move the car along  I still waste much more gas than I should  but I can t resist the beautiful music the motor makes when it reaches top RPMs and the corresponding pull it develops  I recently had the brake pads and rotors replaced since the originals were warped and had hairline cracks developing due to age   but hey  106 000 kms out of the original brakes is really something   especially considering that this car has been DRIVEN  The car has 4 wheel discs  with ABS  so the brake job was rather expensive  but obviously necessary  Now for the bad aspects  The waterpump and its gasket blew in the summer  some ABS regulator blew at the same time  the low speed fan and some other components broke 2 days after I got the car back from the aforementioned repairs  That alone would have cost me around  4000CDN if it weren t for the extended warranty  The splash shield has been rattling around badly and actually fell off after the fan was replaced since it wasn t reattatched properly  I ve had some dash lights burn out and I have also had a tie rod break somehow   don t ask   I don t know The car is in good repair right now except for the resonator which is bad just due to age  but the rest of the exhaust system is looking all right  The glitches have finally been sorted out   it s about time  However the time has come to sell the car and get something new  A VW Golf GLS 1 8T is a definite prospect  No matter what kind of car I get next  even if it were a Ferrari  I will miss the Contour  It hasn t been the most reliable car  by any means  but it has definitely been a great driving car  it still puts an ear to ear grin on my face when I drive it  High performance out of a sleeper sedan  I love it  My ownership has definitely been characterized with a love hate type relationship with this car  I love it when it works  I hate it when it s in the shop  As for the bad resonator  I think I ll leave it be  because if I fix it something else is bound to go wrong  I can live with a slightly louder than normal exhaust system
