 So I had to drive a rental car for close to a month and I had two choices  The first was a Ford minivan which I simply would not drive under any circumstance  The second choice was a Ford Contour  and I have to tell you  it was the worst car i ever sat behind the wheel in  First off the Ford contour has all the visual appeal of Grandma s car in my humble opinion  I suppose not a whole lot more can be expected from Ford  Yes if you haven t noticed I am a touch biased  But with that said  I can honestly say I have not liked the look of one single Ford car since the early 90 s  and the Contour is no exception  The Interior is some what comfortable  but the look is very drab  There is no excitement to be found here  An awkward factory stereo consumes most of the center console and the rest is used up by oversized dials for the heater and air conditioning  One of my biggest problems with this car was the fact you couldn t turn the air conditioning on with the defroster on  Now for those who don t live in cold weather  the air conditioner will take the moisture out of the air and defog your windows  Very poor design  To top all the poor layout of the interior  everything was just cheap cheap plastic  Nothing fit snuggly so the whole cab of the car had rattles  Even at less then a year old and almost no miles this car was in poor condition  I hated driving it  Now that I have pointed out some of the flaws of the interior of the car I will tell you how it drove  It drove like a SUV  Not only did it have a horribly stiff suspension when you hit bumps in the road  but the car leaned like a SUV when you went around corners  You would feel like you were about to roll the car taking a corner any faster then 25  It s acceleration was less then stellar as well  Even with a V6 in the car you felt like it would take forever to get up to speed  The throttle response was horribly slow as well  If you needed to get some speed to make a pass you better plan ahead about three seconds  Not only did the car take forever to get to speed  it took just as long to stop  Perhaps part of this problem is due to the incredibly cheap Firestones the car comes with  I ended up having the ABS kick in no less then three times doing pretty standard stops  When the ABS didn t kick in  the car still took forever to stop due to its heavy weight  This car needs to go on a serious diet  Now the gas economy of this car was just as bad as everything else  With my 80 mile commute every day I usually had to stop every other day and get twenty dollars in gas  When I picked the car up from the rental company it had a quarter of a tank  before I even got home I had a gass light flashing at me  Another improvement that needs to be addressed are the headlights  The high beams were average  but the low beams were nonexistant  If you drive at 35 mph at night with the low beams on  you are overdriving them  This car doesn t make a good commute car  it doesn t make a good FUN car  its not built well enough to be a family car  I can t honestly think of anything good about this car  It would be a nice treat if ford stopped designing plain cars that are cheap to mass produce and design something that is better built  better to drive  more practical  and not so plain  Agree or disagree with me if you like  but this car goes into my books as a total blunder br br
