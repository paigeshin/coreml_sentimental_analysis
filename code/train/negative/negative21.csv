 We bought a 97 Ford Ranger Extended Cab 4x4 because of its low price  And granted  it s a smooth ride  an attractive vehicle and the engine has started even on the coldest of mornings  But We live in the mountains and a four wheel drive vehicle is a must  After just two years  the hubs on our Ranger went out and cost us over  800 in repairs  The mechanic told us that Ford is notorious for these hub problems  a result of poor engineering of their shift on the fly 4x4 mechanism If you can live without a four wheel drive  then the low cost factor of the Ranger may outweigh this consideration  But if you re into off roading or just need to plow through winter snows  don t buy the Ranger 4x4 br br
