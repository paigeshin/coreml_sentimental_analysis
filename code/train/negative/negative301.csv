 In  97 I bought a used  95 Windstar  Like another complaint listed  I also had continual problems with the door ding going off  I oiled  sprayed and slammed  but the ding and light keep going off and have learned to just keep the radio loud enough to ignor it  I replace the brakes 4 times in 3 years  transmission filter 3 times and Engine and ABS lights kept going on and off  When the van hit 100K miles  it self destructed  Suddenly gas started pouring out of the tailpipe  Replaced sparkplugs and wires thinking they may be worn out  Gas kept pouring out  I was informed by my mechanic it was the fuel injectors  at a cost of  129 each  6  plus labor  Gas kept pouring out  It came down to the computer which is neatly hidden in a 3 hour labor cost to just remove  Computer cost  260 plus labor of  900  After  3000 the van ran for two weeks when the whole brake line broke Here is where the van becomes extremely dangerous  When towed to a mechanic who specializes in racing cars began working on the brake line we made a shocking discovery  My mechanic tried to purchase another line from Ford  but they no longer MAKE it  While checking the path of why the brake line just blew out  my mechanic realized that the brake line is right next to the catalytic converter  The converter gets extremely hot  heating the line up and causing extreme pressure to the lines  Which eventually causes the line to break at a connection or melt down and explode  My mechanic claims this should cause a total design recall on the part of Ford  These vans could explode and you would not only lose your brakes  but perhaps your life I am happy to be alive  however someone else may not be so lucky br br
