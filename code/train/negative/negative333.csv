  I ntroduced in 1983 as an  84 model the Tempo was a sales success for many of its 11 years in production  and in its day was quite the proverbial  eye candy  Today most of us frown upon Ford Tempo s  The Ford Tempo has set a negative example for many  once upon a time  American car consumers that now look for cars made overseas  For 1992 The Ford Tempo was available in 3 trim lines  2 different engines  and 2 body styles  the GL  GLS  and LX  all available in either a 2 door sedan or 4 door sedan  In 1997 I was the proud owner of a 1992 Ford Tempo GLS 4 door sedan  The other models came standard with a 96 horsepower 2 3 liter engine  while my GLS came standard with a OHV 3 0 Vulcan V6 that pumped out 135 horsepower at 5 500 RPM  and 150 lb ft of torque at 3 250 RPM  hardly anything to write home about  but compared to the standard engine with the other trim lines  the 3 0 powered Tempo was a real road rocket i Driving Impressions i  Off the line  acceleration  came smooth and relatively quick  even with the clunky 3 speed automatic transmission  a 5 speed manual is standard  The 135 horsepower matched with a sufficient amount of torque reached at a relatively low RPM made it easy getting up to speed  While this engine also came standard in the sluggish 1992 Ford Taurus  the 3 0 in the Tempo allowed for significant improvement in acceleration thanks to the Tempo s much lighter curb weight   Handling  in the Tempo was not much of a joy  While the GLS sported a relatively sporty suspension  the car would take to the turns just like the base models  which was to say the very most   languid and boring  The steering was heavy  and the car felt deprived of any sort of excitement whatsoever   Cruising  was also not the 1992 Ford Tempo GLS s strong points  the car was jolting on bumps  and punishing at high freeway speeds due to wind  road  and engine noise  The 3 speed automatic shifted fine  but at high speeds above 55 MPH the transmission was not geared high enough to give a smooth ride  Hills were taken well  rarely did the car have any troubles tackling hills  but again  only 3 speeds of gears really hurt this car s cruising capabilities   Braking  was only adequate  the brakes never gave me a complete feeling of security while coming to a stop  the front disc  rear drum set up left much to be desired in this department   Fuel Economy  was also not the Ford Tempo s forte  despite only having a 3 0 V6  the 3 speed automatic mated with this engine gave V8 Fuel economy  I received around 18 MPG in the City and and around 22 MPG on the freeway b Performance Gripes b  Where was the 4 speed automatic option  Even the 92 Ford Escort had a 4 speed automatic option  No ABS option  Ford obviously did not have fuel economy  nor handling in mind when they built the Tempo GLS i Interior accommodation Design i  The  interior  of the 1992 Ford Tempo was anything but fancy   Basic  is the best word to describe the cabin of this car  The dash  even in 1991 seemed very dated  and the instrument cluster was also something you d expect to find in a much older vehicle  Amenities were adequate for me  Ac  an AM FM cassette player  power windows and door locks  cruise control  and tilt steering were about as much as you d find in the creature comfort category  The seats were made of cloth  and offered little support  or comfort  no bolstering whatsoever  The  92 Tempo was offered with annoying automatic seat belts that would constantly get jammed  On a positive note  the 1992 Tempo was quite roomy  front and rear leg room were better than many cars  and the trunk offered loads of room for a small car   Reliability issues b  In the 1 year and 40 000 miles that I owned my 1992 Ford Tempo  110 000 total miles  it was plagued with problems  Here is a list of problems I can think of  Boots replaced  fuel injectors replaced  constant wheel allignments  power steering pump went out  transmission developed shifting problems  paint problems  clogged catalytic converters  automatic seat belts would jam up constantly  and the dash board began to crack i Price i  New  the Tempo GLS ran for around  13 000  today  thanks to poor resale value  a GLS can be had for around  3 000 or even less  I have seen them in the paper for as low as  1 200 with the claim that  it runs great   Other 1992 Cars To Consider In Random Order  b i 1  Ford Escort 2  Mazda Protege 3  Honda Civic 4  Honda Accord 5  Chevy Cavalier 6  VW Golf 7  Vw Jetta 8  Toyota Camry 9  Mazda 626 10  Toyota Corolla   Happy car shopping
