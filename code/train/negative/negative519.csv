 I would like to start with a disclaimer  I got my  95 Ford Taurus used from Car Max back in early 1999  It had 50 000 miles on it  or so the odometer claimed  Only the gods know what the prior owners did to it  With that in mind  I bring you the Saga Of The Used 1995 Taurus That My Father Bought Me Because Of The Safety Record Lets start of with acceleration  my first pet peeve about this car  You re trying to merge onto a major interstate  traffic is going about 60 mph  your merge lane is going about 20 mph  What does your Taurus do  I ll tell you what mine does  it sits there and ponders life  existence  and the raising costs of tea in Nepal while I slam my foot into the accelerator  It makes a few half hearted chugs  It waits a few more seconds  Then  only then  does it condescend to speed up a bit for you I ve had some very  very close calls trying merge or get out of the way of a nut so driver due to the bad acceleration  Basically  you re more than fine if you re already doing speed of traffic and need to pass  but if you need to get put on thirty to forty miles fast  make sure the oncoming vehicle has a gap of roughly a mile for you to merge into  No joke Continuing  the front seat seems to be designed for and by chimps  Normal sized humans end up having to bend their heads back at a strange angle to use the head rest  and the way the seats are curved is almost exactly the wrong angle for my back O K  lets move on to cost of repairs  Admittedly  I bought my favorite little piece of automative engineering used  but still  here s a list of some of the repairs I ve had to have in the past three years  not including the 3000 mile oil changes I do religiously and all that jazz Water pump  fan belt   over  500  but it was in the middle of a snowstorm and the mechanic had me over a barrel Transmission  a week after the snowstorm  about  1 000 AC   Went dead towards end of first summer of ownership  spent  350  Went dead again  trusted mechanic still couldn t fix it after giving me two free visits  Ford Dealership said they might  keyword  might  be able to fix it for  1200  They said there were metal shavings in the AC  So I gave up  and now sweat my way through D C area summers Brakes   Had to be fully replaced  another  1000 gone Fan belt again   What s with the fan belt  Another  250 gone Aside from the more costly aspects of  95 Taurus ownership  the car is rife with smaller annoyances  There are handy little buttons beside the steering wheel that allow you to search for the radio station you want  It got harder and harder to get the buttons to respond in the first year of ownership  and the main search one just eventually stopped responding at all  So  if I bang on the buttons really  really hard I can still pull up preselected stations  but no chance now of scanning the radio without leaning way over the the out of reach radio  O K  I m short  but it still seems set awfully far left Then there s the drink holder  Ah  the glorious drink holder  Only certain medium coffee cups fit  A Coke can will slide right through  so I use the cigarette lighter thing under the cup holder to support cans of Coke at an awkward angle  If you get a large cup of coffee to start the day  you ll have to bend it at an angle and wrestle it out if you want a sip while driving  Gauranteed you ll slosh some on your cassette player or the front seat  I think the designers had major phobias about people who drink coffee and drive  so they were trying to discourage the practice Last but not least are the lights  if your front lights burn out  and there s someone at a place like Jiffy Lube you really hate  take it to them to get the lights changed  The poor dudes changing my burned out lights took two hours  no kidding  because they had to unscrew strange bits of metal hiding the screws for the actual lights  and they had to do so at a really odd angle  basically bruising their fingers  Glad I didn t even try to change those things myself  By the way  if your rear light cracks  you have to get the entire casing replaced  including the part behind the bulb  and it ll set you back over  100  Seemed silly to me  when it was just a bit of red plastic that had been cracked As you can tell  I m not a big fan of the Taurus now  It has a good safety record for collisions  room to sit five people  and a good sized trunk  It heats up nice and quickly in the winter  largely  I suspect  because the engine seems to kick out a lot of heat that the car can t use
