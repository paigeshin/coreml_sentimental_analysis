 PARENTS  beware I am now 27 years old  I bought a 1995 Mustang 5 years ago  I dreamed of having this car since I was a little girl however  I really wanted the older models  Anyway  I ended up purchasing a red one  6 cylinders  Very good condition  However  it proved to be a very dangerous item on the road  I had little experience driving fast cars  This pony has terrible handling in bad weather  A little rain and you will hydroplane all the way to the hospital  Its too light on the rear  fishtailing became a regular problem  I had an accident already on a draw bridge  I lost control on that metal surface flooring of the draw bridge  It had only rained for five minutes  A little water is all it took and I almost ended up on the canal  I purchase tires design to handle better in the rain  but it still handles awful  A teenager who has never driven a sports car may come to have their first accident in this pony  Many young people pull up next to me to race  It is a temptation that many teens are not willing to pass up  Also  it is rather small inside  The back seat is not comfortable for friends to sit and relax  There is noise in the cabin  Also  he may need to get a second job so he can fill up the tank twice week 25 00 each time   In other words  Buy your teen a relic for his first 4 years of driving  After that  he ll learn on his own when he sees how many of his friends have wrecked their  stangs  he might settle into a roomy Nissan Maxima
