 I purchased a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT 4x4 in the spring of 1991  I trusted Ford since my 1986 Bronco II 4x4 had lasted so long  But with another kid on the way  I need 4 doors and extra interior space  Since the Explorer at that tiem was basically a stretched Bronco II  which in turn was a ranger with a backseat  I decided to buy one  The impresions were good  I drove one and compared to the GMC Jimmy  it was much roomier  and so I ordered one  I ordered a fully loaded XLT which had more options the way I ordered it than the standard Eddie Bauer  The first 3 years were fine except for the squeaking doors  the interir remained large and it drove nice and looked handsome  and with my silver and blue two tone paint scheme  there were no other explorers that looked like it  Then things started going bad in 1994  The whole exhaust system was leaking like mad and then the muffler fell off  I replaced the whole thing with a borla unit  A couple months later  my first transmission failed  It not only failed  but beforehand it refused to shift out of second gear  so it was constantly bouncing off redline  I had my automatic transmissiion replaced out of my pocket  A short time later in early 1995  that transmission completely failed while my son was driving it  Another expensive 4 speed auto out of my pocket  By this time  the explorer was looking elderly  with a couple rust spots and with a bit of collusion damage to the rear bumper  Soon after  the hubs and 4 wheel drive system started giving me problems  so I traded it in for  10 000 in july of 1996 for a new 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 5 2 litre 4x4  I always wondered who bought that lemmon of a car  until I had another encounter with it last week  My younger son and I were in our current car  a Lincoln Navigator 4x4 when on interstate 70  an older explorer that looked identical to our old soldier  albiet grille less  extremely dneted in rear left door  ripped seats  and cracked glass pulls out in from of us  I remember asknig my son   quot I wonder how many transmissions he s been through quot br br
