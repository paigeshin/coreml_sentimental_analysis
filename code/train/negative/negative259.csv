 I own a 2000 Eddie Bauer Explorer  The car is nice  has all the whistles and bells that someone could want  and it rides decently  But within the first year of ownership  I have had numerous little problems  that have turned out to be major inconveniences  The rear windshield wiper would not work properly  The door locks didn t work  Warning lights come on for no reason and the dealer has  to this day  been unable to find the cause  What s worse is dealing with Ford and their dealers  Oh  they do an absolutely great job with customer service  always promising that they will do whatever they can  apologizing for all the frustration  etc  In fact  I would say they have the best trained customer service departments I have seen anywhere  However  its one thing to be nice and say all the right things on the phone  but its another thing to be able to actually resolve the problem  Their cars have so many little things that go wrong  and its surprising how ineffective they are in fixing them I would estimate that in the first year of ownership  I have actually only had the car 10 months  It has been in the shop for at least 2 months of ownership  Little stuff  big stuff  it doesn t matter  This car has the problems
