 Ok  let me start by saying  I really enjoy driving this car  It s low  fairly spunky  handles very well  and looks great  The front seats are comfortable  although a bit difficult to climb in and out of  The back seat is very small and not comfortable to ride in  but I generally don t need room for more than 2 so this isn t a problem for me  The trunk or hatch is pretty roomy  and can be expanded by lowering the back seats Well  now for the downside  I bought this car in July of 1999 for just under book value  I checked the title history and it had never been wrecked  Since the time of purchase I have spent several thousand on repairs  My first problem was the alternator  After 2 days in the shop and a  200 bill  I had it back and working fine  Next came the ignition system  requiring the distributor to be replaced for over  600  The next inspection required back brake calipers for around  300  My most recent problem is a bad headlight motor which sells for  400  Anyway  these are just the major repairs  Add this onto a new set of tires  a timing belt  oil changes  and other general maintenance  insurance  and well  you do the math  All of this happened in under 12 months of driving I have really enjoyed driving this car when it was working properly  It just hasn t done well at all for me  Since purchasing this thing  I ve been in contact with several other  93  amp   94 Probe GT owners with a similar story  Taking all this into consideration  I obviously can not recommend this vehicle Oh  by the way  mine is for sale if you re looking for one br br
