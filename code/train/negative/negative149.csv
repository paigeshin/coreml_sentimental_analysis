 I bought my 1998 Windstar used in April of 2001  I thought I was making a sound choice  I did all of the research  poured over articles  ran a carfax report  and took it to a mechanic  Little did I know  My van has given me nothing but problems  I hadn t had my van for 5 days when I had to take it back to the dealer to get a transmission leak fixed all of the fluid was GONE  I then had to replace my serpentine belt which still squeeks  Then 4 months later my snap ring sensor on my ABS broke  I had to get my camshaft synchronizer replaced   not covered under my warranty  and no mechanic would touch it  I had numerous small problems with it that were covered under warranty  but cost me  100 00 every time I had to have them fixed  I finally thought I was all done with the major repairs then came the brake problems  We had 3 brake jobs done in 4 months only to realize that the hydrolic control unit on my front drivers side brake wasn t working surprise  surprise this was not covered under my extended warranty either  1 200  Not to mention my roof rack leaks so that every time it rains my seatbelts become soaked  Then my passenger side automatic window stopped working and my rear drivers side window only works half the time  I have sunk more money into this van  than any other car I have owned  I m shopping for a new vehicle now because I only have 8 000 miles left on my extended warranty and there is a knocking under the hood that we can t identify and it pulls unmercifully to the right  I ve had it alligned and had the tow checked  The only good thing I can say is that my dealerships repair shop and used car manager have bent over backwards trying to appease me  Maybe I just bought a lemon  but I will definately think twice before buying another Windstar
