 This car has plently of power and handles well  Also it is a pretty goos head turner in performance red Unfortunately  mine has been plagued with problems  Furthermore  Ford  especially my dealership  has been very unreceptive and downright mean  I have bought Fords my entire life  expect for a little Toyota pickup once   and this will be my last  It is unfortunate that this car was not tweaked a little more because3 it would be awesome  When I first bought it it wasn t even safe  The car would accelerate to wide open throttle from a stop  It was out of control  The only way I could stop it was to turn the key off  After 16k though  Ford has been unable to trace other problems  For instance the car dies a couple times a week at least  during deceleration  It is embarassing and it is dangerous when it happens on a curve  They did fix the horn on the second try though  Good car if you like to have a black box in your car and press a little button when you fear for your life
