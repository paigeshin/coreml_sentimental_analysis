 I was in the market for my first car in 1999   and I wanted to be very sure to buy a new car with decent credentials  I shopped around and did my research in the smaller midsize segment Ford s world car triplets  Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique for North America  and Ford Mondeo for the rest of the world  caught my attention  There was quite a hype about these vehicles  as Ford had spent  6 billion to create the infrastructure necessary to design a car that could be sold in just about any country   a concept familiar to the Japanese but very foreign to American companies  I do remember that these vehicles were named the European Car of the Year in 1994 and the North American Car of the Year in 1995  Just about everyone was raving about how these cars drove like the BMW 325 at only half the price  These were American cars with strong European personalities   after all  most of the design and engineering were done in Germany and UK Since I was still young  I was looking for a sporty vehicle  not a utilitarian family sedan  That meant that my preference was for European vehicles instead of the reliable but conservative Japanese sedans such as Honda Accord  There was no way for me to consider a four door American sedan  but I made an exception for the Contour Mystique  knowing that they had European personalities and that the other triplet  the Mondeo  was the best selling vehicle in its class in Europe  In the end  it came down to a choice between the Ford Contour and a true European sedan  the Volkswagen Jetta  Ford s longer warranty and cheaper price won out To fully exploit the European character  I chose a Contour that was equipped with V6 engine  manual transmission  4 wheel disc brakes  and a sport package  I felt quite confident  knowing that the only issues known were a few recalls and the rather smallish back seat  In fact  some people were even bragging about putting 150 000 miles on their Contours  having to replace only the water pump  That was not the case to be for me b Styling  inside and out  The exterior is definitely 1990s  with full of bubbles and curves that lead to the model s name  I liked the exterior because it was reminiscent of Ford s other European cars  as opposed to Ford s American models  My only gripe about the exterior is that the rear is just a blob of red lights and reflectors  I personally prefer the more conventional styling of the Mondeo  complete with amber turn signals The interior of my 1999 model is a sore loser  Compared to the interior in the Jetta  the Accord  or even lowly cars like the Corolla  my Contour is absolutely cheap  This wasn t the case when Contours first came out for the 1995 model year   those earlier Contours felt like high end European sedans inside  with stylish center consoles  useful and covered storage spaces  and well designed switches  In the early Contours  the interior lights turned on with a switch next to the light itself  in mine  I must use the dashboard dimmer switch  a cheap American trick I hate  The dimmer switch even heats up when I dim the instrument cluster for rural driving   that s REALLY cheap  Even worse  various switches and markings that once had been painted white were now simply embossed in my car  making them harder to see  And the newer center console in my car  It looks so cheap and old it should belong in a Tempo or Pinto instead The only thing that didn t change   and therefore retained its European character   was the instrument cluster  which is very legible and well lit  On the other hand  while the stalks for turn signals and windshield wipers kept their European look in my car  they feel very cheap when operating  I can even  feel  the click of the turn signal Adding insult to injury  the dash was so cheap it warped  It was an issue Ford fixed under a recall I had never heard of  until I had my car towed into a dealership b Driving and Seating Position  At least I didn t feel too bad sitting in the driver s seat  Every time I drive  I am treated to a decent seat  a leather wrapped steering wheel with very thick grip  and all switches  however cheap they may be  within easy reach  The seat doesn t have the height adjustment of newer cars  but it does have the standard fore aft and seatback adjustments  The front passenger seat is identical to the driver s seat The rear seat is indeed very cramped  Contours are saddled with ridiculously low headlines  and that means the rear seat is farther forward than where it should be  taking away legroom  This  midsize  car is even more cramped than compacts such as the Corolla  the Civic  or even Ford s own Focus   made even worse because of the cheap materials   Vinyl door liners belong to taxicabs and police cruisers   and are grossly inappropriate in my car  This is the primary reason why Ford never had success in selling Contours and Mystiques in North America  and it also explains why Ford increasingly cheapened these models  selling them as heavyweight  V6 compacts instead of midsize cars they otherwise should have been   Eventually  Ford billed the lightweight  compact Focus as the Contour replacement in North America  while it sells both the Focus and a redesigned  larger Mondeo in Europe  The compensation for the cramped rear seat is a large trunk  unfortunately  fold down rear seat was an option I skipped  and that limits the usefulness of the trunk b Performance  At least the BMW comparison was not an exaggeration  I carved mountain curves with ease and cruised highways in style  even going on a 6 000 mile road trip in October 2000  Steering is very precise  acceleration is decent  and brakes are superb  ABS was an expensive option I skipped though  so I must be very careful to avoid emergency braking  Before buying my Contour  I was used to cars that lean heavily into corners  such as the Corolla  this made me really appreciate the performance b Quality and Reliability  Ford s  6 billion investment had to have something to show up for it  In my car s case  the engine has proven to be superb  It still runs very smoothly  and there are virtually no signs of the 67 000  miles I ve put on it  There is some oil consumption but that is within acceptable limits  Splurging on Mobil 1 synthetic oil seems to have helped   but with the rest of the car being pure junk  I don t know if the cost is justifiable anymore Ignition system was another matter though  The engine uses distributorless ignition system  and the ignition coil failed for no reason at 60 000 miles  After a crazy round of parts swapping  and shopping for nonexistent ignition coils at odd hours  Ford dealers rarely stock these  a dealership finally fixed it   but only after putting in water into the fuel tank and blaming that water for the problems  and charging  1 000 to drain the fuel tank The transmission  the other part of the  6 billion investment  is already history  Manual transmissions are supposed to be virtually service free and trouble free  but the third gear is already destroyed  and the clutch has finally worn out  I ve been told that clutches are not supposed to wear out before 100 000 miles  even with severe abuse  this means that the clutch in my car was junk to start with  Adding insult to injury  clutch replacement will be a very expensive job  because the transmission area in my car is extremely cramped  I remember that owners of the souped up SVT Contours usually upgraded their differentials  fully knowing that the powertrain was too weak for the engine Exhaust is also gone  The 3 way catalytic converter failed completely  clogging the exhaust path and stalling the engine  It was as if I put in leaded gasoline into my car   something that could never happen these days  I always used the best brands of gasoline possible  usually Chevron   leaving even fewer excuses for exhaust failure  Perhaps the only excuse left is the water that had been put into the fuel tank by the previously mentioned dealership to blame the ignition failure on  Currently I only have one section of the catalytic coverter repaired  at least the exhaust is open again  but fuel economy has dropped by about 2 miles per gallon  and I will need a complete repair before my next smog test In the interior  rattles are starting to take over  and one of the radio speakers is starting to die  And of course  there was the warping dash which required a Ford recall  In the exterior  rubber window liners are falling apart as well  The left rear door also has an occasional rain leak I cannot trace Over the years  Contours have racked up six recalls   way too many  Even the best designed vehicles occasionally have a recall or two  but when there are six recalls  I must wonder what the heck the Ford engineers were doing with their  6 billion  The Focus  Ford s newer and smaller world car  is even worse  with already eight recalls and another four defects under U S  government investigation If money were no object  I would immediately have my Contour towed into a junkyard  The engine would be the only thing worth salvaging  and the rest of the car would be no more than scrap metal  In reality  selling the car isn t much better  because the depreciation on Contours has been extremely steep  In fact  repairs have already cost more than the value of the car itself b Dealer service  Ford has focused too much on its trucks  The average Ford dealer keeps only a dozen or so cars in stock as opposed to hundreds of pickup trucks and SUVs  Even worse  Ford s SUVs are popular because they are yuppie friendly  not because they are capable or well built  What does this mean  I get cut rate service when I bring in my Contour  while SUV owners get first class service In addition to the dealership that put water into my fuel tank  I also had to deal with dealerships on several other occasions   often over body work  One dealership improperly mounted the engine after the body work  causing my car to rattle in the engine compartment  I repeatedly went back to the dealership  but the body shop workers claimed to never hear it  hoping I would give up  Only after six months of complaint did the dealership give in  Another dealership chose to book me for body work and recall work on the same appointment  even though the body work was sublet out to an independent body shop next door  which was booked solid for the next two weeks  I ended up having to rent a car twice because the works were done separately   and insurance adjusters weren t happy  At least the body damage was not my fault  and was being paid by the other party s insurance   but I had to do some explaining to avoid rental charges b Owner clubs  With the dealerships being so useless  I hoped the owner clubs  particularly the online one at contour org  would be of some help  Sure  I did get hints about having to upgrade differentials on SVT Contours   which in turn meant a weak powertrain that couldn t handle the engine s power  But I found the owner clubs to be of immature minds who have nothing better to do than to street race just about any car in sight  from Acura Integras to Pontiac Grand Ams  Moreover  despite the Contour s European roots  many owners were of the isolationist  Pat Buchanan types  Everything from high fuel prices to traffic regulations was from the liberal globalist conspiracy I often judge a car by the types of people who drive them  I believe that driving a certain make and model of vehicle sends out a message about what kind of a person I am  especially since I am in car conscious Southern California  Given that criteria  the Contour fails again miserably  I don t have Rush Limbaugh or Dr  Laura pre set in my radio  and I certainly don t have a gun rack or a  Buchanan for President  bumper sticker  Perhaps if I were living in Europe and driving a Mondeo  the story could be different  There are quite a few other cars  some of them excellent ones like the Honda Civic  that I refuse to buy for the same reason   the image of the owners b Epilogue  I just returned from a trip to Beijing and Seoul  While riding on an expressway just outside Seoul  I spotted a Mondeo cruising alongside me   and mentioned that I drive one back home in the U S  My acquaintances riding with me were rather blunt in their response   Overpriced and crappy   that car has no reputation here in Korea  Get a Hyundai instead  Even five years ago these people would not have said such things  knowing how bad Hyundais were back then  Now it s different  Even after returning to the U S  and losing the clutch on my Contour  the first thing I heard was   Next time  get a Hyundai Sonata instead  Considering Hyundai s generous warranty  plus the fact that Hyundai dealers do care about passenger cars  I m actually agreeing with them  though I would rather buy a Japanese car  or even better  a Volkswagen if the budget allows  VW has also doubled its warranty as well  It appears that I ll have to start saving up for another vehicle fast  as I will most likely sell or junk my Contour before its smog test is due next year The Mercury Cougar  which has just ended production  is an identical design to the Contour Mystique Mondeo series  differing only with a hatchback sports car body  Even Jaguar s new small sedan  the X Type  is really a Mondeo with all wheel drive and lots of leather and wood  I know that I ll stay away from these choices as my next vehicle   and suggest that you stay away from anything based on the Contour family  Aside from the engine  everything else has been a disappointment  I never thought  6 billion could result in a car this bad  And if I absolutely need the feel of a BMW 325  I will have to take out a mortgage to get a real BMW 325
