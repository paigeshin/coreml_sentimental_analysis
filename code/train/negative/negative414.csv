  The Beginning  I thought the poor 1992 Ford Taurus could use a good review  Though  unfortunately  I don t imagine many people will be calling this car  good  in the end  through my experience  No  this car isn t mine  It s my father s  He got it to replace the 1986 Dodge Aires he got to replace the Ford Tempo  even before the poor Tempo Burst into Flames   See my review on that for an even worse horror story My dad had serviced the car throughout its existence  even though he hadn t previously owned it  Dad s the head mechanic at a Sunoco Ultra Service station  knows many people around the area  and has access to many good deals when people wish to sell their cars  Though he knew what problems Taurus  can have  he knew the history of the car  and had taken good care of it  as had the previous owner  Despite having 120 000 miles on it  it was all highway miles  as it had been driven about 50 miles each day to work and back  And furthermore  it was chosen before for comfort  something the Dodge Aires lacked  So  he sold the Aires  and got the Taurus  hoping for a better ride  more power  more comfort  more cargo space  and more features  That much he got  but  he got a lot more with it than he bargained for   Equipment and Features  The 1992 Ford Taurus Wagon we got should be considered a near luxury car  in my opinion  So much more than anything else I ve owned  really  to that point  Of course  I didn t really own it  Dad did  but I drove it an awful lot  The Six Cylinder 3 8 Liter engine is in actuality a Ford Eight Cylinder engine with the last two cylinders chopped off  The design for the eight cylinder was about forty years old at the time of its manufacture  if not a bit older  Six cylinder engines are supposed to be inherently stable  but because of the nature of this engine  its not  To make the engine stable  they added a balance shaft to it  and mounted the engine on liquid filled rubber  Unfortunately  these mounts were horribly easy to break  it turned out  There were attempts to use the Taurus as a Police car that failed because the engine would so easily rip off the mounts  and the car in general was not durable under such stress  Fords of this era had good computers  but they couldn t be really be accessed with any ease  Even my 1985 LeBaron s computer could easily be accessed with a simple hook up  GM and Chrysler share a common link  to which a small computer can be attached  and all sorts of data be derived  To fix an electrical problem on a Ford  or get any information from the computer  the process is much more complex  involving electro voltage meter things  And up until recently  all Fords were like this  A big pain Even so  there was lots of information available in the car anyhow  thanks to the Digital Dash feature  and the accompanying computer that came with it  From miles per gallon at any given moment  how long until you ll need to refuel again  to MPH averages  the computer is a nifty thing  Plus  I adore digital dashes  even if this one s green screen is hard to read during the daylight   My LeBaron s is easy to read in daylight The engine is stable in the end  though  and gets decent milage for the size of the car and engine itself  18 MPG city and 28 Highway is what s on the sticker  and I average around 20 miles per gallon with the thing  However  our engine has been replaced with the 1996 model  thanks to the older one needing to be rebuilt  well  see the next section for that  It should be about the same  though     http www fueleconomy gov feg noframes 9151 shtml   The Transmission is rather good  thankfully  The four speed has overdrive features as well  and I ve never experienced a problem here  It seems sound enough all on its own  It easily powers the car to a quick speed with little trouble  and there s never a real lack of power from that 3 8 V6  Though  I m afraid to use it  for fear of damaging the poor thing The Rack and Pinion power steering feels more floaty than my other cars  with less feedback  Its not necessarily a bad thing  and does give a fair amount of feedback in the end  its just easier to turn  Though  after 120K miles  it is a bit weaker than I d like  There have been a lot of problems with it  though see the next section for that The interior is spacious  with 1003 cubic inches  or 83 5 cubic feet for passengers  The luggage volume is 463 cubic inches  or 38 6 cubic feet  which can be made much larger if you fold the back seat forward  The Taurus Wagon can reasonably carry very large things in its spacious rear  and has been used successfully as such for some time by us  There s a series of useful hooks in the back  too  to make sure things stay in one place The driver s steering wheel contains an airbag  and there s another for the front passenger as well as an option  The car got four stars for driver  and five stars for passenger crash test ratings     http www nhtsa dot gov NCAP SList cfm vehyear 1992 vehmake Ford vehmodel Taurus   The version of the 1992 Taurus Wagon we got was filled with all the best features  Exterior wise  there was the roof rack  the 15 inch alloy wheels  no hubcaps  just the pattern there  and a nice classic light blue paint with dark grey highlights  The antenna is mechanical  and adjustable from the inside  Additionally  the front doors have keypads for keyless entry codes to unlock either one door  or all doors  depending on the code Inside  the first noticeable thing is the leather seats  Even with all the use they ve gotten  they re all in wonderful condition for being ten years old  And they are comfortable  with electric adjustment for both front bucket seats  and even air bladder along the lower back The dash is vinyl all along  and if taken care of  won t split  Unfortunately  ours did  when we forgot to keep it all shiny and nice  Oh well  Its not really noticeable  but its annoying  The floor matts are original  and hold well on the clean fuzzy floor  too The shifter is located between the center consol  and drink holders  Unfortunately  the light died in there  and one can t see if one is in park or drive at night  But otherwise it works well  and I can easily go by feel  Its stiffer than most  and the handle is a firm rubber which is easy to grip The center console has a compartment in the top which one can store money and other things in  If you lift the top  under is a place for tapes and CDs  or whatever else you like  The cup holders opposite it on the front click in and out  and are sturdy enough  We replaced the regular stereo  and put a CD player there instead  The stereo  though  worked well enough  However  all the buttons are flimsy plastic all the way up the front  not only on the stereo  but the climate control as well  They break easily  and a few no longer glow green  instead showing the white light below The air conditioning is wonderfully cold  never had a problem with it  There s a small LCD above the controls for it  which give you the ability to control the temperature to an exact degree in the car  It will also tell you the temperature outside with the click of a button  And just above that  exactly the same as in my Tempo  is an inverse LCD screen  displaying the time brightly  clearly  and in inverse green and black all the time  Along the driver s door is controls for powered windows  locks  and mirrors  On the ceiling is controls for reading lamps  and more interestingly  a sunroof  which retracts perfectly and adjustably with the button  A screen can be drawn over the sunroof to block the light  additionally  if its bothersome  The windshield wipers come on strong  and do a very good job of keeping everything clear during a storm  though there have been electrical problems with them  See the next section  There s a wiper for the back window as well  which can independently be turned on and off  Quite useful The sound system was mediocre  even if it was  Ford Premium Sound  as was claimed  It was easy to replace and upgrade  and there was even for a spot for a subwoofer under the floor in the back wagon portion of the vehicle  It s the perfect distance for wonderful bass which doesn t overpower  The high beams can be turned on by pulling back the windshield wiper stick  which unfortunately also can be a pest if the wipers go on by accident  The lights themselves turn on and off automatically  depending on the light level  There s a knob to turn them on and off manually as well  if you wish  Furthermore  that same stick controls the blinkers  which are loathe to turn off automatically in a turn unless its very sharp   Problems  Oh boy  We thought when we got this car that everything was basically new and fixed and in working order  When I borrowed it  Utoh  I was used to driving my underpowered Chrysler LeBaron  And thusly  had a very heavy foot  I ripped the engine off its mounts in driving to college  and made it stall several times  It wasn t really my fault  I was told  though  We discovered that the engine needed to be rebuilt  Not really worth it to do so  though Instead  Dad got a whole new engine from a friend  A 1996 Ford Taurus Engine  essentially the same as the old one  straight from a car owned by older people that had been totaled from the back  Only 60K miles  too  So  he put it in  on new mounts  And it ran well after a bit of adjusting However  another problem occurred promptly after  The hose for the power steering broke partially  So  Dad fixed it  It broke again  He fixed it again  It broke again  He fixed it with an expensive kit again  It broke again  He fixed it temporarily  it broke again as expected  but by that time  the super duty kit came  That worked  The engine is unbalanced enough for the hose to shake and break off each time  This is a problem he knew about beforehand  though  Next problem is one that still is present  Another known problem with the Taurus is the windshield wiper electronics are flaky  And that s true with this one  They don t always stop at the bottom when turned off  and often stop all together when running  Very dangerous  One needs to turn them on and off after that  to get them to go again  The car creeks ominously in turns  though its nothing to worry about  I m told  Wind noise is otherwise minimal  though  even at high speeds  Though  thanks to the engine being on those weak mounts  fast acceleration is dangerous to the health of the car  and should be avoided  Those are major problems  and I know it has suffered more in the past than just that  Overall  its miserably unreliable  even if it is a comfy feature filled ride  I m afraid I ll break it each time I drive it b Conclusion  As nice of a car as it is  its problems would prevent us from ever considering it again  It really wasn t worth it overall to fix it so many times  And just barely worth it to fix it each individual time as well  As nice as it looks and handles  the 1992 Taurus Wagon is a time bomb  and we know we ll have to replace it sometime soon  even if we ll miss all its neat little features
