 My husband and I bought our Ford Explorer XLT in 1993  My husband HAD to have this vehicle  It was great driving it when it was new but my husband drove it mostly  until he obtained a company car and we sold our other car and I now owned this Explorer  At 36k miles I had to replace the tires  The vehicle began to shimmy and I have had the tires rotated  balanced  aligned and to no avail  I have talked to other Explorer owners who have had the same problem and Ford could not fix the problem  I have also had to replace routers every time I have had a break job done  This has been a cost of over  600 dollars  The passenger side rear door handle broke and will not open from the inside  Again I know other Explorer owners who had this problem  The computer died and had to be replaced  Fortunately it was still under warranty and it didn t cost me anything  The paint on the hood of the vehicle started to crack from underneath the clearcoat  Not to mention the many recalls  I also had to have the thermostat replaced because the vehicle started to run hot  replaced may batteries  Have had to replace the bushings because they are located too close to the engine and this causes them to melt faster  I will be needing to replace them again soon at a cost of over  150 I have also had the experience of riding in an Expedition and I felt the same vibration starting on it as I felt on the Explorer when we bought it I feel that the Expedition will have the same problems as the Explorer br br
