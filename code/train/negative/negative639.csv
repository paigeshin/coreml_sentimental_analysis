 I originally bought this vehicle because it was well priced and I thought it met all of my needs  As soon as I got it there were problems  Since then  I have been in every two months to have warranty service on the car done  It runs terribly  The car is two years old and it allready needed a new transmission  The car accelerates slowly and is uncomfortable  The engineering is terrible given that the seatbelts bunch up and everything seems to clatter around  As for the positives  the cruise control is easy to use  I would not recomment this car to anyone who plans to drive more then 5 mins a day without having to shoot themselves  I would also not recomment this for someone who does not have 5 hours a week to deal with the warranty service center  or for someone who likes to travel at over 15 miles per hour
