 In 1996 my wife and I purchased our Ford Taurus GL wagon with an extended warranty  The warranty was a GE Capital product that covered the car out to 100 000 miles When we first bought the car  we were really happy with it  At the two and a half year point  the problems started  On a trip  my father noticed oil leaking from the car  When I check the oil  the dipstick came up clean   no oil  The car was four quarts low on oil and I had not received so much as an oil light  The gage light in the vehicle checks only pressure of the oil  and not oil level I immediately took the car in for service  A failed gasket was found at the base of the oil pan  This was repaired under warranty  No further damage was apparent  As for the oil light  I was told that this only comes on in extreme conditions  The service manager on duty informed me that if the oil light comes on  the engine is probably to the point where serious damage is being done Well  this ended up as the tip of the iceberg  When the car had 78 000 miles on it  my wife was driving and I was away on a business trip  It was over 100 degrees and the engine seized up with no warning  My wife and two young children were stranded for an hour before they got help When my wife called the dealership where we purchased the car  they instructed her to have it towed their  They made her sign an agreement saying she would be responsible for the cost of any repair work that was no covered under warranty  They also told her that this repair would almost certainly be covered under warranty  but the claims adjuster would have to look at the car I m sure you see the writing on the wall  After several hundred dollars in labor and no real repairs  my wife was told that the car was not covered under our warranty  Her attention was directed to the fine print that stated that engine over heat  regardless of the cause  is not covered  We had meticulously documented all maintenance on this vehicle  and even in spite of our previous problems the vehicle repairs were not covered  To make matters worse  I later discovered that if I had purchased a Ford extended warranty rather than the GE warranty  the repairs would have been covered  The reason this made me furious was that I was going to buy the Ford warranty  but  the sales staff told me that the GE product was better and cheaper The final straw came when I made one of several calls to Ford Motor Corporation to complain  I was told that the problems I experienced were  quot due to normal wear and tear quot I will never again buy another Ford product I am only giving this vehicle 1 star because I can not give it less br br
