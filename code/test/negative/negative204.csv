 My wife and I purchased this vehicle when she was promoted to a manager at the restaurant in which she worked  We needed a second vehicle for her to get to work  This was not a leisure purchase  We decided to buy it at a dealer for which my mother works  Kenny Ross Ford in Irwin  Unfortunately  the problems began at the dealership  Even though I was immediate family to an employee  they tried to sell me the vehicle for almost  4500 over the invoice price  Luckily  I am an avid online shopper and visited the kelly blue book site before I went to examine the vehicle  or I may have assumed that I was getting a nice deal  This vehicle was purchased because it was the closest vehicle that Ford had to a Toyota Corolla  we had a 1992 Toyota Corolla that we finally traded in 1999 after having driven it for almost 200 000 miles  Compared to what we were used to  we like the vehicle for the lighting features  like interior lights that activate when the door knobs are pulled from the outside  This is convenient in the dark when you are trying to get in and start the car  Most everything else about the car is horrible  For the size  it doesn t get very good gas mileage  nothing compared to the Corolla that we had  It handles rough  I don t drive it frequently  but when I do  it is my wife s vehicle  I seem to have to work harder at controlling it  There always seems to be problems with this vehicle  I believe it has been recalled for at least 6 items  I lost count after that  some of the recalls aren t minor  There is still a problem with the vehicle over heating  They can t seem to find anything wrong  but I have spent plenty on fixing things that aren t wrong  I personally don t feel that anyone should buy this vehicle  This one purchase of a Ford has convinced me that I will always buy Toyotas  This Ford Contour has about 60 000 miles on it at this point and we are hoping to be rid of it by May 2001  We just can t waste any more time with it in service  Compared to the Toyota that we own  the Ford is driven less  but serviced more at a higher cost  I m sorry  but if that is the best that Ford can do  than no matter whether my mother works for them or not  I d rather have the reliability of a Toyota
