 I don t own a Ford Contour  but I rented one for my class reunion in GA last weekend  I had the car for only 4 days  but I noticed immediately many of the ups and downs of this automobile I currently own 2 cars that have amazing stereo systems in them  One has an incredible 7 speaker Nakamichi stereo  see my Lexus LS400 review also  The Ford Contour had a very basic 4 speakers system that took some getting use to  The most obvious problem was the deck wattage output  With the volume all the way up  sound quality was poor and distortion from any amount of bass was unacceptable  I ve heard some of the Mach systems in other Fords  so I know quality is in reach if a potential buyer needs something better In Georgia it is humid almost year round  so a top notch ventilation system is a must  The Contour has that down pat  The AC worked very well with simple knobs and switches for easy operation and it blew VERY COLD just how I like it  Acceleration was a disappointment also  Flooring the gas pedal resulted in a lot more noise than movement  which was quite a let down for a modern day V6  Handling was a pleasant surprise  especially cornering  Taking a quick turn wasn t at all a frightening experience like in some cars this size  but the rattles from the interior made me wonder if something might fall off the next time The classification of this car has a lot of competition  The Nissan Altima  Toyota Corolla  Mitsubishi Galant  and Saturn make it a crowded field in the similar price range  I ve driven the all new Nissan Sentra and I think it s a hidden treasure in itself The Ford Contour is an acceptable vehicle for the die hard Ford fan that will never consider another brand  but the competition is stiff and many better cars are out there for the taking at a comparable price br br
