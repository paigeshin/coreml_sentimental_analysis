 I originally bought a new 1998 Ford Contour A month after I got it I was not all that thrilled with it Before I bought it I had a Ford Escort in which I had no problems with for four years The reason I bought the contour is because I wanted a car that was more comfortable and bigger The reason that I would not buy this car again is because they did not make the gas tanks very well At most gas stations I go to it can take up to 15 minutes to fill the tank because the pump will click off every 20 cents It has been doing this since I got it and I ve had it for 2 years  Another reason is that it has had 2 safety recalls I just think that if you are going to put that much money into a new car you should not have to deal with these types of problems  It may be petty but after a while you get agitated while trying to put gas in your car when it is really cold outside There are good points to the car for example it drives pretty good and it is comfortable Overall though I wish I would have gotten a different car br br
