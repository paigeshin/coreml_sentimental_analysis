 I bought this vehicle because I read an article in  quot Consumer Reports quot  stating that this was a top quality vehicle and I liked the way it looked and handled at first  However  my respect for  quot Consumer Reports quot  went down rapidly  This vehicle is nice to drive when you aren t carrying a load of any kind and when the sun is shining  The Ford Ranger is a nice looking truck with comfortable seats and is good for those Sunday drives  However  the Ford Ranger is also a truck with very little power for hauling trailers or carrying any loads  such as for moving a desk for the office or a chair for the living room  The Ford Ranger is also a truck that is very expensive to fix and requires alot of repairs that need to be done at the dealership  where costs are much higher  For example  I took my vehicle into my mechanic to get a diagnostic done and the diagnostic came up with nothing wrong  so I went and got a second opinion and still nothing was wrong  but my engine light was still on and I needed to know what was going on  Finally I had to take my truck into the dealership and get a diagnostic  which cost  159 95   tax  They found the problem and told me that Ford trucks need to have diagnostics run on Ford equipment to get an accurate reading  There is nothing about this in the owner s manual  This vehicle is also very poor in inclimate weather  In rainy  icy and snowy conditions  this vehicle is like driving a bumper car on the road  Any poor road conditions and this vehicle turns like a whale and slides like it is on a  quot Slip and Slide quot  child s toy  Basically  this is a very poor excuse for a pick up truck  This vehicle should only be bought by people in warm weather climates  who just need a nice looking cruise around pick up truck  and who can afford to make repairs two or three times annually  Anyone not meeting this description should stay away from this pick up truck br br
