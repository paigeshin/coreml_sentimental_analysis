 My husband was transferred from Indiana to Georgia and decided my poor little Tracer just wouldn t make it on the racetracks they call highways in Georgia  He had one free day to go to the dealership and trade it for something  quot bigger  better  faster quot  He came home with a new Contour  I have been driving this car for over two years now and I love the fact that it keeps up with the 90 mph traffic on the highways  It does have a little more interior space than my Tracer  But I have had no less than 7 recalls on this car over the last 2 years  Some of them were for minor problems  but some of them were serious enough to have killed me or someone else  I also had a problem that wasn t even on the recall list  I would probably be much less upset about this had we not paid so much for this car  We paid over  16 000 for this car and the only options we got were air conditioning  not really an option in Georgia  and a rear spoiler  No power anything  no tape or cd player  etc  I MISS MY TRACER br br
