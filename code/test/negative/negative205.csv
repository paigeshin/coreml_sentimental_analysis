 I purchased a 1998 Contour in July of 1998  I d had experience with the Contour due to renting Contours several times in the U S  and Europe  Its handling and MPG were acceptable to me so when it was time to bit the bullet  I paid  14K new with only a few frills  Overall  the car has been wonderful its Ford that is working my last nerve  In the first year alone  I had to take the car back to the Ford dealership that it was purchased from 5 times for recall repairs  What a hassle  That being said  I never noticed anything wrong with the car It is great for a small family  it fits a car seat and two people in the back seat  The roof of the car seems to be slightly higher than the Taurus  so my 6 foot 2 husband could sit in the car rather easily  It seems to me that Ford  while trying to introduce a car between the soon to be gone Escort and the Taurus  has not really thought through the building of the Contour in America  My car was built at the Kansas City Ford plant and in spite of their kindly calls to see how I liked the car  they still built a car that had  5 RECALLS  UPDATE  It s been almost two years since I wrote that review  There have been more recalls  But at least recall repairs are free  The major problems have been coming out of my pocket  Two months ago  I had to replace the tie rod ends and tires  400  and now the transmission has failed and needs to be replaced due to a bad clutch plate  Ford dealership mechanics have refused to accept responsibility for this problem by saying  It s not our job to fix Ford s mistakes  and  It s a lemon  you should get rid of it  Ford Corporate says  Sorry  we make a bad car every once in awhile  luck of the draw  and that I should save my  2500 transmission bill as there will probably be another recall on it  Other Contour reviews also describe major transmission problems  Buy a Kia   Ford doesn t stand by their work
