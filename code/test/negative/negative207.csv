 I bought my 98 Ford Contour in December of 1999 because I was looking for a reliable car  Since that time  I have had to take it in for 4 recalls  air conditioning stopped working and needed new coil and unit  fumes coming into car  they haven t been able to identify the cause as of yet  and they don t know yet why the car is beginning to be difficult to start  All of these problems require drop off at a dealership  waiting for a ride to work  or making other arrangements  or getting a rental car due to the work not being completed by end of day   which translates into missed time from the job  I have a strong feeling that this is only the beginning of the constant repairs I am going to have with this car I like the design  leg room space  and comfortable ride of the Ford Contour  I dislike car repairs and unreliability I will not buy another Ford again  nor would I recommend a Ford to a friend br br
