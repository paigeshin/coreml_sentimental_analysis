 When I rented a Contour  I was very pleased with the performance  handling and economy of the car  In fact  I liked it so much that I bought one  Now I wish I had bought a Buick In the year and a half I have owned the car  there have been at least four recall notices and several service advisories issued  I have replaced one wheel bearing  at 43 000 miles  and my mechanic told me it was never properly packed with grease   I had over 175 000 miles on my previous car before I had to replace any wheel bearings  I now need to replace another bearing  the air conditioning does not work  there is a leak in a right front body seal that allows water to drip on the floor if the car is parked on an incline during a rainstorm  the left passenger door hinge groans and squeaks  the seal around the left passenger door allows road water in the door  and the carpet does not fit  I have replaced one front speaker and now need another one  I have also replaced the climate control switch  but it still malfunctions during very damp weather  when I need the defrosters most Complaints to Ford Motor Customer Service and the Better Business Bureau have resulted in  quot Well  your warranty expired  so too bad quot This experience has not only put me off ever buying another Contour  but possibly another Ford product br br
