 After more than two years of mechanical problems  we finally sold my wife s 1998 Contour XL the other day  Yes it gets you from point A to point B  but that s about it  Her car was in the shop numerous times for all sorts of problems  I wrote Ford Motor Company to ask them about the quality of their vehicles and received a form letter in response thanking me for my feedback and telling me that Ford values its customers  What a joke  Ford can t build a car that comes close to standing up to Honda  Toyota  Nissan  etc  and they know it  If you don t believe me  check the J D  Powers list of autos with fewest mechanical problems  No Fords on it  Ever wonder why  If you want to spend your money on a car with less than average dependability and fit and finish  then the Contour is for you  It rattles  shakes  and won t always run very good  But the good news is you get to visit the Ford Service Department often and enjoy coffee with other Ford owners
