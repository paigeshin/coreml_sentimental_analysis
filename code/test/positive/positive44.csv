 I recently had the opportunity to purchase a 1992 Ford Explorer 2 Door as my main vehicle  I have since driven it for 12 000 miles  changed the oil three times  and really have not had any problems with it  The vehicle has a little over 131 000 miles on it  and I am still getting the rated 23 highway   18 city mileage  and sometimes better  but never worse My Explorer is a 5 speed  with is a very dependable piece of equipment  Coupled to the 4 0L V 6  it has enough power to do what I want to do with it  It has the room a college student needs to move in and out every year  and haul people during the year  It is economical enough to be a daily driver  Dependable enough that it really has not seen the shop under my possesion  and small enough that parking it is not compared to parking the more mammoth of SUVs The only time it has seens the shop is when I had to have a synchronizer  1st   2nd shift  replaced  Point of note  dont believe your friend when he says he  thinks  he knows how to drive stick  My Explorer does not have 4wd  but that has not stopped me from taking it offroad  Coupled with my Firestone Wilderness ATX 235s  I have taken mud  sand  and water  within reason  of course The interior on mine is vinyl  but the seats are very comfortable  The front seats are a high backed bucket  which makes long trips easier on your neck I have been pleasantly suprised by my Explorer  and from how it is fairing  I will have it for a good time to come
