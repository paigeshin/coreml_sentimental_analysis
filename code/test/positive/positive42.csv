 As the proud owner of my fourth Ford Explorer  I can honestly say the  2002 Explorer  is absolutely the best model yet  Ford proudly touts the 2002 as being all new  In fact  there are significant differences in the 2002 that made my 2000 model seem practically obsolete   New Body Style  The most noticeable difference is the new body style  It s quite a bit larger than previous model  with several enhancements The wheelbase is 2 inches long and almost 2 1 2 inches wider  With a more rigid suspension and better insulation  it also provides a noticeably quieter ride The independent rear wheel suspension really helps provide a smoother  more comfortable ride And  yes  it looks different  It s definitely bigger and the door handles are completely different  The rear window door has been changed  it definitely looks different than previous models   There s a practical reason for this that makes it easier to pop open the window and have almost full access to the cargo area B More Room  Yes  there really is more room inside the 2002 Explorer  I can easily tell the difference in how much room there is between the front bucket seats  This allows a  wider console  that easily provides two cups holders  a handy storage tray and a roomy storage compartment with latched top  There is also an outlet for charging my cell phone in the top of the console  This console is very convenient and ergonomically arranged There is a tissue holder inside the top of the console  I like this better than the previous models where the tissue was accessible from the outside of the console  There was always a ton of tissue fuzz to deal with The hard part about this is finding the travel size Kleenex boxes that fit here  Target has been my best source to find these Junior size boxes My husband loves the  extra head room  it provides  He is very tall and often found his head bumping the top of our 2000 Explorer  He has head room to spare in the 2002 model We purchased the optional  3rd row fold down seat   so eight people can comfortably ride inside  The second row seat folds down in three pieces  giving you six different configurations to aid in hauling cargo B Lots of Extras   The  CD player  holds 6 CDs and is located in the dash  The dash itself seems lower and wider and it s easier to see out     Dual climate control  allows the driver and front passenger to choose their own temperature settings  You can also set it to display the  outside air temperature   There are  redundant controls  on the steering wheel for the sound system and climate control  And of course  there is also cruise control  The  tilt steering wheel  is also height adjustable    The  electronic monitoring display  tells you just about everything you need to know about your car  miles to empty  miles per gallon  fuel level  oil level  wiper fluid level    The   Home Link b  option lets you pre program up to three codes  No more worrying about keeping up with a garage door or gate opener  I did notice you have to hold down the button a little longer than expected to get it to open the garage door  The  electric memory driver seat  allows both my husband and I to set the seat positions we prefer  then when we open the doors with our controller everything is set for us   It s so nice not to constantly readjust the settings between drivers   Heated rear view mirrors  come on automatically when you turn on the rear defroster  The front  seats are electric and adjustable  in a variety of ways  And  yes  they re also  heated   I never thought I would enjoy a  bun warmer  but it will be nice in the dead of winter when those leather seats get cold from being in the parking lot all day at work B And let s not forget the middle seat b  There are  air vents  and  separate temperature controls   as well  Even with two baby seats  there is still  plenty of room  for an adult to ride in comfort There are also  additional air vents  in the very back for the comfort of any passengers who might be riding in the third row seat B Easier trunk access  is provided by allowing the glass to open lower  making it easy to get groceries or suitcases in and out  The rear seat folds down almost completely flat  allowing  44 5 cu  ft  of storage space  Even the fuel tank is larger  holding 22 5 gallons of gasoline   Improved Performance  We purchased the optional  4 6L Triton V 8 engine   With 239 hp and 282 lb ft of torque  I ve had to be careful not to drive too fast   No  I do  not  have a lead foot i It really offers a  smoother  quieter ride  and handles very well  I just thought my previous Explorer drove like a car  This baby is very responsive and handles like a luxury automobile B Eddie Bauer Version vs  Limited  My 2000 Explorer was a Limited and we had planned to purchase a 2002 Limited  but they were in short supply  After looking closely and comparing features  the primary difference in the two was that the Limited offered certain colors that the Eddie Bauer did not  The Limited also lets you have monotone leather seats instead of the two tone Bauer leather seats All the other luxury extras  especially Home Link  are now included in the Eddie Bauer  I don t feel that I am missing anything from the luxury or the extras that I had in my previous Limited B We Love It  My husband and I have owned this car for three months now and we love it  It s extremely comfortable and it is a great looking vehicle It s averaging about 16 MPG in the city so far and we got it up to 21 on the highway  It s still breaking in and the mileage seems to be steadily improving We recently took a day trip in which we spent about six hours in this vehicle  We kept commenting how much we enjoyed the extra room and the smoother ride  My husband definitely enjoyed the extra head room We have the  Eddie Bauer  model with leather two tone seats  I wasn t too crazy about the two tone look at first  but I m liking it better all the time  I ve gotten several compliments on the interior  so that doesn t hurt either B Ford Provided Extras  Ford offered several incentives to buy    750  owner loyalty rebate   0  financing  for 36 months   Look  Ma  no finance charges i  A nice  tote bag  was given to us just for taking a test drive  We received a  tailgate party kit  for purchasing   this included a canopy  grill  and cooking utensils   We received our gifts last week after mailing in the postage paid cards Ford provided  Later we received a  75 gift certificate from Eddie Bauer  nice for Christmas shopping B Highly Recommended  I can t think of a better time to buy than now   great interest rates  extra incentives  and a really comfortable  good looking SUV  I really love this great Explorer
