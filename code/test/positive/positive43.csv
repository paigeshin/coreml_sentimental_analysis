 I recently traded an amazing 230 000 mile Honda Accord for a brand new Explorer  The main reason being that I need more space  Space is what you get with the Explorer  The 3rd row option opens up this vehicle to a much larger market  Most SUVs seat 5 people the extra seat boosts that number to 7  The Durango and the Tahoe went under close scrutiny before I decided on the Ford This redesigned truck is great  There is new independent rear suspension  a new shock strut system  a new exhaust fuel tank layout  and a new footprint  This Explorer is a bit longer  a bit wider  and even has a bit more ground clearance all while being a little bit shorter  This SUV feels solid and comfortable while driving  There are several small details that add to this truck as well  The running boards and doors are designed to keep dirt off of the lower door seal keeping you and your kids clean while entering and exiting  The rear window s bottom seal dips down farther than before making it lower and thus easier to load and unload without opening the door  Automatic headlamps are nice and the doorlock switch mounted near the back door is handy  I have been extremely impressed with my new vehicle  It was a big step to move from a 2 door Honda to an American SUV  I have not been disappointed yet
