 Lets put it this way my grand mother drives this car  It is rahter big and some what comfortable in the interior  But it has horrible gas mileage and is quite ugly  If your are under 60 years of age and want to hold up any kind of an image this car might not be a good idea  It handles turns pretty well but the acceleration isn t that great and it is a real pain to park because it is so wide and long  However it is dependable  so if that is what you are looking for this is a good car br br
