 SuperCab  Super Ranger THE FORD RANGER SuperCab  2003 GENERAL DESCRIPTION The Ford Ranger pick up is manufactured at the Ford factory in Edison  New Jersey  It is one of the most popular pick up in its category  It comes in a large variety of models and it is the least expensive of all the other pick ups amongst the competitors within the same category Ford offers their customers a choice of three engines  an economical 4 cylinder  a 3 liters V6 and a more powerful 4 liters V6  As for transmissions again Ford 146s will give you three options  a manual 5 speeds  an automatic for the 3L and a different automatic for the 4L engine THE INSIDE   OUTSIDE The interior The interior of the Ranger I drove was well finished and the materials seemed to be of good quality  There were no fancy rug on the floor  an example is that the flooring was made of an easy to clean and maintain rubber mat  The controls are easy to access and there is a complete set of gauges that are also easy to read  One thing I noticed about the gauges is their simplicity  By this I mean that if a person while driving surpasses the normal zones on a gauge there is no red zone on that gauge to indicate that the driver is in a dangerous situation The cabin was tight and I did feel that the interior was closing on me  there seem to be very little elbowroom  maybe I would have felt differently if I had driven the standard model The exterior The paint job on the truck was excellent and the panels seemed to fit tightly  It was equipped with a plastic fuel tank  which will prevent rust  but the inside of the rear box and the fenders seemed to have very little protection against bumps and scratches  It would be a good idea to have a liner install when purchasing a new Ford ranger pickup I really liked the way the exterior looked  every thing seems to be in the right proportions and well built THE ROAD TEST The model I drove was the Ford Ranger SuperCab  it was equipped with a V6 3L motor and an automatic transmission I found that there was a lot more noise than expected for a new truck  but after all it is a truck and because of the stiff rear suspension I felt the drive to be a bit bumpy  Probably it would offer a smother ride once there is a load in the rear box Breaking seemed satisfactory on a dry pavement but harder to control on a wet pavement TECHNICAL INFORMATION The truck I drove was as follows Engine  V6  3L Transmission  Automatic Drive  4 wheel drive Brakes  Front discs  rear drum  Anti lock system on the rear wheels Tires  P225 70R15 Truck weight  3 220 lbs Cargo weight capacity  1 250 lbs Towing capacity  4 000 lbs PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I feel this is a better than average pickup truck  I felt a little cramped in the driver seat and the ride was a little rough  I think that although this truck looks good it is truly a work truck I would not drive this vehicle on a long trip and I believe it is also limited for off roaming  but if someone needs a truck to transport tools and equipment to a working place this is the one of choice
