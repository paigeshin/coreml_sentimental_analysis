 The birth of our third child obliged us to sell our Mustang 5 liter in 1992 and buy a new Crown Vic after test driving every full size car on the market  The car just turned 142 000 miles  and it still seems brand new  The car is boilerplate reliable  The biggest repair has been a power window motor replacement  The car s only weak point is its oil consumption  about 1 quart per 250 miles  For its size  the Vic handles well  has plenty of power  is comfortable and quiet  The trunk is huge  I keep a notebook in the car  and it shows that we get 27 mpg on the highway  year in  amp  year out  Because we recently adopted two more kids  we bought a new Chevy Venture minivan  But my wife continues to use the Vic as regular transportation to work  shopping etc  We plan to keep the Vic as long as it makes economic sense to do so  and as long as it remains such a pleasure to drive  If all goes well  when our 12 year old turns 16 he can drive it  and take himself  amp  the other 3 to school  The Crown Vic is a keeper I sold this car May 17  2000  we weren t using it enough to justify keeping it  The book value was about  1600  but because it still drove so well and looked so new  I sold it for  3000 to the first person who came to see it  He thought the car was a bargain at that price
