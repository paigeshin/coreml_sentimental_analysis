 I have wanted this car since they changed the body style all those years ago  I couldn t afford it the last time I bought a new car  but this year I could I m not a mechanic  I m not a car buff  I don t choose a car because of the engine  I m a teacher  I want a car that looks good  rides well  and is dependable  I chose the Crown Victoria  and it has been all of those  It also has a trunk that holds all of my sister in law s luggage with room for that of her husband and son  too  an amazing feat all by itself I have owned the car for 5 months  and have had no mechanical problems with it  It gets good gas mileage for a big  should I say huge  car  I live in Ohio  where winters are sometimes severe  I needed the traction control only a couple of times during the winter  always to climb a steep driveway  The traction control gives back what rear wheel drive takes away  The anti lock brakes have also kicked in a couple of times  The first time it startled me felt like I hit something on the road The car is very comfortable  My son and I agree that we could  go camping  in this car no tent required  The front split bench seat is pretty comfortable to  make out  in too  Take my word for it or try it yourself  grin However  the car is not perfect  The problems are in the fit and finish  There is a wind sound from the front passenger door  the right windshield wiper is never quite hidden  there is a whistle from the driver door  there are several imperfections in the paint  in one place the edge of the windshield shows instead of being protected by the molding  in several places tolerances are unacceptable  None of these things affect performance  but they are annoying
